‘In Fabric’ Review: The Dress Is Possessed. But It Was on Sale. - The New York Times,"The horror films directed by Mario Bava and Dario Argento in the 1960s and ’70s deliberately put coherent story lines on the back burner, the better to concentrate on shocking scares and uncomfortable atmospheres. The British director Peter Strickland is one of several current European filmmakers to embrace the mode of horror that Bava, Argento and some of their lesser-known contemporaries pioneered. His new picture, “In Fabric,” is his fourth feature and his most impressive, engrossing, imaginatively unchained work yet. After an opening sequence in which a series of fake ads announce a season of sales at the fictional (thank God) department store Dentley & Soper’s, Marianne Jean-Baptiste appears as Sheila, a bank clerk looking for a fresh start. Her husband has left her, her tetchy adult son still lives with her and she’s tired of tedium. Dating through the classifieds (the film is ostensibly set in 1982), she’s looking for a hot dress, and she finds one, a red number, at D & S. She buys it despite the ultra-baroque sales pitch of a clerk, who’s dressed, like all her colleagues, as if she stepped out of a Velásquez rendition of a funeral. The presence of Jean-Baptiste, an actor who brings an honest edge of realism to all her work, is an inspired bit of casting, but also a great piece of misdirection. If she makes you believe that this is going to be a less outré outing than Strickland’s 2014 “The Duke of Burgundy,” more fool you. Like Dentley & Soper’s itself, the dress is bad news. It gives Sheila a rash and destroys her washing machine. It will do much more damage before the film concludes. “Don’t tell me you’re scared of a dress,” one character says. Right? Strickland risks ridiculousness with shots of the dress hovering, with menace, in a room at night. But the tableaus work. As much as Strickland has learned from Bava and Argento, here he is more of England than of the Continent. In a relentlessly stylized fashion, the film insistently evokes the Britain of power failures and inflation and creepy public-service films. The idea of “period” is filtered through imagination and fevered memory. “In Fabric” sometimes feels like a spontaneous cinematic outpouring from the esoteric record label Ghost Box, whose aesthetic applied hauntology to anti-nostalgia for postwar England. (Cavern of Anti-Matter, the electronic music group that scored this film, has in fact released one of its singles on that label.) The movie also has an absurdist bent. In scenes where an unctuous pair of bank managers interrogate an employee, and then, later, a loan applicant, it’s as if Eugène Ionesco were doing an adaptation of “Office Space” for an Amicus horror anthology. But is the movie scary? Well, yes. The film spaces out several nasty and effective frights. And as its narrative seems to deliberately devolve into a dissociative dream, even the funny material hits with a choke in the throat. The general dread becomes overwhelming, a black shroud that perhaps can only be cleansed by fire. But let’s avoid spoilers …In FabricRated R for a cursed dress doing evil, icky things, and for extra-kinky department store employee meetings. Running time: 1 hour 58 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/movies/in-fabric-review.html
‘And Breathe Normally’ Review: A Drama That Humanizes the Border - The New York Times,"“Why do they have to live in cages?” — lies at the core of this quiet Icelandic film, now streaming on Netflix, in which Lara, a border control officer, learns what it means to be at the mercy of the law after she and her son, Eldar, are evicted and forced to sleep in their car. At work, where Lara has the power to reject or deny entry for migrants, she declines passage to Adja (Babetida Sadjo), a woman from Guinea who is traveling with her daughter and sister. The decision leads Lara to confront her privilege when she later finds she must accept help from someone she least expects: Adja, now living in a refugee center, who sneaks in Lara and Eldar so that they can have a warm bed. “And Breathe Normally” doesn’t rely on the cinematic clichés that so often arise when two very different people develop an unlikely friendship. Rather, it engages the audience with a deeply resonant narrative that highlights the ways our sense of safe keeping can suddenly be ripped from our grasp. And it reminds us of the power we possess, even when we think we’re helpless.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/movies/and-breathe-normally-review-a-drama-that-humanizes-the-border.html

Late in the film, there is a powerful moment when he visits the site of Babel’s arrest.

‘The Duke of Burgundy’ Is an Erotic Hothouse Flower - The New York Times,"and including credits for “dresses and lingerie” and “perfume” (perfume!) — Mr. Strickland conjures a lush utopia populated entirely by women. The typical household consists of a pair of lovers who are also (or who at least assume the roles of) a gentlewoman scientist and her dutiful, sometimes purposely incompetent maid. The principal profession is entomology, though one woman seems to make a nice living designing and manufacturing bondage beds and “human toilets.” (Like much else in “The Duke of Burgundy,” these apparatuses are frequently spoken of but never seen, discretion being, so often, the better part of kink.)Cynthia (Sidse Babett Knudsen) and Evelyn (Chiara D’Anna) belong to such a ménage, and Mr. Strickland is principally concerned with the exploration of their sexual practices and domestic routines, which amount more or less to the same thing. There is the hint of a plot — involving the waning and waxing of affections and the threats posed to bliss by jealousy and boredom — but the film is less a story than a succession of subtly differentiated moods. What gives it momentum is the audience’s gradual discovery of the dynamic between the two women, a daily cycle of ritual and release. The rules seem clear enough at first. Evelyn, dark haired and nervous, with trusting eyes and a tremor in her voice, is the servant whose eagerness to please is met with coldness, and whose slightest lapses are severely punished. Cynthia, when her research is interrupted, responds with haughty weariness or outright cruelty to Evelyn’s timid attempts at kindness. She is the boss, and Evelyn is happy to be subjected to her whims and her discipline. Except that, as it turns out, Cynthia is herself acting out Evelyn’s instructions, which are neatly written on notecards or whispered like prompts from backstage. Cynthia finds it increasingly lonely at the top, as her complete obedience to Evelyn’s demands leaves her weary and frustrated. Evelyn, meanwhile, wants more and more, pushing herself and her partner toward extremes of subjugation and rebelling when her yearnings are unsatisfied. She persuades Cynthia to tie her up and lock her in a chest overnight and then jolts her awake with a keening safe word. (The word is “pinastri,” by the way. Go ahead and Google; all the images are safe for work, though if you’re a moth you might feel a little uncomfortable.) There is exaggeration and a trace of sly humor in the set design, the costumes, the sometimes jarringly jaunty music and the trembling close-ups of leaves, bugs and water. There is also a sense of surrealist sexual comedy in the way Evelyn and Cynthia’s exchanges of power are performed. But in the end there is nothing especially campy about “The Duke of Burgundy,” which neither mocks its heroines nor the breathless, naughty screen tradition to which they belong. It’s a love story, and also a perversely sincere (and sincerely perverse) labor of love.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/movies/the-duke-of-burgundy-is-an-erotic-hothouse-flower.html
After the Wedding - Movies  - Review - The New York Times,"found in its so-called vow of chastity — which exclude, among other things, any music or props not originating at the filmmaking site. Instead she opts for a style that might be called Dogme-lite, which mimics the movement’s visual tropes but eschews its ethos and formal rigor to create what is, at core, canned realism. Despite the whooshing camera work, the crashing edits and the hairpin turns in Anders Thomas Jensen’s screenplay, “After the Wedding” relies on whipped-up familiar ingredients — a birth, a death, a wedding, a funeral, a man, a woman, another man, another woman — to pique the audience’s interest rather than rock its world. That makes it a fine and, on a scene-by-scene basis, often better than fine, if effectively unadventurous work, in which a man’s anguished cry is met by a finale designed to ease the pain. As in many Danish films the performers are top-flight, in particular Mr. Lassgard and Mr. Mikkelsen, an otherworldly screen presence perhaps best known outside Denmark as the villain who weeps blood while giving the lash to James Bond in “Casino Royale.” The tears only look more real here. “After the Wedding” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is some adult language and coitus interruptus.",http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/30/movies/30wedd.html
Babel - Movies - Review - The New York Times,"divided, dislocated and unable to communicate. More or less as we find ourselves today. To make sense of this condition requires an ambition nearly as great as the one that got those ancient architects into trouble in the first place. Any discussion of “Babel,” therefore — whether grounded in skepticism or lost in admiration — has to begin by acknowledging just how much the film, the third collaboration between the director Alejandro González Iñárritu and the screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, sets out to do. It tells four distinct stories, disclosing bit by bit the chronology and causality that link them and making much of the linguistic, cultural and geographical distances among the characters. The movie travels — often by means of jarringly abrupt cuts and shifts of tone — from the barren mountains of Morocco, where the dominant sound is howling wind, to fluorescent Tokyo, where the natural world has been almost entirely supplanted by a technological environment, to the anxious border between the United States and Mexico. Each place has its own aural and visual palette. The languages used by the astonishingly diverse cast include Spanish, Berber, Japanese, sign language and English. The misunderstandings multiply accordingly, though they tend to be most acute between husbands and wives or parents and children, rather than between strangers. Surely, something must hold this world — or, at any rate, this film’s vision of the world — together. Whether anything does is the question most likely to fuel the cafe-table arguments “Babel” will surely provoke. The individual scenes are sometimes so powerful, and put together with such care and conviction, that you might leave the theater feeling dazed, even traumatized. “Babel” is certainly an experience. But is it a meaningful experience? That the film possesses unusual aesthetic force strikes me as undeniable, but its power does not seem to be tethered to any coherent idea or narrative logic. You can feel it without ever quite believing it. But let’s give feeling its due. The sheer reckless ardor of Mr. González Iñárritu’s filmmaking — the voracious close-ups, the sweeping landscape shots, the swiveling, hurtling camera movements — suggests a virtually limitless confidence in the power of the medium to make connections out of apparent discontinuities. His faith in cinema as a universal language could hardly be more evident. Some of the pieces of “Babel” are attached to one another by the banal lingua franca of television images, as events in North Africa, for instance, make the evening news in Tokyo. But Mr. González Iñárritu’s own visual grammar tries to go deeper, to suggest a common idiom of emotion present in certain immediately recognizable gestures and expressions. We may not be able to read minds or decipher words, he suggests, but we can surely decode faces, especially when we see them at close range and in distress. Loss, fear, pain, anguish — none of these emotions, it seems, are likely to be lost in translation. It gives nothing away to note that every story in “Babel” ends in tears. The raw, naturalistic intimacy of Rodrigo Prieto’s cinematography disguises some flagrant melodrama, as does the dedication of the actors, some of whom have never appeared on film before. The most glamorous cast members are Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, who play an American couple on a desultory vacation in Morocco, trying to repair the damage done to their marriage by the death of their infant son. Their movie-star charisma is turned down to a low, flickering flame, and the easy sense of entitlement they sometimes betray belongs naturally to their characters, Susan and Richard, who nonetheless receive a brutal reminder that even the privileged are vulnerable to accident. Susan — the kind of tourist who worries that the local ice cubes carry disease — is badly wounded when a bullet is fired through a bus window, hitting her in the neck. The bullet comes from a gun belonging to Abdullah (Mustapha Rachidi), a goatherd, and used by his two sons, Ahmed (Said Tarchani) and Yussef (Boubker Ait El Caid), to keep jackals away from the herd. The gunmen and their victim are never in the frame together, and the consequences of the incident unfold in parallel crises. Susan and Richard wind up in a small town, waiting for an ambulance, facing the panic and impatience of their fellow holiday makers and relying on the kindness of strangers. Abdullah and his sons and neighbors, for their part, must deal with the harsh attentions of the Moroccan police, who are trying to defuse what threatens to become an international incident. Meanwhile — or, rather, a short time later, since the overlapping and sequential chapters of the movie are presented as if they were happening simultaneously — Richard and Susan’s surviving children (Elle Fanning and Nathan Gamble) travel to Mexico with the family’s housekeeper, Amelia (Adriana Barraza), whose son is getting married near Tijuana. They are accompanied by Amelia’s roughneck nephew Santiago (Gael García Bernal, who clearly relishes playing the heavy for once). And in Tokyo, a deaf teenage girl named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) spins through the emotional upheavals of adolescence, which are intensified both by her disability — or, more precisely, the obtuse way other people respond to it — and by the aftershocks of her mother’s death. Chieko’s brazen attempts to solicit attention result, again and again, in humiliation, and Ms. Kikuchi’s performance is an unnerving blend of sexual provocation, timidity and sheer rage. Of all the characters in “Babel,” she seems most surprising and least tethered to cultural stereotype (in spite of the short-skirted schoolgirl uniform she wears). And her story, unfolding without evident connection to the other three, does not seem quite as bound by the fatalism that is Mr. Arriaga’s hallmark — as well as his limitation — as a storyteller. The splintered, jigsaw-puzzle structure of “Babel” will be familiar to viewers who have seen “Amores Perros” or “21 Grams,” the other two features Mr. Arriaga and Mr. González Iñárritu have made together. Indeed, this movie belongs to an increasingly common, as yet unnamed genre — “Crash” is perhaps the most prominent recent example — in which drama is created by the juxtaposition of distinct stories, rather than by the progress of a single narrative arc. Perhaps the most common feature of movies of this kind is that they are more interested in fate than in psychology. The people in “Babel” behave irrationally — if often quite predictably — but any control they appear to have over their own lives is illusory. They suffer unequally and unfairly, paying disproportionately for their own mistakes and for the whims of chance and the laws of global capitalism. In “Babel” there seems to be an active, palpable tension between the schematism of Mr. Arriaga’s scenario and the sensuality of Mr. González Iñárritu’s filmmaking. Some of the most exciting and powerful sequences — a Tokyo nightclub rave, the wedding of Amelia’s son — push beyond the constraints of the narrative and defy, at least for a time, the grim inevitability that hovers over the film. The sheer sensory exuberance of the film at once subverts the fatalism of its story and lends it whatever credibility it has. On paper, very little of it makes sense, but what is on screen has an almost physical impact. In the end “Babel,” like that tower in the book of Genesis, is a grand wreck, an incomplete monument to its own limitless ambition. But it is there, on the landscape, a startling and imposing reality. It’s a folly, and also, perversely, a wonder. “Babel” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, nudity and intense violence. BABELOpens today in New York.

"FILM REVIEW; Inside a Notorious Prison, Fires of Rage and Regret - The New York Times","The human life teeming through ''Carandiru,'' Hector Babenco's sprawling portrait of Brazil's criminal class crowded within a notorious São Paulo penitentiary, exudes a throbbing flesh-and-blood intensity so compelling that it's impossible to avert your eyes. Watching this messy epic is a little like being jammed into an unair-conditioned subway car on a steamy summer night as it rattles through an urban wasteland. At any second things could explode. And eventually they do. If the sense of danger makes you feel vulnerable, it also tunes you fiercely into the moment. As the movie lays out a loosely connected series of vignettes that tell the stories of assorted prisoners, the ripe scents of sweat and junk food seem to waft from the screen in a heady, slightly sickening vapor. Once you've adjusted to the charged, humid atmosphere, the movie isn't quite as scary as it appears in the opening scene, when Lula (Dionísio Neto), a desperate inmate, attacks Dagger (Milhem Cortaz), the sleek, tattooed killer-for-hire who murdered Lula's father. Order is restored when a fellow prisoner, Moacir (Ivan de Almeida), the unit's unofficial mediator, steps in. At the same time, a mild-mannered doctor (Luiz Carlos Vasconcelos), whose deepening connections with the prisoners unlock the film's flashbacks, is escorted into the cellblock to test them for H. I. V. It is the 1980's, and the setting is the real São Paolo House of Detention, known as Carandiru, which was torn down in 2002, a decade after a riot led to the massacre of 111 inmates by the police. At its peak of occupancy, the prison, designed for 3,000 men, held 8,000. When ''Carandiru'' was filmed (before the demolition) in an empty cellblock, it still housed 6,000. Much of the prison, which has the color, noise and volatile climate of a festering housing project, is controlled by the inmates, who decorate the cells and have established a pecking order. The strong inhabit grubby individual suites, while the weak are jammed together, as many as 16 sharing a 90-square-foot cell. The film, which opens today in New York and Los Angeles, is a splashy return to form by Mr. Babenco, the celebrated director of ''Pixote'' and ''Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' In some ways, it is an update of ''Pixote,'' the portrait of a 10-year-old runaway and petty criminal in São Paulo that made Mr. Babenco internationally famous more than two decades ago. Any one of several violent characters in ''Carandiru'' could be a boy like Pixote, grown up and hardened. In examining social ills, Mr. Babenco is the furthest thing from a detached clinician. Beneath its documentarylike sprawl, ''Carandiru'' is a hands-on movie passionately engaged in its characters' personal dramas. Even Dagger, the coldblooded killer-for-hire, is eventually revealed to have a tormented conscience. The film's unwavering belief in redemption makes its savage brutality palatable, if at times suspiciously sentimental. No matter how vicious the behavior, there are always explanations and a possibility of something better. Carandiru is a hotbed of drugs and diseases. (AIDS and tuberculosis lead the list.) The film's most ominous, most charismatic character, Highness (Ailton Graça), is a handsome, swaggering drug lord who orders inside executions. He also juggles two hot-blooded women, Dalva (Maria Luisa Mendonça) and Rosirene (Aida Leiner) in a triangle so loaded with venomous jealousy that sex and violence seem virtually interchangeable. The saddest vignette involves Zico (Wagner Moura) and Deusdete (Caio Blat), childhood friends who grew up on the street and come to senselessly tragic ends. On the lighter side, Old Chico (Milton Gonçalves), who has fathered 18 children on the outside, floats handmade balloons in the prison yard and waxes philosophical about the wisdom gained in solitary confinement. For seriocomic relief, the regal, wisecracking Lady Di (Rodrigo Santoro), who is on female hormones and boasts of having had 2,000 lovers, and her gnarly, dwarfish fiancé, No Way (Gero Camilo), wait apprehensively for their H. I. V. test results. Just when the movie threatens to go soft, ''Carandiru'' erupts in what may be the most horrific and sustained prison riot ever filmed. By the end of the movie's jaw-dropping re-creation of the 1992 mass slaughter by the police (who lost none of their own), its stairs are ankle-deep in streaming blood, mud and trash. But there's a small, troubling hole at the center of the movie. When all is said and done, the calm, sympathetic doctor who volunteers his services at Carandiru and becomes a trusted visitor remains a benign cipher, an almost entirely forgettable presence. Despite its confusion and the broadness of many of its strokes, the movie belongs to a Latin American tradition of heartfelt social realism in which the struggles of ordinary people assume a heroic dimension. The film is undeniably the work of an artist with the strength to gaze into the abyss and return, his humanity fortified.''Carandiru''is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence, sexual situations and very strong language.

Babe the pig, he of the sweet voice and twitchy pink snout, spends his second film in considerably more daunting surroundings than those of the Hoggetts (James Cromwell and Magda Szubanski) and their farm. In ''Babe: Pig in the City'' his new friends include chimps and a pit bull, signaling the obviously less lighthearted quality of this sequel. As directed once again by George Miller, Babe remains a cute little porker, but his fanciful new backdrops are less beguiling. Despite his mandate (from his dog mother, with the voice of Miriam Margolyes) to demonstrate ''how a kind and steady heart can mend a sorry world,'' Babe must contend here with many discouraging urban woes. Chief among them is Mickey Rooney as a dissipated circus clown, possibly cast here to show how much more refreshing Babe is than many human beings. This film's occasional taste for dark moments and unappetizing sights makes its G rating somewhat questionable for very young children. The plot contrives to send Farmer Hoggett down a well in a nasty accident. Then Babe and Esme Hoggett head for the city, hoping to save the farm. Much fun is made of Ms. Szubanski's sturdy Esme, who becomes the subject of endless fat jokes as well as a police strip-search at the airport. It seems that a drug-sniffing dog has detected contraband somewhere, and anyone eager to explain that to tots should have no problem with the rest of the story. It brings Babe and Esme to a fleabag -- the Flealands Hotel -- where animals are officially outlawed but actually welcome. Here, at this menagerie-filled version of the Chelsea, Babe finds the kind of urban demimonde he never saw on the farm. There is an orangutan named Thelonius (get it?) and a family of world-weary chimps (with Steven Wright providing the wise-guy father's voice, and Glenne Headly as the pregnant, floozyish mother). Continuing his walk on the wild side, Babe also meets a pink poodle with Blanche DuBois tendencies and squads of cats and dogs who behave like members of rival gangs. Sheepherding contests, anyone? There's plenty to be said about the urban troubles seen here, but it's not best heard out of the mouth of Babe. This visually ambitious film does concoct an elaborate pan-metropolis including traces of New York, Hollywood, San Francisco, Paris, Venice and so on. And the Flealands Hotel becomes an enveloping setting, even if its gloom spoils some of the fun. There's some good news in the fact that Babe's mouse friends come along for the journey, and that their musical tastes (''Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien,'' ''That's Amore,'' ''Are You Lonesome Tonight?'') remain as adorably eclectic as ever. The cats who greet them with a chorus of ''Three Blind Mice'' are also a nice touch. But by the time Esme has wound up in the clown's purple suit and is swinging from a chandelier across a ballroom, this ''Babe'' has all but lost its bearings. It will work as a sequel only hard-core ''Babe'' fans willing to follow this four-legged hero (or heroine, as Babe obviously is in some scenes) anywhere. Had ''Pig in the City'' been made first, it by no means could have prompted a sequel of its own.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Courtney Love is one rock performer who has never been at a loss for words. And in ''Not Bad for a Girl,'' Lisa Rose Apramian's noisy documentary study of female hard-rockers, she is given the movie's parting shot. Instead of having to get the football captain, she advises, ''Be the football captain.''In an even more hyperbolic mode, she also describes herself as ''a Christ figure'' who is ''trying to heal'' and identifies with Vincent van Gogh. Her grandiose descriptions of her own wildly disheveled stage behavior range from ''total masochism'' to ''martyrdom.''''I want to affect culture in a large way,'' she declares. Ms. Love is one of the two most articulate performers interviewed for the movie, whose subtitle, ''an analytic approach to the functions of music and gender deconstruction,'' accurately describes the film maker's agenda. The other is Joan Jett, the tough but dignified, deep-voiced leader of the groundbreaking all-female 70's band, the Runaways. Ms. Jett is as cool and terse as Ms. Love is ramblingly outspoken. ''Being physical and getting onstage and really letting it out and sweating profusely doesn't sound like a feminine thing,'' she says, ''but to me it's very sexy.'' She goes on to state what the film makes perfectly obvious, that ''girls can rock as hard as men.''For all its polemical clout, this 16-millimeter movie, which opens today at Cinema Village, is as crude and messy as the music that punctuates the interviews. The film dashes madly from performer to performer, focusing on members of the all-female bands L7, Babes in Toyland and Lunachicks, but chopping up the interviews into snippets that are so short that continuity is often lost. Side trips are made to the 1992 Riot Grrrls' Convention in Washington and to the Rock 'n' Roll High School, a music academy for girls in Melbourne, Australia. Although each musician has a different story, a rough composite image of the female hard-rocker still emerges. And anger has surprisingly little to do with the cathartic pleasure these women take in screaming, howling and making snarling instrumental sounds. Most of the performers are aware of a moment in early adolescence when their female peers changed from tomboys into boy-chasing supplicants. For various reasons, they refused to subscribe to a change in attitude they sensed was more the result of powerful social conditioning than their own biology. Since conforming would mean reining in their natural exuberance, they made a choice not to. This is clearly Ms. Apramian's view, and she gets her subjects to confirm it. NOT BAD FOR A GIRLWritten, produced and directed by Lisa Rose Apramian; editor and co-writer, Kyle C. Kyle; released by Horizon Unlimited. At Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village.

From 1944 to 1945, Mike Siegelbaum wrote to his wife, Hazel, almost every day. His letters form the core of the film, read by a narrator, and their very ordinariness becomes the point. If ever there was a regular Joe (though a bit more devoted and thoughtful than most), it was Mike Siegelbaum. He begins his letters ""Dear Babe,"" and during the start of his service says things are ""swell."" He also notices some revealing details, including how some white soldiers look away to avoid saluting black officers. The letters take him from training camp to the European front, where censors wouldn't allow him to say anything important. He admits and apologizes for that, and his letters become a chronicle of a soldier's daily life. He writes that he is ""somewhere in France,"" that he has named his truck the Staten Island Ferry, that the weather is bitterly cold. Though Mike Siegelbaum died in 1991, the film includes interviews with Hazel Siegelbaum (who died in July 1995) and other family members. Mrs. Siegelbaum recalls that though her husband helped liberate a concentration camp, he said very little about the experience, except that the smell was overwhelming. The major problem with ""Dear Babe,"" which opened yesterday at the Quad, is that much of the visual background is composed of stock wartime film, showing troop ships and barracks and soldiers who have nothing to do with this documentary. (There are some family photographs as well.) Those stock images are too familiar to make ""Dear Babe"" exceptional as a piece of film making. This very small movie works best as a daughter's tender memoir. DEAR BABE Written and directed by Rosanne Ehrlich; director of photography, Greg Andrake; edited by David J. Wilson; produced by Ms. Ehrlich and Mr. Wilson; released by Stratton Films. At the Quad Cinema, 13th Street, west of Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village. Running time: 82 minutes. This film is not rated. WITH: Hazel Siegelbaum (Mike's wife), Paul Siegelbaum (his son) and Fred Blau (his brother-in-law); narration by Dean Coleman.",http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/28/movies/film-review-letters-of-love-and-war.html

The title character of ""Babe,"" an endearing children's movie from Australia, is a plucky little pig who rebels from his assigned role in barnyard society and insists on behaving like a sheepdog. Adapted from Dick King-Smith's book ""The Sheep-Pig,"" the movie maintains a refreshingly light touch in spinning a fable about individualism and conformity. The one incongruous element is an overbearing ""Rocky""-style soundtrack that treats Babe's canine aspirations as an Olympian quest for gold. The movie's blending of real animals and computer-animated puppetry is seamless to the point that one hardly notices the shifts. And the actors' voices imbuing farm animals and domestic pets with distinctive personalities are unusually well chosen and imaginative. Particularly evocative are Hugo Weaving as Rex, a proud, short-tempered sheepdog with a hearing disability; Evelyn Krape as Old Ewe, the fussy but good-hearted grande dame of the farm's flock of sheep, and Danny Mann as Ferdinand, a cheeky duck who dreams of being a rooster. Narrated by Roscoe Lee Browne, the story unfolds as a series of episodic vignettes introduced by chapter titles, which follow the rites of passage of Babe, whom Christine Cavanaugh plays as a slightly timid but ultimately brave child. When Babe goes to live with Farmer Hoggett (James Crowell) and his wife (Magda Szubanski), he is taken under the wing of Fly (Miriam Margolyes), a maternal sheepdog who knows the ways of the farm. In his first misadventure, Babe breaks the rules and creates havoc by venturing indoors with Ferdinand to try to steal an alarm clock that the duck feels has usurped his roosterlike role. At holiday time, there is much suspense over whether the Hoggett family will choose duck a l'orange or roast pork for its Christmas dinner. Babe's life is spared when duck is chosen. A crisis erupts when a pack of wild dogs attacks the sheep herd. Babe, who is initially blamed, becomes a hero when it is revealed that he scared the dogs away. Babe's heroism so irks Farmer Hoggett's arrogant house cat that the feline takes revenge by informing Babe that the pig's only purpose on the farm is to be food for the farmer. Once Babe demonstrates his sheep-herding skills to Farmer Hoggett, his fate doesn't seem so brutally sealed. The film's comic high point is Babe's hilarious performance at a sheep-herding contest. The movie, directed by Chris Noonan, who wrote the screenplay with George Miller, takes a child's-eye view of a world that is photographed to look like a storybook come to life. Without bearing down too heavily, the movie suggests the Darwinian order of things, and Babe's experiences (except for his final preposterous triumph) roughly parallel a child's awakenings to the realities of the world. The movie is also a porcine public-relations coup. With his snowy coat, wiggling pink snout and floppy ears, Babe is a charmer. BABE Directed by Chris Noonan; written by George Miller and Mr. Noonan, based on the novel ""Babe, the Gallant Pig,"" by Dick King-Smith; director of photography, Andrew Lesnie; edited by Marcus D'Arcy and Jay Friedkin; music by Nigel Westlake; production designer, Roger Ford; animatronics by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, John Cox and Robotechnology, and Rhythm and Hues; produced by George Miller, Doug Mitchell and Bill Miller; released by Universal Pictures.

"Review/Film; Saving the Savages, but Losing Themselves - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from December 6, 1991, Section C, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""At Play in the Fields of the Lord,"" Hector Babenco's adaptation of the Peter Matthiessen novel, is a big, melancholy screen adventure, vividly realized in the jungles of Brazil, about people out of touch with one another and at dangerous odds with a primeval world they understand not at all. With fidelity to the book, and to the look, sound, heat and wet of the exotic locale, Mr. Babenco evokes the arrogant confusion of a small group of mismatched North Americans, caught in a brutal landscape that overwhelms them even as it's disappearing. Though the movie sometimes has trouble expressing what's on its mind, it is a rare movie in that it has something on its mind to express. The principal characters include a pair of mangy bush pilots, Moon (Tom Berenger) and Wolf (Tom Waits), who, low on money and gas, are stranded at a godforsaken jungle outpost, their passports and single-engine plane impounded. Wolf is a profane, hard-drinking urban lout. Moon is a moody loner, who is also half American Indian. Also in the village, staying at the only hotel, are two youngish missionary couples, Leslie and Andy Huben (John Lithgow and Daryl Hannah) and Martin and Hazel Quarrier (Aidan Quinn and Kathy Bates) who, with their small son, have just arrived from the States. The Hubens and the Quarriers share an earnest, psalm-singing, fundamentalist Christian faith. They are out to save the savages (Hazel Quarrier's term) from their Stone Age ways and from the Roman Catholic priests who, if they could, would have saved the savages first. The screenplay, adapted by Jean-Claude Carriere and Mr. Babenco, tells several stories simultaneously. It's about Moon's reverse conversion when he leaves civilization's squalid outpost to join the Niarunas, an especially primitive Indian tribe he associates with his own North American people. It's also about the missionaries' attempt to set up a jungle church to convert the Niaruna, about the collapse of the courage of one of the missionaries, the loss of faith of another and the madness of a third. ""At Play in the Fields of the Lord"" doesn't play smoothly, but it often plays well. The film's most interesting character, acted by Mr. Quinn with a secretive kind of intelligence, is Martin Quarrier. Trapped in a marriage to a woman of small, unstable mind, Martin would honor both his marriage and his faith and becomes, almost in spite of himself, heroic. Unlike the Quarriers' marriage, the Hubens' appears to be a happy one. It seems to be a true union of body, mind and spirit, but then it become apparent that Leslie Huben is the sort of man who is more skillful at public relations and moral compromises than at his work in the field. Except for the particular crisis that these missionaries must face, the Hubens' marriage would probably have been a long and satisfying one. Though the enlightened Martin Quarrier is the center of the film, the character on whom the film rests is Moon, whose search for identity is not dramatized in any convincing way. It isn't just that the movie cannot enter Moon's thoughts. The novel has the same problem, even though Mr. Matthiessen devotes many pages to Moon's drug-induced hallucinations before he makes his big leap to freedom.""At Play in the Fields of the Lord"" looks sensationally good. There is no faking these jungle locations, whether seen from the air, as Moon's fragile plane flies wanly into a time long past, or on the ground, where the flora can be as malignant as the fauna. A number of individual scenes stand out, including an early bar encounter of the drunken Moon with the naive Martin Quarrier and an amused, patient Catholic priest. Says Moon, ""If the Lord made Indians the way they are, who are you to make them different?"" That is the film's worthy but not exactly novel point. The life at the jungle church settlement is richly realized. Yet an important scene, in which the beautiful Andy Huben goes skinny-dipping, seems wildly out of place, if only because Miss Hannah's body looks too magnificent to be entirely true in these circumstances. The scene is essential to everything that happens afterward and is taken directly from the book, but fidelity sometimes backfires. Mr. Lithgow and Miss Hannah, who grows more secure as an actress with every film, are fine in complex roles that are exceptionally well written. Miss Bates is splendid as a big, slow, furious and frightened woman, someone who should never have ventured south of Orlando, Fla. Mr. Berenger maintains his self-respect in sequences that often suggest the National Geographic come to life. Though the film features a spectacular penultimate sequence, it seems not to know how to end. It sort of drifts away, perhaps trying to soften its own well-earned pessimism. Whatever the reason, ""At Play in the Fields of the Lord"" leaves one a bit bemused, vaguely worrying about the fate of the rain forests and the ozone layer as the endangered Indians. To this extent, the movie can be said to engage the intellect somewhat more than the emotions.""At Play in the Fields of the Lord,"" which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has nudity, violence and vulgar language.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. AT the age of 40, Klaus Drittemann, a writer and performer of protest songs, is given a one-way visa to leave East Germany for the West. Klaus has been in trouble with the authorities ever since the 1960's. He's a bristly character and has been a merciless critic of the East German Government for failures to realize its Marxist aspirations. On the occasion of one of his earlier arrests, Klaus refused to recant or even to apologize. As he told his unhappy lawyer, ''I have plans for this country.'' Henceforth, he's no longer allowed to perform. When Klaus arrives in West Berlin, things aren't much better, even though he's enthusiastically welcomed by his recording company and by representatives of the West German and American Governments, which want to capitalize on what they choose to call his ''defection.'' At a press conference, he makes rude remarks to the West German minister of culture about the ''freedom'' of the West German unemployed and of former Nazis occupying important Government positions. Klaus is an unsmiling moralist. Like his father, a concert pianist who defected when Klaus was a boy, he's a man of stern principles. Yet, as played by Gerulf Pannach, a stocky, sardonic East German writer and performer whose own story parallels that of Klaus, he's a remarkably moving character. He persists in his refusal to believe there are only two choices left in this world, that is, to support either the East or the West. Klaus Drittemann (whose last name translates rather too conveniently as ''third man'') is the central figure in ''Singing the Blues in Red,'' opening today at the Quad Cinema. Though it was made mostly in Germany in German (with English subtitles), ''Singing the Blues in Red'' is an English film. It was written by Trevor Griffiths, who collaborated with Warren Beatty on the screenplay for ''Reds,'' and directed by Kenneth Loach (''Kes,'' ''Poor Cow,'' ''The Game Keeper''). There's even something that's more English than German about the film's willingness to dramatize not a middle-road but a redefined, purified, pre-Stalinist left. It seems that for Mr. Loach and Mr. Griffiths, the divided city of Berlin, with its rampant consumerism on one side, and bumbling neo-socialism on the other, represents the truth not only of Germany, but also of a Britain where a divided left faces the triumphant Tory Government of Margaret Thatcher. In pursuing Klaus's search for his long-lost father, who's finally found living under an assumed named in Cambridge, the narrative of ''Singing the Blues in Red'' becomes a bit tortured to make its points about power, whether in the hands of opportunists of left or right. The film contains a lot of skeletons jammed into one small closet. However, it also demonstrates an invigorating, completely independent moral perspective, which isn't very fashionable today and not easily dramatized.''Singing the Blues in Red'' is most effective when it's simply observing the details of Klaus's divided life before he leaves East Germany and, later, when he becomes the subject of a would-be publicity coup in West Berlin. Though the film's portrait of Western decadence is laid on with a trowel, it's also pretty funny. More important, Mr. Loach and Mr. Pannach succeed in communicating a lot of Klaus's feelings of anguish and loss, which go much deeper than the social-political satire. In addition to Mr. Pannach, the excellent cast includes Cristine Rose, as the chilly, efficient American executive of the West German record company; Eva Krutina, as Klaus's mother, and Sigfrit Steiner, as his father. Chris Menges (''The Killing Fields'') is reponsible for the fine camerawork, including, I assume, that for some totally irrelevant flashbacks and dream sequences.''Singing the Blues in Red'' is straightforward and practical. It doesn't need these poetic flourishes.

"Film: 'Ironweed,' From Hector Babenco - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from December 18, 1987, Section C, Page 24Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. EARLY in his novel ''Ironweed,'' William Kennedy describes a visit made to a cemetery by the aging derelict Francis Phelan, whose mother and father and infant son are buried there. It is Halloween, and they are watching him, interested and bemused, from beyond the grave. The infant Gerald, who was 13 days old when his father accidentally dropped him 22 years earlier, is a particularly piquant figure, and Mr. Kennedy describes him this way: ''Gerald's grave trembled with superb possibility. Denied speech in life, having died with only monosyllabic goos and gahs in his vocabulary, Gerald possessed the gift of tongues in death. His ability to communicate and to understand was at the genius level among the dead. He could speak with any resident adult in any language, but more notable was his ability to understand the chattery squirrels and chipmunks, the silent signals of the ants and beetles, and the slithy semaphores of the slugs and worms that moved above and through his earth. . . .''Gerald rested in his infantile sublimity, exuding a high gloss induced by early death, his skin a radiant white-gold, his nails a silvery gray, his clusters of curls and large eyes perfectly matched in gleaming ebony. Swaddled in his grave, he was beyond capture by visual or verbal artistry. He was neither beautiful nor perfect to the beholder but rather an ineffably fabulous presence whose like was not to be found anywhere in the cemetery, and it abounded with dead innocents.''Beautiful as this passage is, and as richly phantasmagorial, it comes as close to being entirely unfilmable as anything one might imagine. The same is largely true for the rest of Mr. Kennedy's book, so much of which takes place inside the mind of Francis Phelan or in the past. The superficial action of Mr. Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Ironweed'' is quite straightforward: in the autumn of 1938, Francis roams the streets of Albany, ekeing out his present-day existence and trying to come to terms with his past. They are exemplifed, respectively, by his fellow derelict and longtime companion Helen and his wife, Annie, whom he abandoned after the baby died but must make his peace with now. Throughout the several days that the novel spans, Francis is also visited by a full panoply of ghosts. But the real story of the film ''Ironweed,'' which opens today at Loews Tower East, isn't the one that's on the screen. It's the tale of how Hector Babenco, the director, captured the harshness and pathos of life among Brazilian street urchins in ''Pixote,'' made the brilliant ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' on a shoestring, and thus earned his chance to play for big and, as it turns out, crippling stakes. For despite its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time, its superstar cast and its $23 million budget, Mr. Babenco's ''Ironweed'' is skeletal, a mere outline of Mr. Kennedy's far more resonant book. That Mr. Kennedy himself adapted the novel to the screen is only further evidence of how much more greatly film and literature diverge than those on either side of the fence often imagine. Though ''Ironweed'' is a bleakly handsome, extremely well-acted film, its virtues are almost beside the point. The initial large question -that of why audiences in the market for a big-budget Christmas film should be drawn to anything as downbeat and actionless as this one - is never even addressed, let alone answered. ''Ironweed'' just is, that's all. It has a stubbornness that's akin to Francis Phelan's, but a good deal less justifiable. As Francis Phelan, Jack Nicholson seems seldom to move, except in flashbacks that show Francis as a younger man. It's a fine performance, very true to the burned-out quality of a man confronting his own failures, but the overall effect is unavoidably glum. Mr. Nicholson makes himself almost unrecognizable at times, behind a grizzled beard and a despairing expression. And he rises to great heights of panic, of guilt and of self-justifying anger as the various ghosts from Francis's past come back - literally, wearing white suits - to haunt him. The performance is persuasive, but it's paralyzed by the absence of many real events in Francis's present-day story. When the film reunites him with his wife (Carroll Baker), son (Michael O'Keefe) and daughter (Diane Venora), the meeting comes too late in the story to have much impact. Besides, this sequence is made to look far too much like something off a greeting card. Meryl Streep, as ever, is uncanny. Miss Streep uses the role of Helen as an opportunity to deliver a stunning impersonation of a darty-eyed, fast-talking woman of the streets, an angry, obdurate woman with great memories and no future. There isn't much more to the film's Helen than this, and indeed the character may go no deeper, but she's a marvel all the same. Behind the runny, red-rimmed eyes, the nervous chatter and the haunted expression, Miss Streep is even more utterly changed than her co-star, and she even sings well. The sequence in which Helen entertains the real and imagined patrons of a barroom with a rendition of ''He's Me Pal'' is a standout. Tom Waits and Jake Dengel are among the actors who play subsidiary derelicts, and it is in these minor characters that the film's Hollywood side really shows. From the real street children of ''Pixote'' to the movie bums who flaunt their down-at-the-heels mannerisms here, Mr. Babenco has surely come too long a way.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.''KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN'' begins with a theatrical-sounding homosexual describing the plot of an old movie (''her petite ankle slips into the perfumed water'') for the benefit of his prison cellmate, a political radical. There is nothing in this seemingly frivolous, beautifully staged opening to betray the film's tremendous reserves of seriousness and passion. Nor are there sufficient clues in the previous film careers of the director, Hector Babenco (the highly praised ''Pixote''), or the two stars, William Hurt and Raul Julia, to anticipate the stature of the work they do here. ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' is a brilliant achievement for all of them, staged with the perfect control and fierce originality that make it one of the best films in a long while. Mr. Hurt won a well-deserved best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival for a performance that is crafty at first, carefully nurtured, and finally stirring in profound, unanticipated ways. What starts out as a campy, facetious catalogue of Hollywood trivia becomes an extraordinarily moving film about manhood, heroism and love. As Luis Molina, the storyteller who keeps his cellmate Valentin Arregui entertained with pulp movie fiction, Mr. Hurt is first seen wrapping a red towel around his head as a turban, the better to impersonate the female star of the film he is describing. The red scarf he ties around his neck in the climactic sequence is both a reminder of his earlier character and a sign of the completeness of his transformation.''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' which opens today at Cinema I, has been adapted by Leonard Schrader from Manuel Puig's unusually structured novel with an imaginativeness that amounts to absolute fidelity. The book, which contains no physical description whatsoever and establishes its characters entirely through what they think and say, intermingles dialogue between the cellmates, footnotes referring obliquely to their psychological makeup, and the lengthy recapitulations of movie plots that punctuate their conversation. All of these things manage somehow to form a seamless narrative, one that has been made even more so on the screen. The initial disparity between Valentin and Molina (as they address one another) becomes a dichotomy between superficiality and seriousness. Molina is quite literally a window dresser who has been jailed for molesting minors, whereas Valentin is a political prisoner. Valentin tells Molina, ''Your life is as trivial as your movies''; Molina replies, ''Unless you have the keys to that door, I will escape in my own way, thank you.'' Mr. Puig typically couches the debate between them in mundane, even homey terms. When Molina offers his cellmate some extra food, Valentin snaps, ''I can't afford to get spoiled.'' Molina argues that one must take what life offers. Valentin replies self-righteously that what life offers him is his cause, and that its nobility makes everything secondary. ''What kind of a cause is that,'' asks the sly Molina, ''a cause that won't let you eat an avocado?''The grace with which the film establishes the growing affection between these two, a fondness that tempers their ideological dispute to the point at which they understand one another completely, is given an element of suspense by the possibility of Molina's treachery. It is this that makes Mr. Hurt's performance so exquisitely poised. When his face sags, sick with fear, during a telephone conversation late in the story, the extent of his earlier artifice becomes visibly apparent. Before that, his Molina is by turns coy, flirty, confessional and entertaining, offering only the tiniest indications of where his true loyalties may lie. His face, for all its quicksilver changes of expression, remains essentially opaque. Only gradually do his actions - this is a film that manages to derive a scene of astonishing tenderness from one character's violent indigestion -begin to override his histrionics. Mr. Hurt also succeeds in making the campy, flamboyant aspects of Molina's homosexuality seem credible and metaphorical in equal measure. If Mr. Hurt has never been so daringly extroverted on the screen before, Mr. Julia has never been so restrained. And they meet halfway in a manner that is electrifying. Their teamwork, choreographed with a relentless, escalating rhythm by Mr. Babenco, never falters, which is made all the more remarkable by the fact that it is frequently interrupted. Several films-within-the-film, illustrating Molina's movie descriptions and starring the Brazilian actress Sonia Braga as a satirically elegant grande dame, serve as refracted images of the main action, couching the larger film's concerns with love and honor in witty, deliberately cliched terms. Mr. Babenco, whose tough, unsparing ''Pixote'' was so impressive, weaves all these elements together in ways that reveal whole new reserves of precision, sophistication and even humor.''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' unfolds slowly at first, building gradually and carefully until its momentum becomes urgent and palpable. From its droll, playful opening to its transcendent coda, it has the mark of greatness from beginning to end.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.''PIXOTE,'' the third feature film by the Argentine-born Brazilian director Hector Babenco, is a finely made, uncompromisingly grim movie about the street boys of Sao Paulo, in particular about Pixote - which, according to the program, translates roughly as ''Peewee.''Pixote looks to be about 60 years old, though he's actually no more than 10 or 11. He may yet be growing, but one can't be sure. Clearly Sao Paulo's slums, backstreets, pinball parlors, whorehouses and reform schools are not providing much nourishment. He is still learning how to snatch purses, roll drunks, deal in dope and murder, but the physical part of him seems permanently fixed in withered puberty. How much of this is a performance and how much is the manner in which Mr. Babenco uses his actor, I've no idea. What is apparent from the beginning of ''Pixote'' to its pathetic end, though, is that Fernando Ramos Da Silva, who plays Pixote, has one of the most eloquent faces ever seen on the screen. It's not actually bruised, but it looks battered. The eyes don't match, as if one eye were attending to immediate events and the other were considering escape routes. It's a face full of life and expression and one that hardly ever smiles. The film will be shown at the Museum of Modern Art today at 6 P. M. and tomorrow at 8:30, concluding the annual New Directors/New Films series sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the museum's department of film. The movie that ''Pixote'' most quickly brings to mind is Luis Bunuel's classic ''Los Olvidados,'' though Mr. Babenco doesn't possess the dark Bunuel humor nor does he attempt to imitate Mr. Bunuel's air of detachment, which has the effect of making credible horrors that are beyond the ken of most of us. Mr. Babenco looks at his juvenile vagrants at eye level, in closeup, as if he were one of them, making no judgments on their behavior, seeing no further into the future than they do, accepting everything that occurs and always being slightly surprised that doomed schemes are doomed to fail. This obviously is the manner of the film, not its substance, which is a mixture of outrage at social conditions and awe that within such lives traces of real humanity are still to be found.''Pixote'' has the conviction of a documentary, though Mr. Babenco adapted the screenplay from a novel by Jose Louzeiro. It records the unsentimental education of Pixote when, in one of the periodic police sweeps, he is packed off to a juvenile detention center where he witnesses rape, blackmail and other forms of intimidation by the other kids, and arbitrary punishment, including murder, by the bored, underpaid and sometimes sadistic attendants. When he finally breaks out of the place, his associates are Lilica (Jorge Juliao), an effeminate boy who is always falling in love with Mr. Wrong; Dito (Gilberto Moura), a macho kid who throws Lilica over for a sick, aging Sao Paulo streetwalker, and Diego (Jose Nilson dos Santos), who is closest in age and disposition to Pixote. Among the characters they meet on the outside are Cristal, a drugdealer with a fancy car and a fondness for young boys, who crazily commissions them to make a drug delivery in Rio de Janeiro, and Sueli (Maria Pera), the worn-out streetwalker for whom they procure and whose customers they occasionally rob. In one of the film's more lighthearted moments (comparatively speaking), the kids hold up one of Suelki's customers, force him into the trunk of his car, which they then drive off to a park where they celebrate by dancing, to music furnished by the car radio turned to top volume, and by becoming exceedingly drunk. No day ever has a tomorrow. The performances are almost too good to be true, but Mr. Da Silva and Miss Pera are splendid. ''Pixote'' is not for the weak of stomach. A lot of the details are tough to take, but it is neither exploitative nor pretentious. Mr. Babenco shows us rock-bottom, and because he is an artist, he makes us believe it as well all of the possibilities that have been lost.

Screen: Story of a Student Filmmaker - The New York Times,"at least at first—that Mr. Black and Mr. Wells have some perspective about their subject. However, it's quickly apparent that they didn't. Tony is a rude, quarrelsome fellow who refuses to knuckle under to Establishment procedure. He turns down a chance to work for a major company, saying they'd probably want him to make movies with plots and characters. Instead, Tony seeks to capture reality on screen by running around town with a hand-held camera, shooting such things as a couple making love in a car, which he then juxtaposes with a shot of a mother trying to revive her drowned child, accompanied by a laugh track. (Just one of the film's many improbabilities is that the other film students take Tony seriously. The ones I know would have booted him out of the hall.)When his girl says that his new script makes no sense, Tony comes back with: ""Does war make sense? Does cancer? Does a freeway smashup?"" Lines like these prompt Melisse to go to bed with Tony: ""He makes me feel alive. He shows me the way things are.""They also create the impression that Mr. Black and Mr. Wells have probably made just the kind of film that Tony would have, had he been given the opportunity by a major studio—plotless and characterless, all right, but loaded with its own clichés of dialogue, attitude and style. The crowning (I assume, unintentional) irony, of course, is that although Tony keeps railing against the studio system, ""Cover Me Babe"" was financed by 20th Century-Fox, which should really know better. The cast is headed by Robert Forster, who wrestled somewhat more successfully with problems of illusion and reality in ""Medium Cool,"" and who seems a little elderly to be entirely convincing as a student filmmaker. Although ""Cover Me Babe"" is a second feature, it looks very much like a first and had it been a novel, instead of a movie, it would have probably stayed in somebody's trunk. The one truth that the movie presents has to do with the terrible economics of moviemaking. Because of the huge investments involved, even mistakes like this can't be allowed the honor of decent obscurity.

The Edge' Begins Run - The New York Times,"and in many ways disturbing—look at the not-so-new-left in ""The Edge,"" his second feature film but his first to receive commercial release. This spare, talky but often provocative film does not focus on the doers, the organizers, but generally on the dropouts from activtism and specifically on one young man. He believes he can become re-engaged only by committing a completely irrational act: He plans to kill the President of the United States. The picture, written and directed by the 27-year-old Mr. Kramer, opened here yesterday at the New Cinema Playhouse, the underground cinema's first-run Manhattan showcase. The theme of the film is stated by the one character in the movie who has not yet been totally neutralized by his frustrations. This young man, a former civil rights worker who is rather half-heartedly planning to organize a campus draft resistance movement, says at one point:""I know there's a war going on and I know it's bad, but I don't know how to take what I believe and make something happen.""That's also the cry of America's would-be-committed middle class, which, intentionally or not, is the group Mr. Kramer is making his film about. His characters—Village intellectuals, artists, sometimes activists and their wives and mistresses—are all comparatively fat cats. Their pads, for the most part, are sleazily typical—sling chairs, lumpy looking beds and cardboard coffee containers for ash trays—but nobody is activated by a need as basic as hunger. Rather, they seem to be anesthetized as much by boredom and their own basic affluence as by the paradoxes of the contemporary war-peace society. This, it seems to me, is the only way to explain the utter lethargy that greets the announcement of one of their friends that he plans to kill the President to atone for the killing in Vietnam. Some attempts are made to talk the assassin out of his plan, and even he agrees that it is senseless. But his friends do nothing to prevent the act, either to save their friend—who seems to have flipped over the edge of sanity—or their own causes, to say nothing of preventing a rather superfluous murder in Washington. Although Mr. Kramer's intellectual approach is oblique, his film style is nothing if not frontal. He snoots in an economical, cinema vérité manner, in the apartments, on the streets, on the highways, on the beaches and in the countryside. His characters talk almost constantly, sometimes on camera, sometimes only on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the latter is often fuzzy, but this has its own authenticity. So does much of the dialogue, even at its most puerile, and the grainy black-and-white photography. The actors, none of whom are well known, do not so much act as appear as the embodiments of various attitudes and positions. Most prominent are Jack Rader, as the ill-fated assassin, destined, of course, to fail; Tom Griffin, as the young man who continues, doggedly, to work as an organizer, and Paul Hultberg, as the comparatively settled—he has wife and child—guru of this cell of lost revolutionists.""The Edge"" is not poetic. Rather it is noteworthy as one of the few examples of underground cinema totally committed to the social-political scene.

Disney's 'Babes in Toyland' Is Holiday Show at Music Hall - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from December 15, 1961, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

ONLY a misanthrope would glower at ""Babes In Toyland,"" which, with the stage show featuring the annual pageant of ""The Nativity,"" was ushered in yesterday as the Music Hall's holiday attractions. Since this officially is the time to be merry, let us say that Walt Disney's packaging of Victor Herbert's indestructible operetta is a glittering color and song and dance-filled bauble artfully designed for the tastes of the sub-teen set. Adults would have to be awfully young in mind to accept these picture-book caperings of the Mother Goose coterie as stirring stuff. This ""Toyland"" is closer to Disneyland, but who ever heard of an adult winning an argument on that issue?Mr. Disney is not setting a precedent, of course. Just about twenty-seven years ago, Stan Laurel and the late Oliver Hardy were having a joyous go at Mr. Herbert's juvenile fantasies. This time, Mr. Disney, true to himself in his own fashion, has constructed a garden of dreams to delight every child, with the aid of a few of the noted Herbert melodies, a spate of new ones, a cast of photogenic kids and willing grown-ups and sets as stylized as those of any Disney cartoon. The librettos of most operettas are rudimentary at best and the juvenile adventures of the lovebirds, Tommy Piper and Mary Contrary, whose happiness is menaced by Barnaby, a villain who is hard to hiss, is hardly an improvement on the standard. But the screen play and the new lyrics by Mel Leven are current and have a jazz beat. And the choreography by Tommy Mahoney gives the dancers in the opening ballet and a gypsy number opportunities to be sprightly and gay enough to charm even the Music Hall's own Rockettes and Corps de Ballet. What the scenarists and Jack Donohue, the director, who keeps his happy company moving at a brisk clip, have done to the original is not of great moment. Closest to the memory is a fine lampoon as that dark, sneering, silk-hatted dastard, Ray Bolger, portraying Barnaby, woos the timorous Mary Contrary (Annette Funicello) with an agile tango-cha-cha dance and song titled, ""Castle in Spain."" Mr. Bolger is the most likable louse we've seen in years. And, a youngster, Ann Jilliann, as Bo Peep, does a cute job of a song titled, ""My Sheep Are Gone"" in a voice silvery enough to grace any choir. Unfortunately, Tommy Sands and Miss Funicello are rarely a spirited pair and though they have several Herbert ballads to croon, only one, ""Just a Whisper Away,"" seemed to have caught the sweetness of the moment. As the Toymaker, Ed Wynn is properly cast and properly the benign, lisping fumbler, whose eager assistant. Tommy Kirk, is ready with inventions that make toys that explode and a gun that diminishes things and people. What with those wacky connivers, the comically mute Gene Sheldon and the gross Henry Calvin, gumming matters up for the treacherous Mr. Bolger, it is not too long before Tommy and they are made midgets and our youthful hero enlists the aid of the toy soldiers, tanks, airplanes and popguns to attack and destroy their tormentor. It makes for a fast and comic display and it is the occasion for the boys to come up with ""Toyland"" and the ""March of the Toys."" Here it is proved once more that these remain the perennial Herbert favorites, despite ""Castle in Spain"" and other of the maestro's tunes. Mr. Disney is guilty, once again, of being a mite ominous to youngsters in an eerie but imaginative ""Forest of No Return"" number and Mr. Wynn points up the film's major fault when he wistfully says, ""I'm trying to liven things up with a little humor."" But this, as has been noted, are the gripes of an adult curmudgeon. With a climax as colorful, busy and cheerful as a Grandma Moses winter scene, this ""Toyland"" should be a Christmas joy to every moppet everywhere. The stage show features ""The Nativity"" pageant with Mary Jennings as soloist; the Corps de Ballet; Lilly Yokoi; the Wazzans; the Rockettes and the Choraleers.

Screen: Bardot Clothed:' Babette Goes to War' Opens at the Paris - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from June 8, 1960, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""BABETTE GOES TO WAR,"" starring Brigitte Bardot, has the anomalous distinction of being occasionally farcical and somewhat incomprehensible. Its French and German dialogue is made lucid by literal subtitles, and the English spoken in this Eastmancolor import, clipped though it may be, needs no footnotes. But Mlle. Bardot is clothed almost as abundantly as an Eskimo most of the way through this World War II spoof, which landed at the Paris Theatre yesterday. And a fully dressed Mlle. Bardot is downright confusing. It is a matter of record that the insouciant ""B. B."" worked hard in a series of airy adventures to reveal her appeal to countless Frenchmen and red-blooded Americans. A switch such as this one could lead to disaster. The fact is that in ""Babette"" the efforts of the three scenarists and the story provided by Producer Raoul J. Levy and Gerard Oury are as flimsy and transparent as Mlle. Bardot's wardrobe in previous films. Suffice it to say all concerned pitch in with a will to indicate a proper tongue-in-cheek attitude. Mlle. Bardot is pictured as an ingenuous country maid, fleeing from the advancing Nazis, who lands first in a brothel that is being evacuated and then, by a succession of events, in London, where, wide-eyed with wonder and love for a young French officer, she is assigned with him to a mission back in France. The idea, you see, is that Mlle. Bardot bears an amazing resemblance to a former girl friend of a Nazi general who is said to be planning the invasion of England. Capturing him would stall the plan, etc., etc. Naturally, the scheme works, even if the plot is somewhat rickety. However, the troupe involved does manage to rib their erstwhile conquerors with a few funny innuendoes and some obvious gimmicks. Mlle. Bardot sending her wireless messages right from a hotel that is the Gestapo headquarters, to the confusion of the mobile tracking units, is good for a couple of mild laughs. The blond Nazi officer who keeps asking our innocent heroine about her brother is a mild dig at the masculinity of some of the Nazis. And the bungling Mlle. Bardot's harebrained liaison with the explosive, fatheaded Gestapo chief garners a fair share of chuckles. For the record, Francis Blanche, as that short, dumpy, myopic and splenetic S. S. officer, is the funniest attribute of the film. Overplaying and mugging outrageously, M. Blanche, nevertheless, is far more comic than most of his material. The versatile M. Blanche, it should be added, is the co-author with Robert Dhéry of Broadway's long-run revue, ""La Plume de Ma Tante.""Jacques Charrier, Mlle. Bardot's husband in private life, is handsome, serious and energetic as the young officer she loves and with whom she effects the capture. Ronald Howard displays some linguistic versatility as the French- and English-speaking British intelligence officer who devises the plan. Christian-Jaque, the director, appears to have allowed Mlle. Bardot some freedom in her characterization. As such, she is, again, the pouting, innocent with a slight, if not entirely memorable, flair for comedy. Her natural endowments are noticeable when she is seen occasionally in a form-fitting frock, but Mlle. Bardot fully clothed is a definite distraction. A word to the wise producers should be sufficient. Watch it! gentlemen. The CastBABETTE GOES TO WAR; screen play by Jean Ferry.

FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; Bloomsbury's Many Kinds Of Love - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from October 13, 1995, Section C, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""The world is rather tiresome, I must say -- everything at sixes and sevens -- ladies in love with buggers, and buggers in love with womanizers, and the price of coal going up too. Where will it all end?"" So wrote Lytton Strachey in the mordantly arch, inexhaustibly witty voice that cast what is arguably the Bloomsbury group's longest shadow, since his influence has been social as well as literary. That influence remains widespread, especially in his native England. The cottages where Strachey exhaustively documented his and his friends' quest for ""a great deal of a great many kinds of love"" have generated a cottage industry that will now leave its mark on the movie screen. Magnified with the publication of Michael Holroyd's landmark biography of Strachey (which first appeared in 1968 and has now been revised and amplified), Strachey's reputation for risk taking has many facets. The least of it is literary, though the irreverence of his ""Eminent Victorians"" shaped a newly debunking attitude for biographers who followed him. (""The tone was officer class,"" said Ian Hamilton. ""The sentiment was other rank."")Strachey's well-dissected romantic life has held an even greater fascination, since this prim, gay intellectual indulged his bohemianism with such absolute freedom -- and spun such an incredibly tangled web. Now Christopher Hampton's ""Carrington,"" which has been in the works for nearly 20 years, captures the essence of the Strachey cachet and brings it elaborately to the screen.""Carrington"" will close this year's varied and rewarding New York Film Festival at 8:30 P. M. on Sunday. Thanks to the character's nonstop bons mots and an expertly clever, wonderfully sympathetic performance by Jonathan Pryce, ""Carrington"" is Strachey's film, even though it is named for the young artist who doted on him lovingly for 17 years. Dora Carrington, who thought her first name ""sentimental"" and permanently dropped it, became the soul mate willing to share Strachey with her own male lovers, even when those lovers complicated the menage by adding extra lovers of their own. She shared Strachey's commitment to such defiantly unconventional living, and she gave him her deepest loyalties, though their bond remained mostly platonic. When Strachey died in 1932 (""If this is dying, then I don't think much of it,"" he said typically), Carrington literally could not live without him.""Carrington"" thus has a relatively untrammeled, foolproof film subject and everything needed for the perfect art-house pedigree. Starting with the indispensable presence of Emma Thompson in the title role, it has such assets as literary interest, sparkling dialogue, droppable famous names (Bertie Russell, or so he's called, and Virginia Woolf), a heroine of interest to feminist historians, grand houses and gardens, exuberant Bloomsbury decor and a continuous art exhibition worked into the narrative. If that's not enough, ""Carrington"" can also boast lovely English landscapes, languid country walks and picnics, and the sly fun of watching Strachey and Carrington juggle each new sexual threat to their delicate balance. For a while these elements succeed in working their magic, doing it well enough to make ""Carrington"" this year's honorary Merchant-Ivory classic. But they also become an embarrassment of riches before ""Carrington"" is through. Audiences now enjoying the radical simplicity of Roger Michell's ""Persuasion,"" which takes such a bracingly different approach to literary film making by ignoring the teacups and baring the characters' souls, may be even more than usually distracted by the kind of ancillary pleasures that give ""Carrington"" its lavishness. Mr. Hampton compounds that problem by letting his film become so cursory and shallow that its last half-hour almost plays like a slide show. Paradoxically, the source of this superficiality is also responsible for much of the film's authentic charm. Not seen in ""Carrington"" are the endless hours Strachey, Carrington et al. devoted to documenting their lives, leaving behind an unusually rich record of every social or sexual development. But Mr. Hampton's screenplay, which is based on Mr. Holroyd's biography, transposes many of these letters and diary entries into conversational dialogue. This approach gives even Strachey's most private moments the polished aspect he chose to show the world. If that denies the film much inner life, it also keeps Mr. Pryce's Strachey steadily delectable with lines like: ""I must say I find those new young people wonderfully refreshing. They have no morals and they never speak. It's an enchanting combination."" Beyond mastering the ideal dry tone for delivering such pronouncements, Mr. Pryce creates a full array of physical Stracheyisms to accompany that voice. In one scene, he even dances in character, mixing fussiness with the sheer glee of being outrageous. Never reducing such flamboyance to caricature, Mr. Pryce conveys Strachey's carefully measured public manner. Ms. Thompson, in a much narrower role, does capture the odd mixture of shyness, self-effacement and flirtatiousness that kept so many lovers within Carrington's orbit and within Strachey's reach. Peering out quizzically from beneath Carrington's bobbed haircut, she is dressed boyishly to suit Carrington's androgyny (though Carrington's involvements with women are more than this genteel film cares to handle). And she turns herself into an uncanny likeness of the woman she plays.""Carrington"" pays very close attention to such visual detail, casting good supporting actors who also resemble their characters a great deal. And in addition to cleverly matching Rufus Sewell to the hot-tempered painter Mark Gertler and Samuel West to Gerald Brenan, two of Carrington's devoted lovers, the film also supplies the appropriate artwork. Carrington's portraits, scattered everywhere to enhance the film's museum appeal, have been ingeniously modified by Jane Gifford to reflect the performers here. Even Carrington's famous picture of a long-bearded, long-fingered Strachey, lying with a book in otherworldly repose, has been subtly changed to resemble Mr. Pryce. It ushers in Strachey's new eminence as a matinee idol, elevated by a biography much more unquestioning than any work of his own.

SOMETIMES we have the feeling that the British, with their manifested skill at suspenseful courtroom drama, could do a respectable job with the problem of a careless motorist getting himself out of a minor traffic charge. Such a feeling came upon us yesterday while watching ""Court Martial"" unfold in characteristic British fashion at the Trans-Lux Fifty-second Street. This trim little Romulus picture, produced by Teddy Baird and directed by Anthony Asquith from the London stage success ""Carrington, V. C.,"" poses a judicial issue of trifling consequence and of no significance whatsoever to the turn of events in the world. A British army officer and gentleman is before a military court on a charge of fraudulently misappropriating £125 of his battalion's funds. Furthermore, he is accused of being away from his barracks on a certain Saturday without leave and of violating a standing order against entertaining women in barracks rooms. The question of whether he committed these minor acts is not even critical, since he himself frankly acknowledges that he lifted the funds for reasonable cause. (It seems he had some back pay coming to him, and there were immediate family bills he had to meet.) He was obviously off post without permission. There was a pretty captain of the Women's Royal Army Corps in his room. And, in any case, the worst penalty he can suffer is dismissal from the service he has adorned. Yet the people who made this picture from Dorothy and Campbell Christie's literate play have stretched it out into a courtroom entertainment that has exciting personal tension and suspense. And they have dressed it up with military details that serve both to fascinate and amuse. What they have brought out of their characters is more absorbing than what happens to them. And how they accomplish this minor magic is more intriguing than the whole problem reviewed. Let's pay respects, first, to the writing. The Christies have done a first-rate job of putting together a drama that traverses the courtroom course in capital style, and John Hunter has cleverly turned it into a flexible and bright screen play. The issue is laid out neatly, the principal characters are smartly introduced and the surprises as to the nature and behavior of individuals are made to pop impressively. Before you know it, the difficulties of the accused man are pretty well clarified as a jealous and tyrannical superior officer and a spoiled and unreliable wife. These become the obvious banes of his professional existence and the cruxes of his success or failure in court. It is in their attitudes toward him (and his toward them) that the excitement occurs. David Niven as the accused man performs his role excellently, conveying with surprising dexterity a sense of professional seriousness and substance as well as personal charm. Margaret Leighton is extraordinarily flaccid, yet treacherous and vicious, as his wife. And Allan Cuthbertson makes the flesh crawl as a cold, metallic, spiteful superior officer. But Mr. Asquith, in his direction, has done equally and obviously as well with his lesser characters and with his whole conception in achieving the fascination of this film. Geoffrey Keen as the senior officer in command of the court-martial gives precisely the tone of British severity and rectitude to the proceedings at hand. Noelle Middleton as the WRAC captain who loves and aids the accused keeps the romantic side in perfect focus. And Victor Maddern as a loyal sergeant is true and droll. With such minor performers as Stuart Saunders as a foot-stomping clerk of the military court and John Glyn-Jones as a snoopy reporter, Mr. Asquith has given his picture fun. And with Maurice Denham, Laurence Naismith, Clive Morton, Michael Bates and Newton Blick as the officer-jurymen he has got the sense of judicial responsibility that makes for a credible court film. Mr. Asquith may not have here an item as strong as ""The Winslow Boy,"" which he put on the screen with sense and meaning, but he has got an entertainment that certainly pulls you in. Also on the program with ""Court Martial"" is a cartoon short called ""Report on Love,"" which gives, in a clever and witty fashion, a quick digest of Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey's famous reports, with a serious overtone of regard for the candor and significance of his research.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. THE casting of Sean Penn as Matthew Poncelet, the convicted murderer on death row in Tim Robbins's quietly courageous drama about capital punishment, reveals a lot about this film's exceptional mettle. Mr. Penn isn't an actor who prompts automatic sympathy. He rarely invites any sympathy at all, and his unrepentant swagger says he wouldn't be caught dead trying. But his natural aloofness is what this role demands, since ""Dead Man Walking"" isn't about the effort to rescue a contrite convict from an unfair fate. It's a hard look at issues raised by the death penalty, and Mr. Penn's lean, mean performance makes those issues come furiously alive. Based on an extraordinarily lucid and affecting memoir by Sister Helen Prejean, a nun from Louisiana, ""Dead Man Walking"" is an account of the author's eye-opening experiences on death row. It concentrates on her relationship with a man accused of taking part in the murders of two teen-agers, who were abducted from a lovers' lane. Mr. Penn's Matthew Poncelet (the characters have been renamed and slightly fictionalized from Sister Helen's version) admits he was present for the killings but says he didn't take part. That's still enough to make him a pariah and, to the parents of the murder victims, even worse. But as a matter of principle, Sister Helen risks opprobrium to become the spiritual adviser to this condemned man. Already, the cards are stacked colossally high against Mr. Robbins's being able to make this material work. The crusading heroine who risks ostracism to do what's right is the stuff of self-righteous issue pictures, and so are some of the sentiments in the early sections of Mr. Robbins's screenplay. ""When you were a child you were always bringing home strays,"" says Sister Helen's mother. ""How can you sit there with that scum?"" the father of one murder victim angrily inquires. And Sister Helen justifies her interest in Poncelet by stating a familiar credo: ""Every person deserves respect.""But ""Dead Man Walking"" is so unmistakably principled that its truisms radiate the religious intensity they have for Sister Helen. As played by Susan Sarandon with an unforced decency to match the book's narrative voice, this is simply a woman who has the courage of her convictions. Sister Helen isn't looking for a crusade, but she finds one after someone asks her to become a pen pal to Poncelet, and after she makes a pilgrimage to Louisiana State Prison to meet him. This sullen, heavy-lidded convict is a hard man to ignore. Affecting a thick Cajun accent and a carefully groomed look suggesting equal degrees of Elvis and Mephistopheles, Mr. Penn gives an astonishing performance and delivers exactly what ""Dead Man Walking"" needs. Nothing about him suggests an innocent victim, but his surliness is so magnetic and mercurial that it holds the viewer's interest. At the same time, Ms. Sarandon takes the kind of risk she took playing a stubbornly obsessed mother in ""Lorenzo's Oil."" She's commandingly blunt, and she avoids cheapening her performance with the wrong kind of compassion. Her Sister Helen is repelled and alarmed by this man, but she's determined to help him anyway. That's what makes the film so unrelenting.""Dead Man Walking"" bears out its heroine's strongest statement of her ideals: ""I'm just trying to follow the example of Jesus, who said every person is worth more than his worst act."" It isn't strictly necessary to share either that belief or the film's fierce opposition to the death penalty to admire its impressive decency. Catapulting past this story's potential for sentimentality, the film explores the moral issues raised by the alliance between nun and convict. Where are the limits of her responsibilities as spiritual adviser? What does she owe to the families of the dead? Can there be reconciliation after such a terrible event? There's an echo of Mr. Penn's own conscience-stricken film ""The Crossing Guard"" in that last question. Mr. Robbins's writing is at times too speechy in tackling these issues, but his direction is graceful and finally devastating. The film moves methodically toward the agonizing conclusion that is its raison d'etre. And as it approaches that point, Mr. Penn's Poncelet undergoes some extraordinarily well-evoked changes, to the point at which the audience must ultimately adopt Sister Helen's view of him. The film's idea of Christian generosity is powerfully here in practice as well as in principle. In addition to another of Mr. Penn's amazing self-transformations and Ms. Sarandon's terrific grit, ""Dead Man Walking"" is directed to overcome the film's obvious physical limitations. Though it isn't easy for Mr. Robbins to sustain visual interest in a nun and a convict who meet only for closely supervised visits, he finds unobtrusive ways of lending variety to their meetings. Mr. Robbins also lets some sparks fly in scenes between Sister Helen and the victims' parents (R. Lee Ermey plays an outraged father, Raymond J. Barry a more complex one) and especially in Poncelet's stiff, excruciating visit with his mother and his brothers. ""Some people are asking me about your funeral, and I get real angry and say 'He's not dead yet,' "" the convict's mother awkwardly tells him. Poncelet is still a tough customer, but he's not tough enough to ignore that. Mournful soundtrack music by Eddie Vedder, Bruce Springsteen, Patti Smith, Johnny Cash and others gives ""Dead Man Walking"" the somber grace notes it deserves.""Dead Man Walking"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, graphic details about executions and flashbacks depicting rape and violence.

IMAX turns touristy with ""Across the Sea of Time,"" the 3-D adventure opening today at Sony Theaters Lincoln Square. As a journey through Manhattan with stops in Central Park, on Broadway and on the subway, it shows off New York's wonders with a World's Fair wholesomeness that is likely to play better out of town. Earlier IMAX ventures have taken audiences to the skies and to the ocean floor, but many of the sights here are readily available only a few blocks from this theater. They seem familiar, even if real-life New York Rollerbladers aren't actually eight stories high. IMAX technology is so grand it would make even the peeling of an onion look exciting, but in this case the format's miraculous potential is underused. Much of ""Across the Sea of Time"" concentrates on antique 3-D photographs, black-and-white stills that offer images of turn-of-the-century immigrants as enormous cutout figures. The process is so effective that specks and grains on these old pictures appear to hang in midair. But IMAX is still most impressive when the camera or its subjects are made cleverly mobile instead of remaining in museum mode. So this film picks up when it takes a Coney Island roller-coaster ride, which really is time to hang onto your hat. Vertiginous viewers should know that the same is true of the helicopter shots of Manhattan skyscrapers. And another nerve-jangling highlight is a breakneck ride through a subway tunnel, even if New York life so easily imitates this particular art. Though ""Across the Sea of Time"" has the tone of a semieducational documentary, it uses a thin and barely convincing narrative to keep it moving. A Russian boy named Tomas (Peter Reznik) arrives at Ellis Island as a stowaway, following in the footsteps of an ancestor named Leopold whose words are heard in voice-over. Armed with Leopold's letters and an antique stereoscope through which he views old 3-D pictures, Tomas wanders through New York searching for the sights that his ancestor saw. Greeted along the way by uniformly pleasant citizens and the occasional juggler or mime, Tomas sees Chinatown (a flaming wok), Little Italy (pizza being tossed) and the Shubert Theater (paparazzi-flanked Donald Trump making a suitably discreet entrance, with the camera also viewing ""Crazy for You"" and its chorus girls). The film's efforts to mix past and present also involve weedy, decrepit versions of once-imposing structures, which contrast strangely with its otherwise sunny mood. As directed by Stephen Low (whose earlier IMAX film, ""The Last Buffalo,"" sounded a few similarly murky notes), ""Across the Sea of Time"" is all a Chamber of Commerce could ask for. It uses both turn-of-the-century tenements and present-day skyscrapers to turn New York into a city of picture-postcard charms. ACROSS THE SEA OF TIME Produced and directed by Stephen Low; written by Andrew Gellis; director of photography, Andrew Kitzanuk; edited by James Lahti; music by John Barry; production designer, Charley Beal; released by Sony Pictures Classics. At the Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, Broadway at 68th Street, Manhattan. Running time: 51 minutes. This film is rated G.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Children are so much smarter than Hollywood gives them credit for being that it seems unlikely many will be fooled into thinking that the world as pictured in ""It Takes Two"" has anything to do with them. This desperately perky variation of ""The Parent Trap"" features the twin television stars Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen as look-alike little girls from opposite sides of the tracks who switch identities. Under the direction of Andy Tennant, the Olsen sisters lay on the icky-poo cuteness with several trowels, often delivering their lines as though they were reciting the alphabet. There's the germ of an amusing comedy in the notion that look-alike 9-year-olds would trade places and play matchmaker for their respective guardians. But ""It Takes Two"" doesn't begin to develop it. Amanda Lemmon (Mary-Kate Olsen), the one from the wrong side of the tracks, is a scrappy tomboy living in the cheeriest orphanage you've ever visited, right in the heart of Manhattan. She is fortunate indeed that her supervisor, Diane Barrows (Kirstie Alley), has all the time in the world to lavish attention on her. Amanda's aristocratic look-alike Alyssa Callaway (Ashley Olsen), who attends a snooty English boarding school and speaks in more cultivated tones, is the only daughter of Roger Callaway (Steve Guttenberg), a handsome, carefree, unspoiled billionaire widower. The two girls meet when Amanda attends a summer camp founded by Roger's wife. Their plot to match Roger with Diane is spurred by Roger's planned marriage to Clarice Kensington (Jane Sibbett), a shrill, affected socialite who hates Alyssa at first sight. The girls play so many horrible pranks on the character (who in an earlier era would have been portrayed by Dina Merrill) that the movie might easily have been subtitled ""Get Clarice!""What stops the film cold is the Olsen sisters' inability to make comic hay out of the two girls' class differences. The anemic screenplay by Deborah Dean Davis doesn't help. Had the movie dared to put anything resembling the everyday language of 9-year-old street kids in the mouths of its orphans and elevated Alyssa's diction a little further, their switching of identities could have been a hoot.""It Takes Two"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some mildly off-color jokes. IT TAKES TWODirected by Andy Tennant; written by Deborah Dean Davis; director of photography, Kenneth D.

Alicia Silverstone makes a delectable teen queen in ""Clueless,"" a candy-colored, brightly satirical showcase for her decidedly visual talents. Thus far famous mostly for being famous (mostly in Aerosmith videos), Ms. Silverstone finally gives a film performance that clicks. As a pampered Beverly Hills clotheshorse, she's mostly a one-joke princess, but the joke happens to work. Even if ""Clueless"" runs out of gas before it's over, most of it is as eye-catching and cheery as its star. The director, Amy Heckerling, also finds herself on friendly territory with the worst Californian academic talent this side of Ridgemont High. Surfer burnouts held center stage in that earlier comedy of Ms. Heckerling's, but this time she has gone hilariously upscale. Ms. Silverstone's Cher, a heroine who along with her friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) is ""named after great singers of the past who now do infomercials,"" uses a computer to tell her when her clothes match and doesn't even let it go at that. ""I don't rely on mirrors, so I always take Polaroids,"" Cher confides. The setting is Bronson Alcott High School, which is not this film's only nod to the classics. Some of ""Clueless"" is actually lifted from Jane Austen's ""Emma,"" with Cher a mind-bendingly up-to-date version of the novel's matchmaking minx. Ms. Heckerling (who also wrote the film) deserves extra credit for doing that homework, but some of the modified Austen situations become a little improbable here. That's to be expected when characters who once paid endless polite visits to one another's country houses are now conducting business at the dinner table with their cellular phones.""Clueless"" is best enjoyed as an extended fashion show (kudos to the costume designer, Mona May) peppered with amusing one-liners, most of which Ms. Silverstone gets to deliver. On television violence: ""There's no point in taking it out of shows that need it for entertainment value!"" On Billie Holiday: ""I love him!"" On why she's a virgin: ""You see how picky I am about my shoes, and they only go on my feet!""Despite its literary quasi-pedigree, ""Clueless"" doesn't have much more than these scattered gags to keep it going. Recognizable characters like Cher's serious, disapproving stepbrother (Paul Rudd) or her seemingly hapless protegee (Brittany Murphy) are trotted out dutifully without being given much to do. But it's true that the tirelessly helpful instincts of Austen's Emma have been nicely translated into a contemporary idiom. ""God, this woman is screaming for a makeover!"" Cher decides about a dowdy teacher. ""I'm her only hope.""While Miss Silverstone guides Cher through the witty costume changes that serve as character development, she's backed up by a solid supporting cast. Ms. Dash is especially appealing as Dionne, Cher's true soul mate, who upon finding someone else's hair extension in her boyfriend's car is most offended because the hair is polyester and looks cheap. Dan Hedaya is enjoyably gruff as the father whose litigation practice subsidizes Cher's expensive habit, and who has even bought her a car that she hasn't learned to park. ""What's the point?"" she reasons. ""Everywhere you go, you've got valet.""""Clueless"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild sexual suggestiveness and occasional profanity.

As the heroine, Hannelore Hoger, undergoes her quest, four narrators chime in, including Mr. Kluge, with the cast often droning back in candid-camera style. And what are they saying? We only read the English titles. The garbled, ambiguous phrases seem to be raking over everything—life, death, spirituality, economics, politics, sex and space travel. Everything prompts speculation, from elephants to bedpans. As it ends, an actor stoically looks at the camera and begins outlining the plot of ""Il Trovatore."" That one we know.

About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The first major film to be made in the newly democratic South Africa, ""Cry, the Beloved Country"" carries a heavy sense of its own historic weight. Proclaimed ""a monument to the future"" by no less a figure than Nelson Mandela, the movie, directed by Darrell James Roodt, is an exercise in solemn uplift that is touching despite an atmosphere that at moments becomes stiflingly reverential. In adapting Alan Paton's classic 1948 novel for the screen, Mr. Roodt, the young South African film maker who directed ""Sarafina!,"" and his screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have remained faithful to the hushed, semi-biblical tone of the book, while using the cinematography and music to add a romantic gloss. As the camera drinks in the panoramic South African landscape of mist-shrouded mountains, the music by John Barry, who also scored ""Out of Africa,"" swells with the same loftiness that infused the earlier film with a whiff of nobility. And the mingling of Mr. Barry's European-style music with fragments of Zulu hymns underscores the movie's dream of racial harmony. But while the film, which is set in 1946, has glimpses of South African culture that suggest the mounting racial strife on the eve of apartheid, it is essentially an interior drama. The story traces the fearful odyssey of the Rev. Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones), a Zulu Anglican priest, from his countryside home to Johannesburg. Once in the city, he discovers that his sister Gertrude (Dambisa Kente), with whom he had fallen out of touch, is a prostitute, and that his brother John (Charles S. Dutton) a political agitator, has lost his religious faith. Worse news follows. With the help of Msimangu (Vusi Kunene), a fellow priest, he tracks down his missing son Absalom (Eric Miyeni), who has just killed a man in a botched robbery attempt. The victim, Arthur Jarvis, was a white man who had dedicated his life to helping South African blacks. Arthur was the son of James Jarvis (Richard Harris), a wealthy farmer and white supremacist who lives in the country near Kumalo. Reuniting with Absalom, Kumalo discovers that his son is not a coldblooded criminal but a lost, frightened man who acted out of fear. The young man is nevertheless tried for murder and sentenced to die. From their shared tragedy, the fathers of the killer and his victim eventually forge a deep and healing bond. The screenplay, which uses a sparse voiceover narration by Mr. Jones, sticks so closely to the book that key passages of dialogue are kept entirely intact. And Mr. Jones and Mr. Harris deliver Paton's oratory with a subdued fervor that makes each word count. When Mr. Harris reads a posthumously discovered manuscript in which his son indicts white South Africa for its inhumanity to blacks, the words have the ring of an excoriating sermon. The two central performances in the film, which opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, are strikingly different in style. Mr. Jones's Kumalo is a sad, plodding bulldog of a man rumbling with suppressed thunder as he internalizes the onslaught of bad news, the weight of Job bowing his shoulders. Mr. Harris's Jarvis, alarmingly gaunt with yellowish white hair, trembling lips and an eagle's glare, is flamboyantly volatile, more so than in the book. Beneath the haughty aristocratic facade lies a spoiled, hot-tempered crybaby. The film's turning point comes when Kumalo visits Jarvis and tremblingly reveals himself as the father of the younger Jarvis's killer. As the minister shakes with tears, Jarvis whirls on his heels, stricken, absorbing the shock, then swallowing his fury in a remarkable transformation. In a moment as transcendent as it is risky, the screen erupts with a volcanic emotion that cuts through the prevailing high-minded contemplation. Why risky? Because movies have become so invested in the unleashing of violent emotion and the escalation of hostility, that expressions of restraint, reconciliation and forgiveness can easily be read as corny cop-outs. ""Cry, the Beloved Country"" is not corny, and it doesn't cop out.""Cry, the Beloved Country"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a scene in a brothel and some mild violence. CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY Directed by Darrell James Roodt; written by Ronald Harwood, adapted from the novel by Alan Paton; director of photography, Paul Gilpin; edited by David Heitner; music by John Barry; production designer, David Barkham; produced by Anant Singh; released by Miramax Films.

"THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Alan Paton's 'Cry, the Beloved Country,' With Canada Lee, Opens at Bijou Theatre - The New York Times","a motion picture that exemplifies the novel and redounds to the credit of the screen. Filmed on the broad uplands of Natal, in the slums of Johannesburg and in the London studios of Mr. Korda and played by a wonderful cast, headed by Canada Lee and Charles Carson, this lovely and compassionate work had its American première at the Bijou Theatre last night. Those who have read the novel or saw the musical play, ""Lost in the Stars,"" based upon it, done here in 1949, are aware that the essential characteristic of Mr. Paton's masterful approach to material of angry implications was one of patience and humility. Within the dramatic situation arbitrarily constructed by him—a situation emerging from the chaos of conflict between blacks and whites in the supercharged community of South Africa—there was latent dynamite, ready to burst into melodramatics at the touch of a wrathful pen. But Mr. Paton, through his years of experience with the tormenting problem of race, had proceeded from wrath and frustration to the wisdom that is evidenced in his work. And it is this profundity of wisdom, this discipline of the mind and the easily excited emotions, that most distinctly and gratifyingly marks this pictorially eloquent and faithful rendering of the novel to the screen. Where Mr. Paton limned the aspects of racial segregation in temperate words and brought forth the tragedy of conflict in the spiritual suffering of two men, Mr. Korda has used his cameras to dwell but briefly upon the literal scene of squalor and corruption in South Africa and has caught his drama in personalities. True, the perceptive director has not hesitated to show the miserable living conditions of the blacks in Johannesburg's slums or to indicate frankly the strict enforcement of the South African code of ""Jim Crow."" But he has made evident these aspects only to set his scene, to establish the oppressiveness of the climate, without having his cameras groan. The particular interest of Mr. Korda, working trenchantly from a script prepared by Mr. Paton, is the dark and terrible passage of two men through the valley of grief and distraction into which they are plunged by a mutually calamitous act. One is a simple, God-fearing Negro Anglican priest who comes down from the sturdy hills of Natal to Johannesburg to seek his sister and his missing son, and who arrives too late to save the lost lad from murdering a respected white man. And the other is the father of the white man murdered by the old priest's son—a rigid and bigoted farmer from the same fertile hills of Natal. Out of the shock and bewilderment, the passion and despair, of these two men; out of the purging of their resentments in the obliterating fires of their griefs, and out of the dismal demonstration of the ironies that touch human lives, Mr. Paton and Mr. Korda achieve the illumination of their theme—which is that society may emerge from the darkness of fear and hate when it, too, is shaken and purged by the counterpart of grief. In this illumination, Mr. Korda depends upon the light that is generated in his characters, and no better assist can be imagined than that contributed by Mr. Lee and Mr. Carson. Mr. Lee, the American actor, does a profoundly moving job in capturing the dignity, the fervor and the humility of the old Zulu priest, especially when he is shaken by disillusion and despair. He even conveys the impression of being indigenous to the environment in which he plays. And Mr. Carson is intensely compelling as the stubborn, inarticulate man who acquires understanding through his misery and through the discovered example of the dead son for whom he grieves. In other roles, Joyce Carey is poignant as the farmer's gentle wife, Michael Goodliffe is intense as a reform school warden and Lionel Ngakane is meek as the old priest's son. Sidney Poitier makes evident deep conflicts in the role of a young Negro priest and Geoffrey Keen is quietly authoritative as the head of the mission with which he works. All of the people who play natives are uniformly excellent, conveying in poetic rhythms of voice and body the haunting rhythm of the book. It is difficult to do proper justice to the fine qualities of this film or to the courage and skill of Mr. Korda in transmitting such a difficult and sobering theme.

Richard III, Starring Laurence Olivier, Ralph Richardson, John Gielgud, Claire Bloom; produced and directed by Mr. Olivier, 1956, Embassy Home Entertainment, 138 minutes. $39.95. Laurence Olivier has said that directing Shakespeare on film was the most satisfying aspect of his career. His ''Henry V,'' ''Hamlet'' and ''Richard III'' are all marvelous films, and each also presents a special Olivier view of Shakespeare. Borrowing from Garrick and Colley Cibber, his ''Richard III'' interpolates and shifts scenes, including a prologue in which Richard's brother Edward IV is crowned. This approach gives a historical perspective, while focusing, close-up, on Olivier's bold characterization. When the movie first opened in 1956, it was simultaneously broadcast on American television, and, seen again, it appears to be readily adaptable to the small screen. Olivier's soliloquies are confided directly to the audience.

Does much else matter? The answer to that question, which will come when the receipts at the box office are tallied nationally, will have vast repercussions. If the receipts are not adversely affected, a new era in film distribution may be here or at least just around the corner. If they are adversely affected, the present liaison between the TV and movie industries may be strained. Either way, yesterday's matinee in the home was decidedly an event. Artistically, the showing of ""Richard III"" in multiple media is bound to generate extensive discussion. Did the home viewer actually see ""Richard III"" as Sir Laurence intended?In black-and-white television, the fairest response, perhaps, is to say the viewer certainly missed a lot. Here was one presentation that fairly cried out for the rich hues that a fortunate few were able to see through the infant medium of color television. The contrast between the two video forms was so marked as to make a viewer wonder if the difference between the large-sized theatre version and the TV version was possibly just as great. On that score, further information may be gleaned from Bosley Crowther's review on Page 1 of the unedited, full-sized theatre presentation. On television, the Olivier film was presented from 2:30 to 5:30 P. M. over the National Broadcasting Company's network. The film ran roughly two hours and forty minutes, with the balance of the period going for commercials and commentary by Dr. Frank Baxter, Professor of English Literature at the University of Southern California. No limitation of the home medium could or did obscure the many rewards of ""Richard III""; the film made for an absorbing afternoon. But this is not to say that, on TV, the presentation was entirely satisfying.""Richard III"" requires attentive viewing, and in a number of spots the film is decidedly slow going. And three hours of concentrated looking at a twenty-one-inch screen is a long time. The normal household distractions, such as a ringing telephone or a wriggling child, are also less conducive to complete absorption than the disciplined silence that prevails in a movie house. In the black-and-white version, especially with a fuzzy overcast that seems to accompany monochrome reception of a color transmission, there was a flatness and a noticeable of dimension. The eye needed more to feast upon when the mind was not fully occupied. In particular, the climactic battle scenes seemed very badly shortened on TV and, as a result, were often confusing. In color television, matters were vastly improved. The quality of production was superb, and a viewer had a true sense of pageantry and court grandeur. The addition of color also gave much greater dimension both to the individual characters and to the era of Richard III. Intriguing as the distinctions between media may be, Dr. Baxter perhaps put his finger on the real importance of the telecast. Thanks to television, he noted, more people saw ""Richard III"" yesterday afternoon than had witnessed all the stage productions since Shakespeare's time. Many schools used the television production for a homework assignment, and this morning Shakespeare undoubtedly is a national topic of conversation such as he never was before. Could anything be more exciting?Crosby in 'High Tor'Bing Crosby badly miscast himself in undertaking a filmed musical version of Maxwell Anderson's fantasy, ""High Tor,"" presented on Saturday evening over Channel 2. The motion picture, especially made for television use, was embarrassingly awkward and inept, a dismaying ""quickie"" unworthy of the Old Groaner's time and talents. For those of Mr. Crosby's admirers who ask only that he sing in close-up, there were, perhaps, some satisfying moments. But beyond that, it was a case of a misplaced Bing. To the leading role of Van Van Dorn, the sensitive young idealist whose love of a mountain transcends the ages, Mr. Crosby brought only his characteristically casual and experienced sophistication. It played havoc with the delicate spirit and meaning of the Anderson work. With Mr. Crosby emotionally aloof from the fantasy's pivotal character, the narrative, in turn, became only bewilderingly confused and cold. The highly literal depiction of the Dutch ghost sailor crew and the lovely phantom Dutch girl seemed more a silly musical comedy book than a touching excursion into the purest of make-believe. The poignant scene between the girl of the Sixteen Hundreds and the boy of the Nineteen Hundreds who wished their love could be was bereft of any feeling. Arthur Schwartz wrote the original score and Mr. Anderson the lyrics for the musical film. No doubt, some of their numbers will be showing up on the ""Hit Parade,"" thought it was difficult to tell from their limited hearing on Saturday night. Julie Andrews portrayed Lise, the Dutch girl, and Nancy Olson the real-life fiancée. In the static production, they had little to do. Everett Sloane made what he could of the part of De Witt, but singing is not exactly his forte. Hans Conreid and Lloyd Corrigan extracted moments of comedy as the realtors stranded aloft in the scoop shovel. Studio simulation of the mountain was most limited in terms of space and looked artificial.",http://www.nytimes.com/1956/03/12/archives/tv-another-milestone-debut-of-richard-iii-on-home-screen-is.html

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. There is a reason the terms ""sophomoric"" and ""sophomore slump"" are so common; there is a lot of truth in them, as ""Dead Presidents,"" the ambitious but naive second film by the wildly talented Hughes brothers, suggests. Two years ago, Albert and Allen Hughes, twins who are now all of 24, directed their startling, sharp-eyed tale of street violence, ""Menace II Society."" Though the title ""Dead Presidents"" is slang for the dollars in a climactic robbery scheme, the story is far broader than that. Ranging from 1968 to 1974, it concerns a young man named Anthony who goes from a black neighborhood in the Bronx to the Vietnam War and back again. A period piece, a war story, a coming-of-age tale and an indictment of a society that is brutal on black men and veterans, ""Dead Presidents"" takes on much more than it can handle. It offers a glaring example of what the Hugheses can do well. With their cinematographer, Lisa Rinzler, they position the camera unobtrusively, for maximum effect. They are experts at creating scenes of visceral, exciting action. Yet the film also highlights what they need to learn fast: everything to do with character and dialogue. ""Dead Presidents"" will be shown tomorrow night at 9 and Sunday afternoon at 1:30 P. M. as part of the New York Film Festival, and will open in New York theaters on Wednesday. Larenz Tate, who was the crazed, violent O-Dog in ""Menace II Society,"" plays Anthony as smoothly as this scattershot script allows. A high school senior from a middle-class family that values education, he nonetheless finds himself the driver of a getaway car for a local mentor who runs a pool hall. He has a comic sidekick named Skip (Chris Tucker), given to lines like ""Pimping runs in my family."" In a scene of comic fumbling, Anthony gets his girlfriend pregnant. Then, for reasons no more lucid than his desire to be different, he becomes a marine. Even for a confused guy, Anthony has a background that is incoherent. When Anthony and Skip find themselves in Vietnam, the film becomes more gripping. Though the scenes look wrong (it is no surprise to learn they were shot in Florida), the action plays to the Hugheses' strengths. Even the characters, their fears and ruthlessness writ large by circumstances, make more sense. Anthony decides not to think or feel until he gets back to reality, an attitude he finds impossible to sustain. And their unit includes Cleon, a preacher's son who severs an enemy's head and carries it around as a good luck charm. He is played with convincing weirdness by Bokeem Woodbine, a fine actor yet to appear in a film as good as he deserves. But for long stretches in this two-hour film, the characters talk like parrots. When Anthony returns home in 1973, to his girlfriend and daughter and a job that soon falls out from under him, his girlfriend's activist sister actually says, ""Welcome home and welcome to the revolution.""The Hugheses obviously knew the world and generation of ""Menace II Society"" better than the past of ""Dead Presidents,"" but that is only part of the problem. In ""Menace"" they trusted the audience more, immersing them in a violent world the film explained without condoning. Their lapse into youthful sincerity and didacticism is no improvement. When Anthony, desperate to support his family, concocts a plan to rob a truckload of ""dead presidents,"" the film comes to life again. The images are striking, notably of Anthony and his friends wearing mime-white makeup. This late episode suggests how easily the Hugheses could have made a taut caper movie. It's to their credit that they chose to do something more serious and challenging instead. Like those overreaching sophomore term papers we can all laugh at now, this disappointing film may free the Hughes brothers to move on to fresher, more inspired work.""Dead Presidents"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes much strong language and violence, with hard-to-bear war scenes of mutilated bodies.

About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Since the robust 17th-century picaresque tale is not enjoying any current vogue, the success of ""Restoration"" can be considered a very pleasant surprise. This jaunty period piece owes its puckish cleverness to Rose Tremain's distinctly 20th-century perspective on an array of quaint characters. Miss Tremain's colorfully eccentric 1989 novel (which was short-listed for the Booker Prize in England) tells of Robert Merivel, a perpetually disheveled doctor who becomes King Charles II's medic to the royal dogs. Through a series of frequently humiliating ribald adventures, Merivel sustains both nostalgic quaintness and the haplessness of a thoroughly modern hero. Robert Downey Jr. charmingly inhabits this role in a film directed by Michael Hoffman, whose most relevant classical credit is ""Soapdish."" That film had a taste for anarchic farce and tacitly nutty excess that happens to suit ""Restoration"" very well. One of Mr. Hoffman's most amusing visual achievements here is the bustling court of Charles, who is played delightfully by Sam Neill as a whimsical, imperious fellow with a truly regal sense of free time. The court is a constant hive of activity, whether dabbling in clocks or globes or architectural models or whatever the King's latest fleeting passion. This quirky tale is set in motion by one of the King's more enduring appetites: his lust for Celia Clemence (Polly Walker), a demanding royal mistress who has become a mild nuisance. After the King has admired Merivel's medical skill and made him a courtier, he soon decides to give the young doctor additional responsibilities. Celia would be less of an annoyance to his other consorts, the King reasons, if she were conveniently married. Then she could be available on demand and could otherwise be packed away to a country estate. So Merivel becomes the designated bridegroom. ""I need a man who is far too enamored of women in general to make the mistake of loving one in particular,"" the King warns him. At this, Merivel becomes hopelessly and imprudently smitten with his bride, and no wonder: she arrives for the wedding ceremony riding on a golden float and strumming a mandolin. The film's satirically garish, wildly overblown costume and production design is among its sly marvels. (""I find the decoration here rather disturbing,"" remarks Celia, when Merivel has tarted up their country manor to suit his overweening tastes.) The film's funniest fashion victim is Hugh Grant, who makes a brief but thoroughly hilarious appearance as Finn, the witheringly nasty, velvet-bedecked portraitist who briefly tutors Merivel in the art of painting. He is not the ideal instructor. ""He's a slow painter, Your Majesty, what with all the cherubs,"" Merivel says of Finn.""Restoration"" becomes an array of peculiar, unpredictable contrasts as Merivel's fate moves him abruptly in and out of royal favor. Also in the cast, representing the more austere side of Merivel's life, is David Thewlis as Pearce, the Quaker doctor who urges him not to give up his commitment to serious medicine. The film doesn't easily capture some of the story's wilder mood swings or stranger symbolic gestures. For instance, there's a bizarre early scene in which Pearce and Merivel encounter a healthy patient whose beating heart is exposed, which to Miss Tremain suggests scientific knowledge penetrating the very essence of anatomy. On screen, seen briefly in close-up, it's just a mildly grotesque special effect. Also capering through the enjoyably cluttered ""Restoration"" are Meg Ryan as a madwoman in rags (this is by far the film's shakiest episode) and Ian McKellen in a small but piquant role as Merivel's servant. Serving as brief dramatic backdrops are the bubonic plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of London in 1666. As that may suggest, ""Restoration"" crams in more research and period detail than it can comfortably digest, but its story is not overwhelmed by such overkill. This big, rollicking film has more than enough heart.""Restoration"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity, macabre medical data and occasional bawdy episodes. RESTORATION Directed by Michael Hoffman; written by Rupert Walters, based on the novel by Rose Tremain; director of photography, Oliver Stapleton; edited by Garth Craven; music by James Newton Howard; production designer, Eugenio Zanetti; produced by Cary Brokaw, Andy Paterson and Sarah Ryan Black; released by Miramax Films.

FILM REVIEW;When Adults Go Home To Mom at Thanksgiving - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from November 3, 1995, Section C, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. When Claudia Larson (Holly Hunter) goes from Chicago to Baltimore to visit her family for Thanksgiving, her parents (Charles Durning and Anne Bancroft) are poised at the airport gate, ready to film her arrival with their video camera. ""I can see your roots, Claudia,"" her mother whispers sweetly during the car ride home. The car is marooned in traffic just then, so Claudia peers longingly into a neighboring car. A stranger, apparently another adult child who has just been nabbed by his parents, is mouthing a cry for help.""Float. Just float."" That's how Claudia counsels herself during the course of this visit, but ""Home for the Holidays"" is not about floating. It's about being forced back into the bosom of a family that Claudia, a single mother and newly fired art restorer at a Chicago museum, has obviously gone to great lengths to escape. And escape is impossible, as is clear when Claudia's mother dishes out career advice. Claudia paints like van Gogh, her mother loyally insists. ""So why isn't some man from Japan giving you $63 million for one lousy picture?""As directed by Jodie Foster in a much more frenetic style than that of her ""Little Man Tate,"" ""Home For the Holidays"" has less to do with answering such questions than with surviving them. Staged with such smothering verisimilitude that 64 holiday turkeys were used during production (leftovers were sent to food banks), the film creates a bustling, overbearing family and a set of holiday comic options. (To name just one: the arrival of a crazy aunt, played by Geraldine Chaplin, who brings a 40-year-old secret and an M&M-topped Key lime pie.) With enough wisdom, this could be funny and poignant; with too much nuttiness, it's ""National Lampoon's Thanksgiving."" The spirited but uneven ""Home for the Holidays"" winds up somewhere in between. Ms. Foster and the screenwriter, W. D. Richter, have given this film some peculiar mood swings, so that it starts out zanily and winds down to a wistful note. The latter, fraught with the realizations that have come out of this family reunion, even border on the depressing. (""If I just met you on the street, if you gave me your phone number, I'd throw it away,"" Claudia's least favorite relative winds up telling her. ""We don't have to like each other,"" Claudia answers. ""We're family."")So to offset any possible gloom, ""Home for the Holidays"" adds a sweet but completely farfetched romantic twist to its story. At least that way two of the principals can go home happy. The cast features Robert Downey Jr. as Tommy, Claudia's super-frenetic brother, who becomes a more appealing character when the film finally lets him calm down. Claudia's fond, teasing relationship with this gay brother is one of the better, more believable aspects of a film that overworks its screwball side. Also tenderly well drawn is Claudia's love for her father, played warmly by Mr. Durning. If he seems the sentimentalist of the family, he's also the one who plays ""From the Halls of Montezuma"" on the organ in the living room. Ms. Chaplin appears in a necklace made of Froot Loops and makes herself entertainingly unhinged, even if the film risks wearing out her welcome with a flatulence gag. Ms. Bancroft makes an ingratiating busybody and incidentally shows the camera that she's in the shape she was in when ""The Graduate"" was made. Steve Guttenberg and Cynthia Stevenson are turned cartoonish by their contemptuously drawn yuppie roles. Dylan McDermott lays on loads of charm as Tommy's latest friend, who sets the Larsons to wondering what became of his last one; everyone in the family except Claudia tiptoes around the fact that Tommy is gay. And David Strathairn makes an appearance as a lonely repairman whose crush on Claudia is of long standing. Back home in Chicago, Claire Danes is underused as Claudia's daughter. Though she's seen only briefly, it's obvious that she's the only grown-up in the household she shares with her mother. Displaying a dizziness more mannered than the cool, crisp intelligence she shows in ""Copycat,"" Ms. Hunter still holds together ""Home for the Holidays"" with a sympathetic performance. When Claudia looks around her childhood home (filled with claustrophobic clutter thanks to Andrew McAlpine's lively production design), she asks herself: ""Who are these people? Where did I even come from?"" In ""Home For the Holidays,"" the real point of a family reunion is the chance to ask those questions.""Home for the Holidays"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity and sexual references. HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS Directed by Jodie Foster; written by W. D.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. At the McCann household, preparations are under way for 6-year-old Megan's birthday party. That means purple ribbons, a large ice sculpture and a cake baked in the shape of a Barbie doll's skirt. Then, with no warning, a fiend rings the doorbell and suddenly rapes and murders 17-year-old Julie McCann. Unless you count the ice sculpture, there is no known provocation for this heinous crime. Karen McCann (Sally Field) is caught in traffic while her daughter is killed. She is on her way home from the kind of job that entails wearing pert suits and sipping nonfat caffe latte at her desk. She has just stopped to pick out exactly the right colored balloons for the party, and she is on her car phone with Julie when the crime occurs. Cutting between the assault and the traffic jam, ""Eye for an Eye"" manages to show both Karen's balloons drifting sadly into midair and the baked Barbie doll, now knocked over and stripped of its gown. This rabidly bad revenge movie is directed by John Schlesinger, who made ""Midnight Cowboy,"" ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" and ""Billy Liar"" -- and unfortunately more to the point here, ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" and ""Pacific Heights."" Never in his varied career has Mr. Schlesinger made a film as mean-spirited and empty as this. The sole purpose of ""Eye for an Eye"" is to excite blood lust from the audience after the killer, played by Kiefer Sutherland as a walking smirk, slips through the hands of justice because of the improper handling of a sperm sample. Mr. Schlesinger shamelessly underscores this outrage by including a glimpse of the O. J. Simpson trial.""Eye for an Eye"" has the well-deserved lousy luck to arrive on the heels of ""Dead Man Walking,"" as serious and moving a look at the death penalty as this one is vicious and trite. With revenge and exploitation on its agenda, the film galvanizes Karen into trying to settle scores with her daughter's killer. And in the wake of trailers that compress almost the entire story into two minutes, the full film holds almost no surprises. Mr. Sutherland sports a tank top and tattoos and is treated as the bull in a bullfight. His character, like Karen's, is fundamentally uninteresting and unexplained. But the audience is meant to cheer when the police detective played by Joe Mantegna cries, ""Get out of my city!"" and slugs him in the groin. The screenplay (based on Erika Holzer's novel, and written by Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa, whose script for ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" was better) adds insult to injury by naming him Robert Doob. Although the film includes several black characters and isn't overtly racist, it comes dangerously close to that by laying on the rap and Latino music when Karen begins following Doob to his ethnically mixed part of town. Mr. Schlesinger's quick glimpses of that urban area do have a lot more verve than the film's completely antiseptic suburb. Ms. Field slips through these scenes in mufti, wearing a Lakers cap and crouching behind the wheel of a conspicuous Volvo. Otherwise, asked to register righteous indignation, she turns red with apoplexy and goes through the roof. So will audiences subjected to the film's one creative flourish, a nutty subplot about a support group for families of murder victims that is actually a secret nest of vigilantism. Ms. Field is extremely farfetched as a new recruit. Also in ""Eye for an Eye"" are Charlayne Woodard as the group member who improbably befriends Karen (thus giving the film an excuse for a gym workout, along with Ms. Field's two shower scenes) and an uncharacteristically bland Ed Harris as Mack McCann, Karen's husband. Scenes in which Mack is surprised by Karen's new sexual aggressiveness, and by the fact that she has been taking target-practice sessions at lunchtime, are among those moments prompting unintended hoots.""Eye for an Eye"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.''CHUCK NORRIS doesn't need a weapon ... he is a weapon!'' That's the ad copy for ''An Eye for an Eye,'' and it certainly is catchy - but it gives a slight misimpression. Mr. Norris, star of such martial-arts movies as ''The Octagon'' and this one, isn't as savage as that line makes him sound. He has fluffy blond hair, performs his stunts in chinos and a down vest, and looks less like a killer than a good-natured golf pro. Why doesn't he need a weapon, when everyone else in this movie is armed with knives and pistols and machine guns? Because he's good at ducking, that's why. One of Mr. Norris's best tricks is hunkering out of the way of a bullet, then delivering an immediate swift kick to his opponent's jaw. He also does a mean somersault and likes to take on his enemies 20 at a time. But ''An Eye for an Eye,'' though it includes a couple of nasty murders to send Mr. Norris on his vengeful way, isn't as vicious as the ads make it sound. As martial-arts movies go, it's pretty tame. As movies of any other sort go, tame is putting it nicely. In ''An Eye for an Eye,'' which opens today at Loews State and other theaters, Mr. Norris plays Sean Kane, a cop who sees his partner shot, crushed and burned in the film's first few minutes. This would seem to sound promising, at least for the serious bloodshed crowd. But it turns out to be the big, important murder of the movie, and its impact is never equaled. Soon the dead man's girlfriend is also killed, and these two murders give Sean Kane many bad dreams (and give the director, Steve Carver, a chance to replay the footage over and over).''Hey, we're really sorry about Dave,'' says a fellow cop. But that isn't good enough - and neither is any other line in the screenplay, which is by William Gray and James Bruner. Since Sean, in his search for the drug peddlers who killed Dave and his beautiful girlfriend, Linda, happens to meet and fall for one of Linda's friends, the story finds time for a love scene indicative of the script's wit and polish. Heather (Maggie Cooper), a very smug and self-satisfied young woman, is over at Sean's house for dinner. He pours some wine, she compliments him on his cooking. And then:Sean: ''Something wrong?'' Heather: ''No, just idle speculation, wondering who you are.'' Sean: ''Just an out-of-work cop with a score to settle.'' Heather: ''What about when it's settled. What then?'' Sean: ''I don't know. Got any ideas?'' Heather: ''Maybe.'' These overtures by the disagreeable Heather mark the movie's single best occasion for Mr. Norris to practice his ducking. Fortunately, he avoids her well, and spends most of his time with either Mako, as his aging martial-arts instructor, or Christopher Lee, as -talk about inspired casting! - an elegant villain. There is also an appearance by someone called Prof. Toru Tanaka, in a role listed only as Giant. Mr. Tanaka is twice as big as Mr. Norris and for a while keeps everyone in the movie genuinely terrified. The final scenes, in which Mr. Norris supposedly vanquishes this fearsome fellow, look every bit as phony as they are.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. ANDRE CAYATTE, the director whose dedication to legal themes has resulted in such outstanding French films as ""Justice Is Done"" and ""We Are All Murderers,"" again is cynically contemplating man-made law in ""An Eye For An Eye,"" which opened at the New Yorker yesterday. This time, M. Cayatte is deliberate to the point of ennui on occasion, but his unrelievedly grim study proves to be an exotically fascinating affair with a starkly surprising dénouement that holds a viewer's attention despite its basically funereal pace. In filming ""An Eye For An Eye"" in Syrian deserts and towns, M. Cayatte has captured the raw beauty of an ancient terrain corrugated by time and weather with his color VistaVision cameras. If the color is uneven on occasion, the settings around Damascus bring into sharp relief desolate scenes unchanged since Biblical times. And the story that he adapted in collaboration with Vahe Katcha, the author, and Pierre Bost (""Devil In the Flesh"") is almost as bare as the arid locales. Except for the first half-hour or so where it is illustrated that Curt Jurgens, chief surgeon at a small hospital, refused, while relaxing at home, to help an unknown patient, who subsequently dies as a result of an extra-uterine pregnancy, the film is largely a cat-and-mouse play as the surgeon is circuitously hounded by the deceased woman's husband. M. Cayatte and his associates are not obvious. And they lean heavily on the arm of coincidence. One wonders how Folco Lulli, the designing husband, happens to be in the café where the harassed doctor is trying to avoid his tormentor; how Signor Lulli happens to be involved in an auto accident with the doctor; how he can manage to entice him to a distant village in which there is conveniently an injured Arab. There are other seemingly contrived happenstances, but an indulgent observer can overlook them, since the director's point seems to be to expose the methods of a wily Oriental seeking his own brand of justice without resorting to murder. In this, M. Cayatte succeeds admirably, even though one wonders whether a surgeon steeled by his profession and constant responsibility would be plagued by conscience over an act that could only be construed a misdeed by omission. As has been noted, the pace of ""An Eye For An Eye"" is as unhurried as a camel caravan. But, as Signor Lulli, inexorably and with a minimum of dialogue, leads his thirst-plagued and well-nigh exhausted quarry over rocky gullies and parched mountains, the plot's twists do provide surprises most of the way. And the climax, as the camera rises high over the parched land to reveal the two principals, one wounded, the other staggering toward Damascus, is worthy of O. Henry and fits the film's title. Herr Jurgens is, despite the reasoning of the scenarists, a tough man softened by doubts. And he does show changes of feeling that seem consistent with the facts as presented here. Signor Lulli's portrayal of the bulky, taciturn schemer also is believable within the context of the script. A widower obviously governed by age-old laws, he will not raise his hand in anger but callously contrives to lead the doctor to self-destruction, despite medico's explanation of the fatality of ectopic pregnancy. The English subtitles literally translate the French, if not the Arabic, dialogue. But ""An Eye For An Eye"" is not dependent on talk as much as it is on M. Cayatte's view of the law. It's a terribly somber view minus romance or happiness. It makes for a serious, professional drama of limited appeal.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Maybe there are strong souls who don't quake at the prospect of Richard Dreyfuss in a latter-day ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Maybe not. Mr. Dreyfuss's taste for grandstanding could easily sink a tale of simple virtues, especially one about a music teacher who is often seen marching, dancing, conducting or otherwise registering emotions aimed at the bleacher seats. But in ""Mr. Holland's Opus,"" Mr. Dreyfuss gives a warm and really touching performance. He's firmly in control of the film's comic moments and just as comfortable delivering the film's calculatingly Capraesque payoff: a good cry. Have we had enough of lovable pedants yet? Michelle Pfeiffer's classroom vamp in ""Dangerous Minds"" looked like the last word in Mr. Chips knockoffs, yet here comes another new version. Well, not exactly new: as in Stephen Herek's ""Mighty Ducks,"" this film feels like a safe composite of familiar scenes and story ideas without taking any great chances of its own. But ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" also steers past each potentially wince-worthy moment with admirable skill. It's disarming in easy, predictable ways that are just about impossible to resist. Without benefit of big thoughts, ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is still a big movie, thanks to a story spanning 30 years and a nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time. It begins as the tale of a young idealist who's forced to take a high school teaching job. As an aspiring composer who has been supporting himself playing at weddings and bar mitzvahs (Mr. Herek and the screenwriter, Patrick Sheane Duncan, deserve thanks for not forcing us to watch this), Glenn Holland (Mr. Dreyfuss) begins teaching with great reluctance. ""I made $32 today,"" says Iris (Glenne Headly), his sweetly devoted wife.""Big deal,"" complains Glenn. ""I made 32 kids sleep with their eyes open.""But it's not long before Mr. Holland, as everyone in the film calls him, begins rising to the occasion. He popularizes music appreciation class with discerning bop-along use of ""Louie, Louie."" He inspires students with the ideals of Disney animation (lots of ""follow your dream"" and ""trust your heart"" advice) even though this is live-action Disney. He battles stuffy colleagues who are alarmed by his irreverence, even though Mr. Holland's ideas aren't much more radical than choosing chocolate pudding over vanilla. As the school principal, Olympia Dukakis has the chance to say, ""Mr. Holland, it has come to my attention that you are teaching the students rock-and-roll!""But here's what helps: Ms. Dukakis delivers her line with a touch of amusement. Mr. Dreyfuss avoids self-righteousness and stays out of high dudgeon. And the script gives him a witty rejoinder to complaints that he is fomenting rebellion among the students. ""Stravinsky was the music of the Russian Revolution, if you really want to talk about a breakdown in discipline,"" he says. The story unfolds episodically, with each sequence underscoring Mr. Holland's valuable role in his community. The film's small-town setting is near Portland, Ore., and Mr. Holland's real opus is a generous life. (That admirable outlook, along with the story's soapy momentum, makes this a worthwhile family film in ways that usually elude post-Capra Hollywood.)Mr. Holland deals ably with challenging students, faculty enemies, his own thwarted dreams and problems within his family. There's even an episode detailing Mr. Holland's Midlife Crisis, with Jean Louisa Kelly as an alluring high school senior who appeals to both his ego and his libido. At a school Gershwin performance, she directs ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" at her teacher with the intensity of ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" a la Marilyn Monroe. Like all the film's big moments, this one occurs in public. A funeral, a parade and many concerts guarantee that nothing major will happen to Mr. Holland without the presence of a crowd. Mr. Herek also jolts the film along with montages of news events and pop songs on the soundtrack, much of which is geared toward yuppie nostalgia. This is a movie in which John Lennon's death proves more upsetting to a father than to his teen-age son. The boy, whose very name -- Coltrane Gershwin Holland -- could have sent audiences racing for the exits, has grown up deaf, which provides the film with yet another subplot. When Mr. Dreyfuss sings Lennon's ""Beautiful Boy"" to Joseph Anderson, who plays his teen-age son, the film makes one of its very few stumbles into sentimental goo.""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity and a few discreet sexual situations. MR.

Crude and chaotic, the movie stridently stands every serious theme and anguished emotion from those two groundbreaking films on its ear.""Don't Be a Menace,"" which opened yesterday, follows the misadventures of two homeboys, the goody-goody Ashtray (Shawn Wayans) and his twisted sidekick Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans). When Ashtray meets Dashiki (Tracey Cherelle Jones), an unmarried mother of seven who has slept with every man in the neighborhood, her children all pipe up in unison, ""Are you my daddy?"" Ashtray loses his virginity with Dashiki on a kitchen floor after a ritual involving half a refrigerator's worth of goodies poured over each other's bodies and slurped up. The instant they finish making love, Dashiki announces that she is pregnant. The movie's funniest character is Loc Dog's gray-haired grandmother, a pot-smoking, gun-toting, obscenity-slinging old woman who in the film's most frantic scene disrupts a church service with a flailing breakdance. In the film's most inflammatory comic bit, the suspicious owners of a Korean grocery store trail Ashtray and Loc Dog through the aisles while a white customer casually steals a sack full of items and empties the cash register.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. One if by land and two if by sea are familiar signals. So is a big studio's decision to skip advance press screenings of a major-sounding movie and avoid reviews on opening day. But ""Two if by Sea"" has Sandra Bullock, summery New England scenery and Impressionist art in its favor, not to mention ads that make it look like a cheerful romantic comedy. How bad could it be?Not exactly awful. But not funny, sexy or romantic either, which doesn't leave anything for this inert and oddly confused movie to do. Its star and writer, Denis Leary (who wrote the screenplay with Mike Armstrong), is too much the misanthrope for this lighthearted story, which throws in so much bickering that it begins sounding as sour as ""The Ref."" And in juggling an art theft, a housebreaking gambit, a police chase and a couple's efforts to patch up their faltering relationship, the screenplay takes on more than it can handle. Mr. Leary and a blond Ms. Bullock play Frank and Roz, a crook and a cashier, who have already stolen a painting from Newport, R. I., when the story begins. He calls it a ""paintin' "" and she refers to the artist as ""Henry Matis,"" which is supposed to make them a lovably salt-of-the-earth team. But when they break into a big, unoccupied house on a picturesque nearby island (the film was actually shot in Nova Scotia), they suddenly find themselves thrust into another world. While playing house, they begin longing for a more settled life. Wobbling awkwardly between real and reverse snobbery, the film provides this couple with a rich, full weekend. Quickly befriended by a neighbor, they go sailing and attend a cocktail party, where Frank has fun delivering insults. Roz goes horseback riding with the same suave neighbor (Stephen Dillane), who becomes smitten with her in record time. ""I think you're the sexiest woman I ever met,"" he says.""You don't get out much, do you?"" Ms. Bullock replies. Audiences have long since fallen for Ms. Bullock's delightful ease with such sweetly self-deprecating humor. There's also her ability to be the only woman in American movies to wear bobby pins in her bangs and still look like a major star. Not surprisingly, Ms. Bullock shows off some charm here, but the role is weak, the direction (by Bill Bennett) unflattering and the banter often listlessly flat. Exchanges between Frank and Roz often sound like this: ""Whaddaya lookin' for, a key?"" ""Naw, I'm lookin' for your brain."" Nothing about this will make anyone eager for their reconciliation. Also in ""Two if By Sea"" is Yaphet Kotto as the police detective investigating Frank's heist of ""Odalisque With Red Culottes."" The heist plot goes nowhere, but it does let the film show off likenesses of major paintings to decorative effect. Other notable aspects of the film are a small-town police station that's also a video rental store, and the screenplay's reliance on a surprising number of anti-gay wisecracks. Those jokes aren't funny and almost none of the others are, either.""Two if by Sea"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Sanctimonious earth-watchers with their stern utopian agendas would seem to be ideal sitting ducks for a raucous movie satire with a junk-food heart. When Bud (Pauly Shore) and Doyle (Stephen Baldwin), two hyperactive pals with the manners and attention spans of 2-year-olds, find themselves trapped in an environmentally controlled scientific community, all oozing, guzzling, belching, regurgitating hell should break loose. It doesn't. Bio-Dome"" isn't a 10th as gross as it ought to be. This thoroughly incoherent movie builds to the inevitable scene in which the place is trashed by rampaging students. But beyond the sight of Mr. Shore and Mr. Baldwin cavorting in Carmen-Miranda-goes-to-Hawaii headdresses, the penultimate bacchanal is a dreary fizzle. Every once in a while, ""Bio-Dome,"" the first film directed by Jason Bloom (from a screenplay by Kip Koenig and Scott Marcano), scratches out the beginnings of a joke. Bud and Doyle are so dumb (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels's characters in ""Dumb and Dumber"" are Einsteins by comparison) that they mistake the bio-dome for a mall. When Bud makes a pitch for one of the female scientists in the experiment, he asks her, ""Did it hurt?"" ""Did what hurt?"" she replies. ""When you fell from heaven,"" he says. That's the high end of the movie's verbal humor, which is generally more concerned with flatulence and pent-up body fluids than with courtship rituals, however inane. The core of the movie consists of Mr. Shore and Mr. Baldwin gurgling and grimacing at each other as they happily communicate in their semiprivate language. Also on hand are William Atherton as the bio-dome's demented chief scientist, Joey Adams and Teresa Hill as Bud's and Doyle's airhead girlfriends, and that most infantile of Presidential relatives, Roger Clinton. If ""Bio-Dome"" is inept in almost every respect, it still projects a clear idea of utopia. In the best of all possible worlds, it imagines, the earth is a playpen for gurgling, overgrown, little boy babies of all ages.""Bio-Dome"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Mary Beth Hurt, her hair cropped and a beauty mark added to her left cheek, creates a stirring impression of what Jean Seberg might have looked like had she lived past the age of 40. Playing Seberg, Ms. Hurt is a gamine turned wise with middle age who stands in front of familiar black-and-white film clips from Seberg's early years. As a teen-ager, fresh from Marshalltown, Iowa (which happens to be Ms. Hurt's hometown, too), Seberg won a nationwide talent search and the title role in Otto Preminger's ""Saint Joan."" That 1957 movie was a disaster; Seberg was a star. ""People magazine didn't exist then, but if it did I would have been on the cover,"" says Ms. Hurt as Seberg, looking back on a life in which the Hollywood dream went hideously wrong. ""From the Journals of Jean Seberg"" is Mark Rappaport's smart blend of fiction, biography and sociocultural meditation, wrapped in a smoothly entertaining package. It will be shown at the New York Film Festival tonight at 9. A few years after ""Saint Joan,"" Seberg became a European icon in Jean-Luc Godard's ""Breathless."" That image stuck: the boyish hair, brashness and casually seductive manner. Yet her life quickly unraveled. Her career, marriages and love affairs floundered. She supported the Black Panthers, which led the F. B. I. to spy on her and plot a smear campaign, which it acknowledged after Seberg committed suicide in 1979. But Mr. Rappaport is not interested in biography for its own sake, however fascinating. He successfully depicts Seberg as an emblem of her time and a victim of her celebrity. Ms. Hurt's savvy, sympathetic performance is the key to the film's enticing tone. In the monologue written by Mr. Rappaport (there are no real-life journals), Seberg approaches her past with a knowing, sometimes jaded attitude and a measured voice that resists every impulse to drip irony. Glancing at film clips of herself as Joan of Arc, she asks serenely, ""Who would follow this drum majorette into battle?""Seberg also sees herself as part of a trio of actresses linked to social causes. ""Jane was the Vietnam War, Vanessa was the P. L. O. and I was the Black Panthers,"" she says, before tracing the arcs of Jane Fonda's and Vanessa Redgrave's careers. Roger Vadim turned Ms. Fonda, then his wife, into Barbarella. Romain Gary made a film in which Seberg, then his wife, played a frigid nymphomaniac. The fictional Seberg wonders: What's with these husbands? And why did the wives agree?Mr. Rappaport raises provocative and sometimes amusing questions about screen images and social responsibility. But in this work composed of dozens of gracefully blended movie clips, he is less successful at examining the language of screen images. Whatever its small flaws, though, ""From the Journals of Jean Seberg"" glistens with wit, understanding and rich ideas. Also on the program is ""Joy Street,"" a vivid, intriguing 24-minute animated film by Suzan Pitt. A depressed woman is shown in languorous shapes and gray tones. It seems odd that she has a cheerful ashtray with a mouselike creature attached. It is even more bizarre when the mouse comes to life and rescues the woman, literally crying her a river of pale green tears and carrying her off to a rich, vibrantly colored rain forest.

Man of the Year - Robin Williams - Movies - Review - The New York Times,"the late 1990’s — when its cynical paranoia could feel fresh and pointed rather than one more voice in a weary chorus. “Man of the Year” wants to plant itself in the noise and fury of the present, but without raising any hackles. Its hero, Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), is a comedian who is the host of a popular television talk show. His name is frequently mentioned in the same breath as real-life models like Bill Maher and Jon Stewart. Tom’s shtick, however, is the familiar rapid-fire Robin Williams free association, more silly than stinging and more likely to titillate with sexual naughtiness than to provoke with topical insight. Like Chris Rock’s character in the similar (and similarly disappointing) “Head of State,” Tom is meant to be honest and fearless, offering a welcome antidote to the usual timid, hypocritical candidate-speak. He serves up some pretty shocking stuff, boldly coming out in favor of environmental protection and improved education, while pointing out that politics is dominated by “special interests,” that Americans are sick of bitter partisanship, and that you can’t tell the two major parties apart anyway. It would be impolitic of me to point out that, actually, you can. But Hollywood may be the last place in America where the dream of a nonideological consensus survives, if only in the form of commercial anxiety about alienating potential ticket buyers. And it is true that neither Republicans nor Democrats will find much to take offense at in “Man of the Year,” though for precisely that reason neither group will find much to respond to either. Unlike the television satirists whose cachet he tries to bogart, Tom is careful never to address the actual issues that provide the content and context of contemporary political argument. Instead the movie is all about process: about the machinery of celebrity and also about voting machines. As Tom makes his improbable, impetuous way down the presidential campaign trail (facing a bland Democratic incumbent and an equally generic Republican challenger), a second plot unfolds at a company called Delacroy, which has a lucrative franchise in computerized voting systems. Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), a Delacroy employee, attempts to alert her bosses to a glitch in the software, and for her pains is stalked, defamed, harassed and lectured by Jeff Goldblum, who plays the company’s slimy chief lawyer. (Not that the flaw is the result of anything as provocative as a political conspiracy. Just technical difficulties.)The two plots converge in a multigenre pileup that wrecks whatever comic momentum the movie might have had. It swerves from thriller to romantic comedy to farce without much conviction, though you can occasionally salvage a glimmer of amusing possibility. Mr. Williams scores with a few throwaway jokes. Lewis Black (as a writer on Tom’s show) rants and gesticulates and provides a link with the real world of abrasive television humor. Christopher Walken, as Tom’s wise and loyal manager, has a good time, as he always does, pausing in midsentence, raising his eyebrows and defying gravity with his hair. Ms. Linney, bless her, insists on acting, which she is very good at but which is pretty much irrelevant here. After many speeches, “Man of the Year” arrives at the shocking conclusion that maybe the White House is not the best outlet for a professional comedian. I’m glad that argument, at least for now, is settled. “Man of the Year” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It’s a whole lot cleaner than anything you hear from the real world of politics these days. MAN OF THE YEAROpens today nationwide.

Heaven forbid that the centerfold models and beauty contestants who inflame our erotic fantasies turn out not to be who we imagine they are. If they are in fact impostors, what's left to believe in?""Man of the Year,"" Dirk Shafer's mock documentary film about his adventures as a model for Playgirl magazine, gleefully sabotages the notion that sex objects are sacred objects. Displaying one's body for profit is, after all, a mild form of prostitution, and the most successful whores have always been those most adept at playacting. Mr. Shafer, a clean-cut, all-American type from Oklahoma with show business aspirations, let a friend submit his physique photos to Playgirl magazine as a lark and ended up being chosen the publication's 1992 Man of the Year. Suddenly, Mr. Shafer, who is gay, found himself portrayed on the television talk-show circuit as the hunky heterosexual dreamboat of every woman's fantasies. Articulate, witty and flirtatious, he played the role extremely well.""Man of the Year,"" which Mr. Shafer wrote, directed and starred in, is a gently satirical remembrance of a charade that ended when a producer for one show confronted him with his deception and kept him off the program. In blending actual videoclips of his appearances on television with Jenny Jones, Phil Donahue and Joan Rivers with comic re-enactments of Mr. Shafer carrying out his man-of-the-year duties, the movie sustains a tone of vertiginous loopiness. The heart of the movie is a series of interviews, with actors playing everyone from Mr. Shafer's parents (Cal Bartlett and Claudette Sutherland) to the editor of Playgirl (Beth Broderick) to Angela (Mary Stein), a woman from Reno, Nev., who goes on a magazine-sponsored dream date with him. Their night on the town gets off to a less-than-promising start in Mr. Shafer's hotel room, where she discovers his boyfriend, Mike (Michael Ornstein), hiding in the shower. (She is too polite to ask questions.) The lover, understandably, is not amused by the public persona foisted on him -- ""Dirk's roommate.""Playing herself in the movie is Mr. Shafer's best friend, Vivian Paxton, who went on television with him pretending to be his girlfriend. The clips make it clear that Ms. Paxton's impersonation was crucial in Mr. Shafer's being able to carry off his act. Also appearing is Thom Collins, a one-time Playgirl hunk who went on to have a career as a drag performer, billed as ""L. A.'s hottest trans-dancer.""The bogus documentary interviews seem intentionally unspontaneous and overacted. The most colorful character is a Southern stripper named Lady La Flame (Rhonda Dotson) who proclaims herself Dirk's biggest fan, blitzes his 1-900 telephone number with calls and ends up stalking his house in Los Angeles. She is far from pleased when someone in the documentary film crew informs her of Dirk's true sexual orientation.""Man of the Year"" conveys two messages, one frothy, the other sad. As it follows Dirk to an elaborate photo shoot, it demonstrates that centerfold perfection has everything to do with lighting and makeup. From a nice-looking man with a buffed body, Mr. Shafer is transformed into a glowering golden god. This surly deity bears only a distant resemblance to the real person, who is admittedly insecure about his physical attractiveness. On a deeper level, ""Man of the Year"" treats Mr. Shafer's modeling experience as a metaphor for the way society pressures gay people to act straight. After watching Mr. Shafer wriggle uncomfortably inside the role he has agreed to play, it comes as a relief when he finally abandons it.

"'Woman of Year,' With Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, at Music Hall -- 'Design for Scandal' Opens at Capitol - The New York Times","a cheering, delightful combination of tongue—tip wit and smooth romance, a picture of surface brilliance designed unreservedly ""pour le sport"" but with enough of a homely little moral to make it quite comforting in these times. It's as warming as a Manhattan cocktail and as juicy as a porterhouse steak. Since the picture opens on a session of ""Information Please"" heard over a bar, we will here pop a leading question. What are the two current topics most frequently discussed by your average American citizen? Why, war and sports, of course. One is grave and depressing, the other is frivolous and fun. So the very clever authors of this picture, Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin, have let a famous woman writer on international matters and an easy-going New York sports columnist fall in love, get married and then thrash out the comparative importance of their respective jobs. Only one guess as to which wins. Of course, that is the crux by implication. The tangible conflict is along more obvious lines. The wife is so giddily preoccupied with the international situation—always grabbing the transocean telephone, hanging breathless over teletype machines—that her husband, a plain, old-fashioned fellow, can't be sure whether he is married to her or General De Gaulle. Why, their bedroom is even invaded by a Yugoslav refugee on their wedding night. But the blow-off comes when the great lady—the ""outstanding woman of the year""—permits a little Greek boy she has adopted to languish, unmothered and unloved, in their apartment. Then the good old American sports writer stands up on his hind feet; then Mrs. Outstanding Woman discovers what a wife should really be—and she ends by breaking into her husband's kitchen and fixing, or attempting to fix, breakfast for him. A picture more carefully designed to stimulate the emotions and flatter the egos of the average American citizen, man or woman, has seldom been made. It frankly does nothing more than give an old story a significant, contemporary twist. ""Young Man of Manhattan,"" for instance, had pretty much the same background and plot. But it has been written with such charming adroitness—smart dialogue and neatly ranged scenes; it has been directed by George Stevens so smoothly and with such appreciation of character, and it is played so brilliantly by every one, especially Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in the top roles, that it has the freshness of something entirely new. Miss Hepburn was the perfect actress to play this ""Woman of the Year,"" and she does so with authority and feeling. She also projects a surprising warmth which she has not heretofore seemed to possess. But her best scene is the one in which she tries to make breakfast in a terrifying modern kitchen, all thumbs and confusion. Honestly, Mr. Stevens has put her beautifully through some farce hoops. This is certainly a scene over which the ladies are going to gloat. Mr. Tracy is at his top form as the rugged sports columnist—cool, deliberate and sensible—and other very flavorsome performances are given by William Bendix, Dan Tobin, Minor Watson and, briefly, Roscoe Karns. If you are one of those wasters who secretly prefer the sports pages to the Harvard Classics you'll have a great time at this film. And even the fans of Anne O'Hare McCormick and Dorothy Thompson will be thoroughly satisfied.

‘Wild Target’ With Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt - Review - The New York Times,"he has nothing personal against any of them of course — he practices French verb conjugations, part of a program of disciplined self-improvement that seems to have carried him into a comfortable and productive, if solitary, middle age. Maynard’s brisk devotion to his craft is perfectly matched by Bill Nighy, the British actor who plays him. Mr. Nighy has, in small roles, added so much delight to so many not-necessarily-delightful movies — the long list includes “Love Actually,” “The Constant Gardener,” “Pirate Radio” and “Lawless Heart,” to take a few at random — that the chance to see him in a starring role makes “Wild Target” more appealing than it deserves to be. What’s more, Maynard’s foil, bête noire and love interest is played by Emily Blunt, who steals scenes as blithely as her character in this movie steals other people’s stuff. By any reasonable measure the two of them should be enough to turn a glib genre exercise into something irresistible. And yet somehow Mr. Nighy’s scrupulous control and Ms. Blunt’s wild mischief are more likely to make you wish you could see them doing something else, something other than zigzagging through yet another weary exercise in comic mayhem. The director, Jonathan Lynn, has written a lot of British television, some of it good, and directed a few enjoyable movies (notably “My Cousin Vinny”), and he does a reasonably competent job of sustaining the mood of buoyant anarchy and genial soft-heartedness that a movie like “Wild Target” requires. But that mood itself is the problem. The mixture of zaniness and brutality that is the film’s only point seems, well, pointless. And if “Wild Target” feels a bit second-hand, that may be because it is the dutiful remake of a French crime comedy, “Cible Émouvante” from 1993, that was not all that much fresher back then. Maynard — no one uses his first name — is thrown for a loop by Rose (Ms. Blunt), a thief and grifter whose blithe amateurism both infuriates and disarms him. After she pulls off a scam involving the theft and forgery of a Rembrandt painting, one of the wronged parties (not the National Gallery, but rather a sensitive gangster played by Rupert Everett) hires Maynard to do her in. Things become complicated when he stumbles on some competition (Gregor Fisher), on an innocent bystander named Tony (Rupert Grint of the “Harry Potter” movies) and on his own tender, protective impulses toward Rose. How far he will give in to those feelings, and whether she will return them, is the main point of dramatic interest, and Ms. Blunt and Mr. Nighy are nimble enough dancers to carry off this romantic-comedy pas de deux across the narrow boundary between love and hate. But too many other parties insist on cutting in, among them Maynard’s mother (Eileen Atkins) and a rival hit man (Martin Freeman) eager for a chance to become Britain’s next top killer. All of this busyness drains away the film’s charm, turning what might have been a naughty and whimsical frolic into something glib, hectic and sour. The body count is high, but the murders are presented with neither the slapstick of a Blake Edwards “Pink Panther” caper nor the grisly shock of Quentin Tarantino pastiche. Acts of violence occur like punch lines to familiar jokes, bringing tedium rather than surprise. Meanwhile the considerable wit, style, and skill that Mr. Nighy and Ms. Blunt bring to the project are squandered. A thin line separates professionalism from hack work, as Victor Maynard surely knows, and “Wild Target” is on the wrong side of it. “Wild Target” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Sex and violence, discreetly conveyed. WILD TARGETOpens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles. Directed by Jonathan Lynn; written by Lucinda Coxon, based on the film “Cible Émouvante” by Pierre Salvadori; director of photography, David Johnson; edited by Michael Parker; music by Michael Price; production design by Caroline Greville-Morris; costumes by Sheena Napier; produced by Martin Pope and Michael Rose; released by Freestyle Releasing.

Swishing, whooshing, lovingly photographed weaponry. Nasty gurgles from the wounded. The clonking sound of a head hitting wrought iron. A bullet in the eye. These are the cornerstones of ""Hard Target,"" one of this summer's few super-bloodthirsty action films, and the one that actually stood a chance of rising above its genre.""Hard Target"" was an opportunity for both John Woo, the Hong Kong-born action-film director with an ardent cult following, and Jean-Claude Van Damme, the self-appointed Muscles From Brussels, to reach a mainstream audience. ""Hard Target"" had a hard time getting past the Motion Picture Association of America's rating board without an NC-17 rating. But even in this somewhat adulterated form, Mr. Woo's film remains overwhelmingly violent and not always stylish enough to give its excesses the appearance of wit. Not even when its star bites the tail off a rattlesnake and then slugs the snake for good measure. Mr. Woo's obvious gusto and his taste for myth making are readily apparent. But so is his fondness for the slow, lingering death scene coupled with sickening sound effects. Presenting Mr. Van Damme as reverentially as Sergio Leone did the young Clint Eastwood, Mr. Woo displays a real aptitude for malignant mischief, which is this story's stock in trade. Derived from the 1932 film ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" from a story by Richard Connell, ""Hard Target"" tells of wealthy thrill-seekers who pay large sums of money to stalk human prey. Right after it opens vividly with one such hunt-to-the-death, the film presents a perfect B-movie conversation. ""It's like a drug, isn't it -- to bring a man down?"" observes the entrepreneur who arranges this blood sport. ""Was it worth it?"" he asks his client. ""Every nickel,"" the client solemnly replies. The screenplay by Chuck Pfarrer (who appears in this sequence as the ill-fated victim) concentrates most of its creativity on the characters' names, which include Pik Van Cleaf (Arnold Vosloo), Emil Fouchon (Lance Henriksen) and Chance Boudreaux (Mr. Van Damme). The film does have one first-rate rejoinder, when Mr. Henriksen's rich, jaded entrepreneur asks Chance why he insists on spoiling all the fun. ""Poor people get bored, too,"" Chance replies. Speaking of bored, Mr. Van Damme has still not broken the habit of his own blank-faced posturing, although Mr. Woo films him in the most aggrandizing style imaginable. From the first tight close-up of the star's brooding eyes to the loving images of his feet kicking various faces, ""Hard Target"" does what it can to present Mr. Van Damme in a bold new light. Curiously, the film's neo-Peckinpah taste for slow motion gives Mr. Van Damme's stunts a balletic quality that diminishes their spontaneity. It's necessary for Mr. Woo to place his star standing on the seat of a moving motorcycle, for instance, and send him catapulting over the hood of an oncoming van to create the requisite high excitement. Mr. Van Damme's Chance (who is said to have been ""raised in the bayous,"" in this latest on-screen effort to explain his accent) is supposed to be a derelict, which allows Mr. Woo the opportunity for occasional flashes of social commentary. The film's glimpses of the homeless are sharp and unexpectedly substantial, which makes its frivolous ugliness that much more unfortunate. The plot involves Chance's being recruited by long-haired, wide-eyed Natasha Binder (Yancy Butler) to find her father, who is of course well past finding.""Hard Target,"" which is set in New Orleans, also includes a warehouse full of Mardi Gras floats and Wilford Brimley, who rides a horse and tries out a conspicuous Louisiana accent. Clearly, Mr. Woo's sense of humor is as perverse as his other talents.""Hard Target"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It is extremely violent.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. THOUGH the members of the Lloyd family clearly love one another, they get on one another's nerves. They're well-meaning but edgy in everything they do. An expression of affection can suddenly be interpreted as criticism, which prompts immediate apologies. Each is bored by the predictability of the others. At the start of Arthur Penn's ''Target,'' Donna Lloyd (Gayle Hunnicutt) is packing to go off on the escorted, prepaid European vacation that her husband, Walter (Gene Hackman), a prosperous Dallas lumber dealer, doesn't have time for. The afternoon of Donna's departure, their son, Chris (Matt Dillon), a college dropout and would-be stock-car racer, gets back to the house just in time to see his mother off, and to hear her say to Walter with deceptive cheeriness, ''Do me a favor - break through to the kid.''''Target,'' which opens today at the Sutton and other theaters, is all about how Walter does break through to the kid, but it's no ordinary domestic drama. It is, instead, a contemporary spy thriller and, at its heart, the fanciful daydream of any kid who's ever wished that his decent, ordinary, hard-working father - a man who always minds the speed limits when driving - could be less like Dagwood Bumstead and more like Superman. In fact, Walter Lloyd is something of a modern-day Scarlet Pimpernel. Several days after Donna has left, father and son receive word from the tour director that Donna has disappeared, prompting Walter and Chris to hop on the first plane to Paris and an adventure not unlike those that Chris has grown up watching on television. Walter is not so humdrum after all. It turns out that he's a retired Central Intelligence Agency operative - with a past colorful enough to satisfy the most romantic imagination - and that Donna has been kidnapped by one of the deadliest of Walter's former East European adversaries.''Target'' is far more accomplished than anything Chris would have seen on television in the 1970's. However, its narrative shape is so familiar and its automobile chases so spectacularly choreographed that the humanity of the characters, carefully established at the start, gets lost -ground down - by the obligatory mechanics of melodrama. The film, photographed on locations in Texas, France and Germany, looks great. It's also acted with stylish conviction by Mr. Hackman and the key supporting performers. These include, particularly, Josef Sommer, as one of Walter's former C. I. A. associates, and Herbert Berghof, who, as a grief-stricken but still furious old Communist agent, shares with Mr. Hackman the film's most surprising and effective sequence. Victoria Fyodorova, a beautiful Russian actress, makes a most attractive American film debut as an espionage agent Walter loved and lost years before. Once kidnapped, Miss Hunnicutt vanishes for most of the rest of the movie and, because she's so good in those early scenes, she's missed. Mr. Dillon is also good as long as the screenplay, by Howard Berk and Don Petersen, doesn't require him to behave with suicidal implausibility. Mr. Penn (''Four Friends,'' ''Little Big Man,'' ''Alice's Restaurant,'' ''Bonnie and Clyde'') is a director of unusual intelligence and skill. ''Target,'' however, like his ''Night Moves'' - another, essentially conventional genre film - is as often upstaged by that intelligence and skill as it benefits from them.

IT is the dubious premise of ""The Brass Target,"" a film full of dubiety, that Gen. George S. Patton Jr. was assassinated in Germany in 1945 by a motley crew of United States Army officers in an attempt to hide their theft of $250 million in Nazi gold. History says that General Patton died in Germany in 1945 following an automobile accident, but Frederick Nolan, who wrote ""The Algonquin Project,"" this film's source material, has connected various unsolved mysteries to make a wobbly case for his conspiracy theory. As historical speculation goes, it's less interesting than wondering where we might be today if Ford's Theater had been playing ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" that fateful night in 1865, instead of ""Our American Cousin.""Would Lincoln have attended, or might he have said, ""Mary, I just can't sit through it again""?You may elect not to sit through international claptrap like this film, which doesn't measure up even to ""The Cassandra Crossing.""""The Brass Target"" was shot in Germany and (I assume from the landscape) Switzerland, with a cast headed by John Cassavetes, Sophia Loren, Max Von Sydow, Robert Vaughn, George Kennedy, Bruce Davison and Patrick McGoohan, under the direction of John Hough (""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"") from a script by Alvin Boretz. Mr. Cassavetes, as an intelligence officer investigating the theft of the Nazi gold, grimaces a lot, like someone doing anything to stay awake; Miss Loren looks wan; Mr. Von Sydow, Patton's fictitious assassin, looks like a man earning a good salary for a foolish job, and Mr. Kennedy, never a very interesting actor, gives General Patton the personality of a sadistic supervisor at a fat farm. He yells a lot but is immediately forgettable. Mr. Hough does nothing to improve a bad script. Among his problems is not knowing how to end a scene. Mostly someone just walks out of the frame and he cuts to the person remaining for a reaction shot when no reaction is due. Sometimes he tries to incite our interest by jumping into the dialogue from the scene to follow. Sometimes he blows a whistle or rings a bell. He's a man of ideas, all of them poor.""The Brass Target,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a lot of violence, all of it simulated but random in the way of simple-minded movie-making.

Screen: Two Case Histories of Horror Are Joined:Boris Karloff Stars in Gripping 'Targets' Film by Bogdanovich at 46th St. Embassy - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from August 14, 1968, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

The invariable question of today's headlines about the random sniper-murder of innocent people is never answered in ""Targets."" This is the only flaw, and a serious one, in the original and brilliant melodrama that opened yesterday at the 46th Street Embassy Theater. Except on this one count, which simply can't be ignored, this admirably-spun and gripping little movie, whose only ""name"" is Boris Karloff, marks a most auspicious feature debut for young Peter Bogdanovich, a former film writer and historian, who has now taken the plunge, camera in hand. He should never let go. As director, producer and co-writer (with his wife, Polly Platt) of the new Paramount release, Mr. Bogdanovich has nimbly sketched two case histories hinging on horror and joined them together, with an admirable minimum of blood-splattering, for the most grippingly clinical and freezing finale we have seen in ages. A solemn foreword deplores the national laxity of gun-control laws. O. K. Then casually, quietly, the story takes up Mr. Karloff, as a genteel old king of Hollywood shockers and a late-late show idol who wants to call it a day. ""People aren't shocked by paper monsters any more,"" he says. ""This does it."" He shows a headline of a massacre in a supermarket. Paralleling the mild plight of the old actor, beset by some Hollywood sychophants, is the story of a clean-cut lad with a pretty, affectionate wife, two disarming parents and what seems to be an idyllic existence. As played by Tim O'Kelly, he is also an expert marksman with a secret arsenal and an itchy trigger finger. Why? How come? We never get past that fresh, serene countenance. Up to this point, the picture clicks along neatly. With a splendidly supple color camera, some easy, natural dialogue and cleverly juxta-posed footage from old Karloff movies, the two stories merge as real horror sets and Mr. Bogdanovich brings up his own big guns. Almost methodically, the boy shoots his wife, then his mother at home. Mercifully, we are spared the gore, but the terror is there. And it mounts, along with Mr. O'Kelly, as he perches atop a tank and picks off some cars on a crowded freeway. Mercifully again, we view this over the rifle sights. But the slaughter rampage explodes in a drive-in movie theater, where Mr. Karloff is making a personal appearance and where Mr. Bogdanovich, with devastating cunning and restraint, really unleashes the graphic power of suggested horror. Nancy Hsueh, James Brown, Tanya Morgan and the others do well enough on the side-lines, as does Mr. Bogdanovich himself, in the apt role of a film director. But he needn't have looked so glum. Aside from that one burning question, ""Targets"" scores an unnerving bullseye.

Screen: 'Target Zero'; Korean Conflict Story Misses the Mark - The New York Times,"an assortment of studied stereotypes, including three members of a British tank crew, who are also picked up along the way—push through to an isolated outpost where the remnants of their company are supposedly pinned, stopping at frequent intervals to make speeches to one another and eye the blonde. When they finally reach the outpost, they find all the company killed, but their own lieutenant—a devoted company-lover — finds something to take its place. Guess what—or who. Aside from the vague improbability of a courtship being carried on in foxholes, observation outposts and the deck of a moving tank, there are certain little things about this picture that cause it to ring a trifle untrue. One is the stubborn disposition of the characters to spout elaborate talk. Another is the easy, wholesale slaughter of North Koreans with which it is closed. And yet another is the mock heroic acting of Richard Conte, Peggie Castle and all hands. That sanguinary business in Korea was unquestionably grim and wearying. But it certainly was not wearying in the way that it is made to be in this film.

THE SCREEN; A Lincoln Story - The New York Times,"what is called the Night Express from Jersey City, via Philadelphia and Baltimore, to Washington. And in the course of this overnight passage, Mr. Powell has some perilous set-tos with several mysterious persons, all suspected of being in the plot. First there is Adolphe Menjou as a colonel of militia. Then there is Marshall Thompson as a violent young Georgian carrying pistols and a rifle with telescopic sight. As the latter's fiery sister, Paula Raymond is not above suspicion, and Ruby Dee as Miss Raymond's maid doesn't clear herself completely until halfway through the film. Will Geer as a wheezy conductor, Florence Bates as a Boston novelist and Katherine Warren as a dark, mysterious lady are possible suspects, too. After clattering through the night in tedious fashion, with occasional characters dropping by the way, ""The Tall Target"" finally gets to Washington and Mr. Lincoln—in case you're wondering—does not get shot.

"' Target for Tonight,' a Fine Fact Film About the R.A.F., at the Globe -- Comedy at Central - The New York Times","films such as ""London Can Take It"" and ""Christmas Under Fire""—which have conveyed in graphic details a sense of the courage and strength of the British under fire. But no film that they have sent over—and, in fact, no film about this war yet made—has surpassed, or can even equal, the extraordinary British document, ""Target for Tonight,"" which arrived in this country only last week and which went on view at the Globe yesterday. Here is one picture you may be certain no Hollywood production can ever touch, though many may try in the future, at great and elaborate expense. For this one was taken directly in the midst of this war's activity. It was made by the Crown Film Unit under the direction of Harry Watt, with men of the R. A. F., from Air Marshal Sir Richard Peirse down to the lowest mechanic, as its only actors. And it has been made with such fine and intelligent restraint, fashioned so simply and directly and photographed with such artistry that it constitutes both a brilliant motion picture and a splendid tribute to a wonderful bunch of men.""Target For Tonight"" is the authentic story of a bombing raid on Germany—a simple, factual account of how such a raid is planned and how it is executed, from the moment when a reconnoissance plane drops a picture of the target until the following fog-shrouded dawn when the last of the bombers—""F for Freddie""—comes roaring home to its base. It shows the manner in which the Bomber Command lays out its operations, how instructions are transmitted to the squadrons which are to participate, how the plan of attack is ""briefed"" by the men of one particular squadron and then how the crew of one powerful Wellington conducts its appointed task. This is but the structure of the picture. The true, thrilling quality of it lies in the remarkable human detail which Mr. Watt has worked into it—the quiet, efficient way in which each man goes about his job; the interjection of humor which even the grimmest task and danger cannot suppress, and finally the tremendous suspense of the routine bombing attack when we ride with the crew of ""F for Freddie"" and get the feeling of being one of them. Mr. Watt has a fine eye for color, and his camera is used with eloquence. There is not a waste shot in this picture; not one that fails to carry a sharp effect. Of them all, we will mention only one as a token of his sure dramatic sense. The lads of the bomber squadron have donned their flying togs in a small room and then have gone trooping out to board their planes, like prep school boys to play a game. The hubbub and confusion suddenly cease; the room is empty and still. But Mr. Watt holds his camera upon it—on scattered chairs and open locker doors. In that brief moment you feel the lurking fate which these young men have gone to face and a sense of their great but casual courage rushes over you.""Target For Tonight"" is a picture which quickens the pulse and cheers the heart.

‘Sunless Shadows’ Review: A Harsh Look at Iranian Women in Prison - The New York Times,"some were brutally beaten, while others were children when they were forced to marry older men — it’s clear they are victims, too. At times Oskouei hands a camera to the detainees, who hit the record button and look straight into the lens to address their dead abusers, or their mothers, who assisted in the murders. It’s especially wrenching when he plays videos of juvenile prisoners speaking to the incarcerated mothers, who face death sentences with little hope for appeal. In one scene, the detainees have differing assessments on how they should have dealt with their domestic abuse. A teenager yells that “society is to blame!” about child brides; the film underscores how the police are on the side of the male abusers. But the most crushing revelation comes during a visit from an ex-inmate, who verbalizes the larger tragedy at stake when she says life outside of prison is not any better. Sunless ShadowsNot rated. In Persian, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 14 minutes. Watch through virtual cinemas.",http://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/movies/sunless-shadows-review.html
‘Sea of Shadows’ Review: A Suspenseful Story of Saving Porpoises - The New York Times,"a suspenseful, wide-screen drama filled with gunfire, cartels and corruption — is actually shot and edited like one. And that’s a surprise, given that the film comes from National Geographic. Directed by Richard Ladkani, “Sea of Shadows” is concerned with the plight of the vaquita, an endangered porpoise that lives in the Gulf of California, between Baja California and mainland Mexico. The illicit trade for the totoaba, a fish whose swim bladders have been called the “cocaine of the sea” for the high price they fetch in China, has taken a devastating toll on the vaquita, which get caught in nets intended for their more expensive aquatic neighbors. Criminal syndicates are involved in the trafficking, and the fishermen are essentially caught in the economic crossfire. Conservationist measures that restrict fishing keep them at home and cash-poor. And given that there are said to be fewer than two dozen vaquitas left in the wild as of earlier this year, many fisherman have never seen them. We’re told they regard them as ghosts, not real creatures worth protecting. “Sea of Shadows” unfolds on parallel tracks. The journalist Carlos Loret de Mola uses his television platform to pressure law enforcement into cracking down on the totoaba networks. In footage that Ladkani amazingly was able to film, Andrea Crosta, a conservationist and activist, covertly meets with snitches from the supply chain he’s trying to break. (Their faces are obscured and their voices are tweaked.)Dr. Cynthia Smith is part of a team with the counterintuitive notion that saving vaquitas requires moving them from open waters; the goal is to capture them and keep them in captivity, if they’ll tolerate it, until it’s safe to bring them home. Jack Hutton belongs to an organization that pulls up nets and, by night, surveils poachers by drone — an operation that sometimes encounters violence. The plot twists are so spot on that a screenwriter might have rejected them, whether it’s Dr. Smith’s attempt to resuscitate a vaquita who has not taken well to captivity or a man, apparently involved in the swim bladder trade, who tells an undercover operative that “it’s a great money-laundering business, too.” Given how publicly the totoaba trade looks to be conducted, maybe Ladkani’s incredible access isn’t so surprising after all. Sea of ShadowsRated PG-13 for conservationists in the crossfire. In English and Spanish, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 44 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/movies/sea-of-shadows-review.html
"Review: In ‘The Age of Shadows,’ Plot’s Fine, but Action’s Better - The New York Times","pursuing police leap from rooftop to rooftop with coordinated moves that would impress Cirque du Soleil — he travels to China with Hashimoto, a Japanese detective, to thwart a resistance plot to smuggle explosives to Seoul. As Lee, Song Kang-ho (“Snowpiercer”) mines the internal discord as much as the script allows while struggling over his allegiances, whereas Um Tae-goo is a snarly Hashimoto. Mr. Kim’s sympathies lie entirely with his Korean heroes. The Japanese are merely hostile obstacles. Still, Mr. Kim will sacrifice anyone for the sake of a good fight or torture session. A scene on a train, in which the police stalk the rebels before a gun battle erupts, runs more than 20 minutes, all of them tense. A bomb-planting scene, set to Ravel’s “Bolero,” is almost as taut. “The Age of Shadows” might tempt another filmmaker to dwell on issues or delve deeper into its characters’ hearts. Yet, for this director, exposition can’t hold a candle to elegantly staged shootouts. And who can blame him.

"Review: With the Latest ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,’ an Existential Crisis - The New York Times","In 2014’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” the title characters, on meeting the journalist April O’Neil, comment with aggressive enthusiasm on her good looks. They subsequently learn that April cared for them when they were just regular turtles, and, hence, is kind of like a big sister. At that point, a viewer might expect the fellows to stop hitting on her, but this reboot of the whimsical superhero franchise is partially produced by Michael Bay, so, no. In the new movie, April, played again by the attractive, pouty Megan Fox, does not hesitate, in the first 10 minutes, to use her sexuality to extract data from two men. She even concocts a sort of schoolgirl outfit to get close to a target. Apparently, the one note that today’s studio executives will not give to filmmakers is, “Think of the children.”“Out of the Shadows” finds the named-for-Renaissance-artists protagonists contending with both an apocalyptic villain from another dimension and an existential crisis (that is, what does it mean to be normal when you are a mutated superpowered turtle?). This movie is, it happens, easier to sit through than the 2014 film. The 3-D action, overseen by the director Dave Green, is not wholly incoherent. The production values (showcasing new mutants and many gear-heavy extra-dimensional machines undreamed of in any actual engineering philosophy) are ultrashiny. And there are even a couple of amusing, albeit unmemorable, sight gags and one-liners. Will Arnett is back, and game, as April’s unctuous former colleague. Newbies include an amiable Stephen Amell as a hockey-stick-wielding good guy, Tyler Perry as a mad scientist and the great Laura Linney. Ms. Linney plays a police captain, and sometimes smirks as if enjoying a joke nobody in the audience has been let in on, at least not explicitly. “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language, violence and other ways of not thinking of the children.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/03/movies/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-review.html
"Review: ‘Kingdom of Shadows,’ a Documentary on the Drug War in Mexico  - The New York Times","A Hollywood feature like “Sicario” might strive to capture the merciless grip drug cartels have on Mexico, but Bernardo Ruiz’s visceral documentary “Kingdom of Shadows” gives you a frontline glimpse. Three perspectives predominate: those of Sister Consuelo Morales, a Roman Catholic nun seeking answers for families of the “disappeared” (civilians who have vanished because of drug gangs or police corruption); Don Henry Ford Jr., a Texas rancher who served time for smuggling marijuana from Mexico; and the Homeland Security officer Oscar Hagelsieb, a former undercover operative for the Border Patrol. The soft-spoken Mr. Ford explains how poverty and debt led him to smuggling, and expresses anger at the United States’ draconian drug-sentencing laws (which are now shifting). Sister Morales, in the Mexican city of Monterrey, tirelessly comforts and rallies the bereaved, and grills prosecutors after leading a public demonstration of frustration and anger. (The mystery surrounding 43 missing students in Ayotzinapa is only the latest outrage.) Mr. Hagelsieb describes the origins of the Zetas, a onetime military unit that joined the Gulf Cartel before going into business for itself. One sequence visits a “narco-kitchen,” where victims are immolated beyond recognition; another illustrates the Zetas’ grisly penchant for displaying their dead victims in public places. The American demand for drugs, which feeds the cartels, is mentioned, though regrettably not expanded upon. But as a rendering of Mexico’s agonized convulsions, “Kingdom of Shadows” is unforgettable. “Kingdom of Shadows” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for images of suspended corpses.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/movies/review-kingdom-of-shadows-a-documentary-on-the-drug-war-in-mexico.html
"Review: ‘What We Do in the Shadows,’ a Vampire Comedy - The New York Times","a spry 183 — would rather be out on the town. As for the Nosferatu-like Petyr (Ben Fransham), well, no one really expects an 8,000-year-old to do dishes. Set in modern-day Wellington, New Zealand (the exterior of the vamps’ house is the headquarters of Peter Jackson’s production company), this weird and witty spoof filters the routines of the living through the lens of the long dead. For our gang of ghouls, encounters with passing werewolves — whose full-moon preparations are ingeniously telescoped into a hilarious aside — are ultimately less problematic than figuring out how to look good when you have no reflection. Or getting into a hot club without a direct invitation. At heart a dotty look at oldsters struggling to adapt to an unwelcoming modernity, “Shadows” has the bones of an anarchic sitcom. The jokes don’t always land, but the group’s determination to befriend a bewildered techie — without eating him — is strangely touching. Once they’ve learned how to Google pictures of virgins for themselves, though, he’d better watch his back.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/movies/review-what-we-do-in-the-shadows-a-vampire-comedy.html
"‘Shadows From My Past,’ a Holocaust Testimonial - The New York Times","The documentary “Shadows From My Past” grew out of an earlier project in which Gita Weinrauch Kaufman, who directed with her husband, Curt Kaufman (he died in 2011), shared letters from family members, many of whom were killed by the Nazis. As a young girl, Ms. Kaufman escaped Vienna for New York. In “Shadows From My Past,” she returns to Austria to see what has changed. The issue of national atonement is a sprawling topic, one ill served by the film’s unfocused and amateurish presentation. At times, the movie seems less like a full-fledged documentary than like a pitch session. “Will another Holocaust happen again?” Ms. Kaufman says to the camera. “I hope not, but can one ever be sure?”Typo-ridden title cards, off-center framing and unnecessary zooming further undermine the material. The movie doesn’t lack for high-profile subjects, although many of the interviews were conducted years ago. Ms. Kaufman talks to the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, who died in 2005, and President Heinz Fischer of Austria. She presses Kurt Waldheim, the former secretary general of the United Nations, on allegations of war crimes. The topics run from the concrete (the Nazis’ treatment of psychiatric patients) to the abstract (intergenerational guilt). Personal testimony is clearly the heart of the movie. As filmmakers from Claude Lanzmann (“Shoah”) to Steven Spielberg (through his Shoah visual history foundation) have shown us, this is what’s essential to share.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/movies/shadows-from-my-past-a-holocaust-testimonial.html
Johnny Depp Stars in Tim Burton’s ‘Dark Shadows’ - The New York Times,"Stoker’s creation moves around in daylight, too, so this isn’t as revisionist as it may seem — Barnabas also suggests the later-life Michael Jackson. Like Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, the most memorable characters in Mr. Burton and Mr. Depp’s previous seven films together, Barnabas is at once recognizably human and inescapably different from the people around him. Alienation runs in his blood, literally. This sense of detachment remains even after he returns to the now-dilapidated Collins family manse, where, amid the picturesque decay and scattered children’s toys — a nice suburban touch — he meets his living descendants, including the matriarch, Elizabeth (a wonderful Michelle Pfeiffer, loopy and steely); her dissolute brother, Roger (Jonny Lee Miller); her teenage daughter, Carolyn (Chloë Grace Moretz); and Roger’s son, David (Gully McGrath), whose dark looks recall the evil tot in the 1976 horror flick “The Omen.” Barnabas, of course, fits right in with this freak show, even while remaining his own (dead) man. The movie is lightly ornamented with cinematic allusions. At one point David’s shrink, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), replicates the signature Shelley Winters image from “The Night of the Hunter,” while the caretaker, Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley), wields an ax that looks borrowed from Jack Nicholson in “The Shining.” Such sampling never becomes distracting and, with the terrific period songs (Curtis Mayfield, T. Rex, Iggy and the Stooges), gives “Dark Shadows” the feel of a pop-cultural archaeological dig. That makes sense given that Mr. Burton’s film resurrects an old television show that was partly inspired by the 1950s and ’60s vampire flicks produced by the British studio Hammer, which were in turn influenced by decades of fang-ster gore and glory. There is also something of a story, mostly involving Barnabas’s true love, if anyone’s interested, though traditional storytelling has never been Mr. Burton’s specialty or perhaps interest. What counts in his work is the telling, not the tale. He isn’t big on narrative logic, coherence and thrust — see “Mars Attacks!,” an exuberant free-for-all — focusing instead on his imagery, an emphasis that can either bore you to tears, as in his “Alice in Wonderland,” or, as in “Dark Shadows,” pleasantly slow everything down, allowing you to luxuriate in his embroidery and doodling, the paintings on the walls, the gloom in the halls. Although Mr. Burton’s talents can make him seem more like a production designer than a director, in his strongest films his visual style can be thrillingly expressive. “Dark Shadows” isn’t among Mr. Burton’s most richly realized works, but it’s very enjoyable, visually sumptuous and, despite its lugubrious source material and a sporadic tremor of violence, surprisingly effervescent. There has often been something moribund about Mr. Burton’s period efforts, and it may be that he tends to be more at ease, feels aesthetically freer, when he’s having fun with pop culture (his inert redo of “Planet of the Apes” excepted) than adapting high-culture classics. And while there may not be any deeper resonance lurking in his “Dark Shadows” — the show first surfaced in the middle of the Vietnam War, when real horror was playing out daily in the news — Mr. Burton’s gift for deviant beauty and laughter has its own liberating power. “Dark Shadows” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some vampire violence and demonic sex.",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/movies/johnny-depp-stars-in-tim-burtons-dark-shadows.html
‘Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows’ - Review - The New York Times,"the Marvel “Iron Man” proto-“Avengers” thing for Paramount and the brawling steampunk “Sherlock Holmes” series for Warner Brothers — so it is perhaps understandable that he is showing a touch of fatigue. In the new Holmes adventure, “A Game of Shadows,” his imperiousness is hard to distinguish from boredom, and he seems to be in a hurry to spit out his lines, take his lumps, throw his punches and collect his paycheck. Can a movie be hyperactive and lazy at the same time? Clever and idiotic? If the director is Guy Ritchie, the questions answer themselves. Like its predecessor “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” confects a smoky, overcast Victorian world, infuses it with an air of jocular, hairy laddishness and stages a lot of fights in fussy and tiresome slow motion. There is a plot, but no real intrigue, mystery or suspense, and no inkling of anything at stake beyond a childish and belligerent idea of fun. What a shame. Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective, with his violin, his deerstalker and his steel-trap mind, has been one of the most resilient and adaptable figures in Anglophone popular culture. He has been updated, travestied and conscripted into preposterous tales so many times — including by Doyle himself — that it is silly to hold his character sacred, or to scold Mr. Ritchie for taking liberties. But you would think that a man of such reputed brilliance and erudition (I’m talking about Holmes) would at least know how to pronounce the word “heinous” or use “crescendo” properly in a sentence. And you would think that a brewing showdown between Holmes and his nemesis, Moriarty (Jared Harris), would involve intrigue, suspense and devilish plots and counterplots. Not that thinking is in any way relevant. There are a few dabs of sophistication — the witty, walrussy presence of Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s brother; a disquisition on Schubert’s great lieder and a morsel of Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” — but these feel random and perfunctory. The real point of the movie is the bantering byplay between Holmes and Watson (Jude Law) punctuated by punches, explosions and action sequences as bloated and pretentious as a 10-minute drum solo on a live album by a second-rate art-rock band from the ’70s. Rachel McAdams bustles through the action in a bustle; Noomi Rapace lingers a bit longer in long tresses and Gypsy garb. There is not enough of Eddie Marsan and just enough of Mr. Harris, sneering through a ginger beard, to make you root for the Napoleon of Crime against the foppish fool from Baker Street. Who is oddly mopey this time out, as if needing to reassure us of his sensitive, vulnerable side. Poor Sherlock. He is so desperate for attention, so needy — perhaps because of the competition from the likes of Tom Cruise and Tintin — that you are likely to reach the point of exasperation long before Watson does. “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes fisticuffs, explosions, naughty innuendo. SHERLOCK HOLMESA Game of ShadowsOpens on Friday nationwide. Directed by Guy Ritchie; written by Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney, based on characters created by Arthur Conan Doyle; director of photography, Philippe Rousselot; edited by James Herbert; music by Hans Zimmer; production design by Sarah Greenwood; costumes by Jenny Beavan; produced by Joel Silver, Lionel Wigram, Susan Downey and Dan Lin; released by Warner Brothers Pictures.

FILM REVIEW; You Can't Hurry Fame: Motown's Unsung Heroes - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from November 15, 2002, Section E, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.''Forty-one years after they played their first note on a Motown record and three decades since they were all together, the Funk Brothers reunited in Detroit to play their music and tell their story,'' reads a title early in the director Paul Justman's documentary ''Standing in the Shadows of Motown.'' It is a simple premise that this movie more than lives up to, falling back on the serene power of the Funk Brothers, the squadron of elite musicians heard laying down the rhythm -- and the law -- on Motown's greatest hits. This salute to the literally unsung and underrecognized studio heroes of Motown is so good because it is one of those rare documentaries that combine information with smashing entertainment. And it is one of the few nonfiction films that will have you walking out humming the score, if you're not running to the nearest store to buy Motown CD's. The movie, which opens nationwide today, shifts among four components: performers lining up to offer heartfelt but uninvolving tributes to the Funk Brothers; the musicians talking about performances that turned sheet music into legendary recordings; new renditions of Motown classics with the Funk Brothers backing up guest vocalists like Ben Harper; and dramatic re-creations of Funk Brother anecdotes. These dramatizations lack the theatrical timing and phrasing of the Funk Brothers just spinning the tales, which Mr. Justman allows them to do at their own leisurely pace as they explain how the Motown founder, Berry Gordy, hired them. (It's appropriate that Artisan is releasing this film because that is exactly what these musicians are.)Two of the Brothers, the keyboardist Joe Hunter and the vibes and percussionist Jack Ashford, make especially vivid impressions. Speaking in menthol-cool tones that still carry a trace of arrogance, Mr. Ashford talks about his first meeting with Marvin Gaye, in which Mr. Ashford didn't bother to sugar his disdain for pop. ''Everybody wanted to be like Miles Davis, didn't matter what instrument you played,'' he says, explaining his cockiness. The puckish Mr. Hunter, who can't even sit and nod without a mischievous glint in his eyes, speaks so plainly and directly that only afterward does the impact of his words register. He fell in love with Rachmaninoff because ''he had such a terrific left hand,'' he said, adding: ''I wish my left hand could be like that. I'd put my right hand in my pocket and just play with my left.''His fellow pianist Johnny Griffith -- who died on Sunday, and whose unlined, beatific face makes him look easily 20 years younger than the 66 he was -- confides a Hunter direction; he says Mr. Hunter told him: ''Just play what you want to play. They don't know what they listenin' to anyway. If it's too much, they'll let you know.''The beauty of Motown is its simplicity, and straightforward confessions will forever change the way you regard the music. The Motown producer and arranger Paul Riser seconds Mr. Hunter: ''Arrangers would come in and just have a general idea of our concept and we'd leave them with the masters.''Such statements bring to mind Bob Dylan's calling Smokey Robinson America's greatest living poet, and raise the question of whether his poetry would have even existed without the Funk Brothers giving lilt to his lyrics. That truth is divined earlier in ''Motown'' when the drummer Steve Jordan, the linchpin of the original ''Late Night With David Letterman'' band, assesses the Funk Brothers' contributions: ''When these cats cut tracks -- and really, no offense to any of the great artists who sang on them -- Deputy Dawg could've sung on them and they would've been a hit.'' He's right. The grooves in the Motown standards are so solid that even high-school marching bands can't ruin them, so it is a little less than monumental when Gerald Levert, Joan Osborne and Meshell Ndegeocello join the Funk Brothers to sing ''Reach Out, I'll Be There'' or ''Heat Wave'' or ''You Really Got a Hold on Me.''The stories the musicians tell about their lives and work are the center of the picture. These moments make ''Motown'' truly inspiring and mesmerizing film. The beats the Funk Brothers pound out alone are hypnotic, and ''Motown'' falls into the by-now dependable tradition that includes ''Buena Vista Social Club'' and ''Calle 54.'' Like these movies, ''Motown'' is a showcase for the natural charisma of musicians who claim the screen by dint of pride, accomplishment and sheer will. ''Buena Vista'' is the one to be taken the most seriously -- and rightfully so -- because of the political system that its stars had to endure. There are personal politics in ''Motown,'' because the Funk Brothers had to cope with the whims of a genius as wily and autocratic as Fidel Castro and far more unpredictable: the bassist James Jamerson, who is called tortured in the narration by Andre Braugher. The film was inspired by Allan Slutsky's enlightening book on Jamerson from which the movie takes its title: ''Standing in the Shadows of Motown: The Life and Music of Legendary Bassist James Jamerson,'' a combination biography and bass-guitar instruction manual that has to be the most unlikely book in movie history ever to become the root of a great documentary.''Motown'' gives a lot of attention to Jamerson, who deserves his own film. He died in 1983 at age 45. His son, James Jr., talks about how his father, as a boy, would create a makeshift bass out of a stick strung with a rubber band, jam the stick in an ant hole and ''make the ants dance.'' The movie hints that Jamerson's charming eccentricity masked a dangerous streak, which is reinforced when Mr. Ashford remarks, ''You try to keep him as tranquil as possible because he could really get out there.'' (Jamerson's descent into alcoholism and obscurity is given shorter shrift than it deserves; Mr. Justman obviously wanted to keep the story upbeat.)''Standing in the Shadows of Motown'' doesn't seem to have a single poorly told anecdote, and we get a chance to see how well developed a sense of drama the funkateers possess. And speaking of funkateers, one of the guest artists lending his talents to a Motown classic is Bootsy Collins, the P-Funk liquid-toned bassist, who joins the Funk Brothers for ''Do You Love Me?'' -- and who invented the word funkateers. Mr. Collins, who headed the Rubber Band, had his own bass style that was undeniably influenced by Jamerson. (Jamerson's slippery, sinuous bottom-plucking gave Motown its distinctive throb.)Given that all of the musicians in the film labored through the conditions suggested in the title -- though they all emerged from the shade of Motown to emit their own voluminous glows -- it is Jamerson's one-finger plucking, demonstrated by his son, that casts the deepest, most fascinating spell. To be sure, the movie does not stint on spotlighting the talents of other Funk Brothers, now dead, like the drummer Benny Benjamin, known as Papa Zita, the member who named the band the Funk Brothers and is the subject of several funny stories. One minor quibble is that the movie lacks a clarifying touch. No one notes that so much of the transformative artistry of the Funk Brothers' bumping rhythm lines gave muscle to the longest streak of love songs centering on sexual paranoia. Much of the Motown catalog is about fearful romantic obsession; one such gem, ''It's a Desperate Situation,'' was co-written by Mr. Hunter and recorded by Gaye. (It only surfaced a few years ago.) Maybe this movie will compel Motown to rerelease great, forgotten albums like Griffith's solo work. Incidentally, Mr. Collins and his compatriot George Clinton recorded some of the most astounding funk in Detroit, a few miles north of where the Funk Brothers plied their trade. This is not the Detroit of Eminem's biopic, ''8 Mile,'' a blighted wasteland that could be found in Ze'ev Chafets's book ''Devil's Night: And Other True Tales of Detroit.'' Rather, this movie focuses on the optimism that brought the Funk Brothers to Detroit to stake their musical claim. This makes ''Motown'' the perfect companion piece to ''8 Mile,'' because it shows that there is something in the water, or the air, or the ginger ale in Detroit that has made it such a remarkable place. The spirit of adventure rules the day in ''Standing in the Shadows of Motown''; it was a game initiative that made funk an art form.''Standing in the Shadows of Motown'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has strong language.

"FILM REVIEW; Burkittsville Revisited, With More Mind Games - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from October 27, 2000, Section E, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Whether or not it flies at the box office, ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' (the sequel to ''The Blair Witch Project'') can't be written off as a weak, half-hearted effort to eke out a few more dollars from last year's blockbuster cinematic jack-in-the-box. The $10 million follow-up to the Little $30,000 Movie That Could is a clever if muddled collection of riffs on the Blair Witch juggernaut, dressed up with intellectual pretensions by Joe Berlinger, who directed this film with a chortling zest. Once the movie is over and you're sitting around with friends unraveling its inconsistencies (and, oh, how the film's releasing company, Artisan Entertainment, is hoping you will!), don't blame yourself if none of it adds up. The movie is best appreciated as an amusing smart-aleck joke directed at a clued-in cult audience that can't get enough of the original movie's supernatural mind games. How large is that cult audience? This weekend's box-office figures will tell whether last year's Hollywood answer to the pet rock craze can be spun off into a franchise. And speaking of pet rocks, through the Internet you can still buy collections of sticks and stones ostensibly gathered from the Black Hills around Burkittsville, Md., where both movies are set. In the movie, Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan), the sequel's prime mover, has a whole warehouse stocked with Blair Witch bric-a-brac that he markets online. Months before its release, the original ''Blair Witch Project'' tantalized prospective audiences with the remote possibility that the film might be a crude home movie left behind by a group who disappeared without a trace. The opulent sequel (filmed with lots of blazing Halloween oranges) plays similar mind games in a documentary prologue in which actual residents (or are they?) of Burkittsville are interviewed about the impact of the Blair Witch phenomenon on their community. Most are quite grumpy about it. The intellectual kernel of ''Book of Shadows'' is a Marshall McLuhan-esque assertion dropped early in the film by Jeff, who leads a group of four Blair Witch fanatics into those scrubby Black Hills. ''Film lies,'' he declares. ''Video tells the truth.'' At that moment the character becomes a mouthpiece for the director, who bases the story's surprise ending on this dubious premise. Mr. Berlinger may be the ideal director for the project, since his earlier work has demonstrated a singular fascination with the ways filmmaking technology affects our perceptions of reality. His ''Paradise Lost'' documentaries, which investigated murder and religious fanaticism in a small Southern town, were true stories but filmed and edited with a gaudy panache that gave them the look and dramatic structure of fiction. ''Book of Shadows,'' which has a similarly lurid flavor, is a facetious exhibition and critique of technological trickery. Why, the movie wonders, should we trust the reality of a grainy home video more than crisp 35-millimeter images? Is technological crudeness synonymous with imagistic purity?Jeff and his party are far from your average tourists. In a screeching, head-banging, padded-cell flashback, we discover that Jeff has only recently been discharged from a mental institution. Erica (Erica Leerhsen) is a practicing Wiccan incensed by the original movie's portrayal of witchcraft as evil. (Yet in some scenes she appears almost demonically possessed.) Hard-as-nails Kim (Kim Director) is a Goth enthusiast who dresses like Elvira and has strange intuitions that prove unnervingly accurate. The most ''normal'' of the five are Stephen (Stephen Barker Turner) and his pregnant girlfriend, Tristen (Tristen Skyler), graduate students writing a book about the Blair Witch. But they, too, have agendas. Tristen insists that the myth, like so much folklore, must have some basis in fact, while Stephen, a diehard rationalist, is convinced the Blair Witch legend is nothing more than mass hysteria. When the party reaches one of the Blair Witch sites, the five have a nasty run-in with a rival tour, which Jeff sends elsewhere. Once the interlopers have departed, Jeff's group proceeds to have a wild party. The next morning, they are stunned to find all their video equipment destroyed and the tapes of the night's activities buried but intact. And in the first indication that a curse might have been laid on them while they slept, Tristen spontaneously miscarries. The situation quickly worsens. After Tristen has been treated in the hospital, the group returns to Jeff's warehouse and begins playing the videotapes in search of clues. What the tourists discover is a mysterious and frightening time gap. At the same time, they begin having terrifying hallucinations. Although ''Book of Shadows'' doesn't go in for the usual blunt horror movie shocks, it succeeds in being moderately scary. As the tourists' everyday reality is invaded by terrifying hallucinatory flashes of Blair Witch mythology, ''Book of Shadows'' evokes mass hysteria as a horror-film fright show, cleverly even slipping in visual homages to everything from ''The Omen'' to ''The Night of the Living Dead.'' It all culminates in a gory (but discreetly filmed) orgy of Manson Family-esque butchery. For all its clever notions, ''Book of Shadows'' often seems more like a montage of pasted-together images than a coherent horror story. It also has some grating tonal incongruities. The buffoonish local sheriff (Lanny Flaherty) has it in for Jeff, and whenever he appears, the movie loses its hip, tongue-in-cheek edge. So does ''Book of Shadows'' prove that video tells the truth while film lies? Let's put it this way: the videos that supposedly document the worst-case scenario of what happened that night are tucked inside one very slick and manipulative film.''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of violence, nudity and profanity.

Review/Film; Woody Allen on the Loose in Kafka Country - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from March 20, 1992, Section C, Page 6Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. As Wolcott Gibbs once said to Shakespeare: Kafka, here's your hat. That's just one of the deliciously eccentric messages being sent out by Woody Allen in his rich, not easily categorized new black-and-white comedy, ""Shadows and Fog."" Among other things, ""Shadows and Fog"" contemplates life, death, love, literature, movies, American humor in general, the gags of Bob Hope in particular, the music of Kurt Weill and the changing fashions in B. V. D.'s. Kleinman (Mr. Allen) is a timid clerk in the kind of unidentified Middle European city once so beloved by Kafka, Kafka's imitators, the masters of the German Expressionist cinema of the 1920's and their imitators. It is always night in this closed world of miasmic fog, cobbled alleys and street lamps that shed too little light but cast photogenically deep shadows. Authority here is absolute and inscrutable. It may be represented by the police, by angry mobs or by Kleinman's petit bourgeois employer, whom Kleinman addresses with deference. He calls him ""your grace.""On this terrible night, death stalks the streets of the unidentified Middle European city, picking victims at random, strangling one fellow with piano wire, cutting another's throat ear to ear. His most heinous crime: the murder of pretty, virginal identical twins. Kleinman remains unaware, sleeping fretfully on the second floor of a grubby little rooming house where, you can be sure, the air is heavy with the smell of yesterday's overcooked cabbage. At 2:30 A. M., there is a sudden pounding on Kleinman's door. Men wearing long overcoats and fedoras push their way in. They say they need Kleinman's help in their search for the homicidal maniac. The exhausted fall-guy shivers in his underwear. What homicidal maniac? Don't ask so many questions, they say. They tell him he is part of their plan. What plan? There's no time to explain now, says the leader. Just get dressed and go outside. Someone will find him. For Kleinman, it's six of one, a half-dozen of the other. If the homicidal maniac doesn't get him, the vigilantes will. Kleinman reluctantly puts on his clothes and is leaving when confronted by his ferocious landlady. Even in the middle of the night, she is ready to pounce on Kleinman with a new proposal of marriage. He points out that he is engaged to Eve. ""She just wants you for an ornament,"" says the landlady. She pauses, surveys the accumulation of grim bibelots around them, and adds, ""Why would you want to marry Eve when you can have half of all this?""Thus begins the Passion of Kleinman, a hellish and funny succession of trials in a hostile nighttime Middle European landscape. Like ""Zelig,"" ""Shadows and Fog"" is a pastiche of references to the works of others, but it's a brazen, irrepressible original in the way it uses those references. How many times did you laugh while watching Steven Soderbergh's polite and doomy ""Kafka""?Mr. Allen sends up his sources to rediscover and celebrate them. Carlo Di Palma's black-and-white cinematography recalls the glories of a technology all but forgotten today, as do Santo Loquasto's elegantly stylized studio sets, which may remind you of those in John Ford's ""Informer.""Mr. Allen's screenplay is an expansion of his play ""Death,"" included in his collection ""Without Feathers,"" originally published by Random House. Among the characters created for the film is that of the camera, which doesn't merely record the events of this ghastly night of unreason. It is also a participant. The camera has a distinct personality, rather like that of a curious, independently minded cat. It watches Kleinman with sarcastic amusement and then goes off exploring on its own. It knows where the action is. It's privy to information that the bewildered Kleinman doesn't dream of. It anticipates events. While Kleinman wanders the streets, the camera turns up at the circus grounds where Irmy (Mia Farrow), the sword swallower, is trying to cheer up her lover, the Clown (John Malkovich), whose performance that night wasn't well received. Irmy doesn't help him by whining about their getting married. But she really gets under his skin when she says, in that nagging way of hers, ""I think you can always tell a lot about audiences by how they respond to a good sword swallower."" That's enough to send him off to the wagon of Marie (Madonna), the high-wire artist, where he's soon caught by Irmy. (The camera is already there.)Kleinman keeps meeting people who assume he's part of the plan, but who either can't or won't tell him what his part is. There's an obsessed coroner (Donald Pleasence), impatient to perform an autopsy on the killer as part of his study of the nature of evil. Meanwhile, poor Irmy, who has run away from the circus, is befriended by a philosophical prostitute (Lily Tomlin) and taken back to the brothel for a good hot meal. Irmy listens with fascination as the prostitutes (Ms. Tomlin, Jodie Foster, Kathy Bates, Anne Lange) talk about love, marriage and their clients. The camera, seemingly made drunk by their friendship and body warmth, swoops around the table where the prostitutes sit, peering into each face in turn as if seeing their humanity for the first time. Irmy is propositioned by a customer, Student Jack (John Cusack), who offers her $700 to have sex with him. The experience forever changes Irmy's life. Before the arrival of dawn, the original vigilante group has broken up into warring factions. The killer finds additional victims. Kleinman comes to the brothel saying that he has never before paid for sex. ""You just think you haven't,"" says Ms. Foster. Eventually a bogus seer with a sensitive nose sniffs Kleinman and identifies him as the killer. All that and much, much more. Mr. Allen is extravagant in his use of talent. He's now in a position to obtain the best actors available to do everything from starring and featured roles to what amount to walk-ons. Yet the strength of the film is such that recognizing, say, Kate Nelligan standing behind a window, seen briefly in long shot, does not interrupt the drama, but enriches it. A note of caution: ""Shadows and Fog"" operates on its own wavelength. It is different. It should not be anticipated in the manner of other Allen films. It's unpredictable, with its own tone and rhythm, even though, like all of the director's work, it's a mixture of the sincere, the sardonic and the classically sappy. A vigilante questions Kleinman: ""Are you a coward or a worm or a yellow-belly?"" ""No,"" says Kleinman, ""but keep going.""""Shadows and Fog,"" which has been rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned), has some sexually suggestive scenes and dialogue.

Morse; production designer, Santo Loquasto; produced by Helen Robin and Joseph Hartwick; Executive producers, Jack Rollins and Charles H. Joffe; released by Orion Pictures. Running time: 85 minutes.

Thanks to a philandering husband and a death in the family, a sensitive, boring Australian wife named Maria (Wendy Hughes) is given carte blanche to do what she may well have wanted to do in the first place. In ''Echoes of Paradise,'' Maria ventures to the turquoise waters and unspoiled beaches of Phuket, Thailand, for some much-needed respite. In Phuket, feeling furious at her husband, George (Steven Jacobs), and badly in need of adventure, Maria becomes involved with an exotic, long-haired Balinese dancer named Raka (John Lone), who dances exquisitely and gives terrific neck rubs. For a woman in Maria's position, Raka is just what the doctor ordered.''Echoes of Paradise,'' which opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse, was directed by Phillip Noyce, whose earlier and much better ''Newsfront'' had nothing of this film's soap-opera tone. But this time, the emphasis is on pretty scenery, touristy observations and breathy, pause-laden declarations (''I don't'' - pause - ''think I love you anymore''). When Maria does find herself feeling sufficiently liberated by Raka to embrace life more fully, she never achieves much more insight than that. ''Yes, I think Dad realized you have to decide what's real,'' she finally observes about her late father. ''He needed to dream as well - that's all.''Aside from scenery, the film's one focus of attention is John Lone, who looks mesmerizing with his long earring and even longer hair, and who brings the right quick, reptilian movements to the dancing he does here. However, even Mr. Lone is forced to spout the claptrap of which romance fiction is made.

Film Festival: 'The Hunt':Powerful Spanish Drama Touches On Civil War--2 Other Movies Shown - The New York Times,"all except the youngest in the group, who is evidently the son of a veteran—and they are stricken with morbidity. This is the daring implication that Mr. Saura has to make: That men who have enjoyed some successes, have evidently lived comfortably (able to indulge themselves in hunting) are now bitter, degenerate and cruel, suspicious and distrustful of one another, avid to shoot and kill—or, as in the case of one of them, to withdraw in a mood of jealousy and hate. Mr. Saura imparts his drama—his allegory, as it were, of war and of men fighting against their brothers—in some horrifyingly realistic scenes of men handling guns, shooting rabbits as the terrified creatures scurry up the hills, baking in the sun, grimly quarreling and finally blasting away at one another in frenzied duels. Tension grows, violence trembles and finally disaster bursts.""The Hunt"" is a powerful picture, and it merits further showing here. The late show at the festival last evening was an unusual Ukrainian film, ""Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors,"" which was made in 1964 to celebrate the 100th birthday anniversary of the Ukrainian novelist, Michalo Kotsiubinsky, from one of whose books this film was made. It is a colorfully staged and photographed presentation of a folk-tale tragedy all about a handsome peasant who loves and loses one beautiful girl, marries another, but cannot get over the girl he initially loved. Its principal asset as motion picture is the brilliant reproduction of ancient customs and traditional sentiments. It also has a spectacular and abundant musical score that carries much more emotion than the actors convey. On the bill with the latter was Jiri Trnka's Czechoslovak puppet film, ""The Hand."" It is a stunning little picture about a happy, independent artisan who is besieged and finally driven to distraction by a persistently giant hand. This is another picture that has surprisingly political overtones. The festival did rather nicely by the protesters in one night.",http://www.nytimes.com/1966/09/20/archives/film-festival-the-hunt-powerful-spanish-drama-touches-on-civil-war2.html
Film Improvised Under Cassavetes Opens - The New York Times,"only to help them to ""improvise"" their performances—it's amazing there's a film here at all. It's a wonder that this frankly offbeat picture, which originated as an exercise for a group of students of acting, working catch as catch can in New York under the supervision of John Cassavetes, who was then but an actor himself, is anything more than a bleak conglomeration of histrionic showing-off, parlor-game story contrivance and 16-mm. home photography. To be honest about it, there are times when it does appear that this little drama of New York night people was flung together by precocious amateurs. There are sequences that have no clear connection or apparent necessity to the plot, are too long or too loosely constructed and leave you feeling that the only reason they are in the picture is because somebody was in love with them. There are individual scenes that the actors, groping obviously for ""business"" and words, or starting off with bursts of ""improvisation"" and not knowing when or how to stop, infuse with annoyingly sluggish tempo or the clatter of too much talk.""Shadows"" is an unfinished picture in every sense of the word. Yet it is fitfully dynamic, endowed with a raw but vibrant strength, conveying an illusion of being a record of real people, and it is incontestably sincere. Some of its crude compulsion is in the poignancy of the story told, some of it is in the vigorous acting, virtually all of which is good. The simple drama, which was casually concocted as they went along, revolves around a Negro girl who is ""passing""—not deliberately or surreptitiously, but simply because she looks white and is herself indifferent to the matter of race. Then one night she meets a pleasant white lad at a ""literary affair,"" gives herself to him in all innocence and is plunged into shame and grief when he meets her brothers, discovers she is a Negro and goes (or is driven) away. This is obviously a rotation that provides a succession of strong scenes, the kind that ""method"" actors who are ""feeling it"" love to play. But the youngsters resist temptation in the key scenes with commendable restraint. Lelia Goldoni, who brings a freshness and a touching sort of natural gaucherie to the role of the girl, is most potent in the difficult pre and post seduction scenes, when she reveals her naïveté to her boy friend, played with sweetness and callowness by Anthony Ray. Hugh Hurd is generally excellent as the robust older brother of the girl, charging a stubborn personality with temper, tenderness and pride. Ben Carruthers makes the gangling younger brother a pathetically showy, insecure near hood, leader of a trio of wastrels, the other two of whom are played with studied clowning by Tom Allen and Dennis Sallas. The camera style of Erich Kollmar is uneven, disconcerting with its stiff close-ups in spots, betraying that the camera had to follow rather than calculate the points of emphasis. But this, too— like the editing of Mr. Cassavetes, which is where his ""direction"" mainly prevailed—imparts an ultimate sense of the impromptu and self-assertive nature of this little film. We wouldn't want to say ""improvisation"" is most congenial to story cinema, but it has made for an interesting impact in this instance. ""Shadows"" is more than an actors' stunt.

Although it is offering real and ridiculous safaris through darkest Africa via ""Black Shadows"" and ""Zamba,"" respectively, the management of the Gotham is not proving that this trip is absolutely necessary. For both films in this bargain bill, which was unveiled on Saturday, are concerned, in the main, with gorillas and the Belgian Congo but only ""Black Shadows"" is worthy of attention. The release of ""Zamba"" from its Hollywood compound is to be deplored. Despite the fact that he is journeying over an area that has been explored and filmed before. André Cauvin's hour-long travelogue, ""Black Shadows,"" contains enough footage on the fauna and customs of that teeming continent to make the trek interesting if not entirely new. Seeking gorillas for scientific study, the expedition makes its way from Europe by plane, car, native dugouts and on foot through Leopoldville, the gateway to the Congo, to the steaming jungle. En route, the animals, tribes and ceremonies photographed run the gamut from the seemingly spurious to a pitifully tragic climax showing an infant gorilla clinging to the dead carcass of its mother. While that scene might not particularly endear the explorers to audiences, sequences showing handsome, giant Watusis, allegedly descended from Egyptians, dancing a graceful native ballet, is educational and arresting. Equally arresting are the shots of a tribe addicted to flagellation, wherein warriors brutally belabor each other with whips fashioned from long, slender saplings. Count as an apparently unreal and gruesome stop in the safari a scene showing a secret ritual of the Leopard Men. The commentary narrated by Jeff Corey is, however, not entirely relegated to such unpalatable goings-on. For the cameras also have caught other views in traversing immense Albert Park. Within that national preserve are seen lions, elephants, zebras, eland and the capture of a rare okapi. And, along the way, a local potentate marries his thirty-sixth wife and some native ladies stoically submit to some painful tattooing. In short, ""Black Shadows"" culminating in a tragic but unexciting climax, is a fair travelogue, which has a few unusual and interesting moments.""Zamba,"" on the other hand, has nothing of interest. It is a feeble fiction about a boy who is separated from his mother after the pair parachute into the jungle from a burning plane. The youngster, suffering from amnesia, is adopted by a gorilla, named Zamba and fearsome enough to make a misogynist out of King Kong. The boy is finally saved and brought back to civilization by his mother and a pair of hunters, all of whom have more trouble with the script than with the ferocious livestock surrounding them. And so, as far as this dreary adventure is concerned, we say goodby to Africa and good riddance.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""Marriage in the Shadows"" is the type of German film that will have a lot more meaning in its home market than elsewhere. This semi-factual drama of how two lives were shattered by the Nazis' maniacal anti-Semitism throws no new light for American moviegoers on an infamous interlude in history. Indeed the picture, which opened yesterday at the Little Met Theatre, follows a pattern that has become stereotyped, thus leading one to suspect that German artists have not yet acquired any perspective about the crimes to which they were passive or active contributors. It is, however, encouraging to note that the German cinema is being used in some measure to reflect the nation's shameful disavowal of the fundamental principles of humanity, respect for one's fellow-man. Pictures such as ""Marriage in the Shadows"" must be a bitter pill for the Germans to swallow, but they may prove to be effective purgatives in time. It is unfortunate just the same that ""Marriage in the Shadows"" does not possess more sharply apparent dramatic quality, for then its persuasiveness would be more penetrating. The film is supposed to parallel the life of the popular German actor, Joachim Gottschalk, who took a Jewish actress as his wife and in a final gesture of defiance and contempt of Nazism's racial prejudice ended their marriage by suicide. Spanning a ten-year period from 1933, the film slowly generates the mounting terror experienced by German Jews as more and more came under the shadow of death, and it castigates the lassitude of responsible, articulate Germans for not reacting with courage and fortitude when the Nazis first began their atrocities. In these and other respects ""Marriage in the Shadows"" has commendable purpose and it has, moreover, a fine bit of acting by Paul Klinger. Some of the direction is arresting, too, but more often it is loose knit and the vapor effects used as scene dissolves is more distracting than distinctive. Use Steppat was not too fortunate a choice as the wife, however, for her range is extremely limited for one impersonating a great actress.

"‘Bad Boys for Life’ Review: In a Minivan, but Still Riding - The New York Times","delivering a mildly enjoyable movie that committed fans of the franchise will rate a lot higher — but they have to hack through a lot of by-the-numbers plotting and indolent characterizations to get there. The opening sequence depicts Will Smith’s Mike Lowrey at the wheel of a Porsche, speeding furiously, while Martin Lawrence’s Marcus Burnett shouts loud enough to drown out the engine. As it’s been 17 years since “Bad Boys II,” one might smell a midlife-male punch line, and sure enough, they are in a hurry to attend the birth of Marcus’s grandson. Marcus, hence, would like to stop and smell the roses; Mike thinks retirement is a dirty word. A vengeful assassin, the son of a drug cartel matriarch on a mission, bloodies the waters of their argument by taking a few shots at Mike. Six months later, a new division of the Miami P. D., led by a former paramour of Mike’s, is puzzling over the ammo that hit the detective. (AMMO is also the acronym of the new, tech-savvy division, Advanced Miami Metro Operations.) Going rogue, or roguish, Mike finds its source, forms an alliance with the new kids, and, over the objections of good ol’ Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano, here channeling a demon hybrid of Joe Pesci and Rudolph Giuliani) gets in the ring, with a very reluctant Marcus following. The screenplay by Chris Bremmer, Peter Craig and Joe Carnahan offers buddy-cop greatest hits dialogue like “He dies last” “We had a deal,”; “If it’s the cartel, she’s gonna have serious backup”; and the ominous “One last time? One last time.” But Lawrence’s riffs almost always land. They especially need to in the final quarter, when the movie sets the bar high for this year’s Dopiest Movie Plot Twist competition. It’s a moment that’s meant to enhance character and raise emotional stakes, and the movie takes it seriously for maybe a minute and 45 seconds before Lawrence’s character starts making light of it. This is as it should be. As for the action, the directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah (taking over from Michael Bay, who has a coy cameo as a wedding M. C.) blow things up real good, and do so in ways that are more often buoyant than grisly. Bad Boys for LifeRated R. Bad boys, whatcha gonna do?

"Review: In ‘Slow Learners,’ Aspirational Hedonists Doff Their Glasses - The New York Times","The romantic comedy “Slow Learners” opens with Jeff (Adam Pally from “The Mindy Project”) enduring his latest first date to go south: “You’re just soft and doughy,” she explains helpfully. “You’re sort of like an old baby.” His friend Anne (Sarah Burns of “Enlightened”), a fellow nerdy high school teacher, is equally tired of the wallflower life, and they vow to use the summer break to become the cool hedonists of their dreams. “I want to be sex-in-a-bathroom people!” Anne chirps. Well, sure, who doesn’t?Apparently, all that’s required is ditching your khakis and cardigans, getting new hairdos and drinking heavily in clubs where women dance on bars and guys get into fights. Hipness has its hazards, of course: by the time they are sexually hyperactive, Jeff and Anne have become cruel and indifferent to their friends and family. Raise your hand if you know how this one ends; as rom-coms go, there is nothing new here. But “Slow Learners” shows that there doesn’t need to be. Directed by Don Argott and Sheena M. Joyce, on leave from making documentaries (“The Art of the Steal,” “The Atomic States of America”), the film traffics in the usual genre suspects: the parents who ask whether Jeff is gay, the married B. F. F. who coaches Anne from the sidelines. Even so, Mr. Pally, Ms. Burns and the rest of the cast deliver sharp dialogue in weapons-grade deadpan. Reid Scott (“Veep”) is the comfortable ladies’ man next door, and Bobby Moynihan and Cecily Strong of “Saturday Night Live” make their cameos sting. The screenplay is credited to Matt Serword, but many lines feel as if the cameras had kept rolling while everyone improvised. Only a few scenes fail to draw laughs in a movie that’s unexpectedly smart and consistently amusing. In August, yet.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/movies/review-in-slow-learners-aspirational-hedonists-doff-their-glasses.html
"FILM REVIEW; Hot Cars, Burning Rubber And Guys Good and Bad - The New York Times","Let's begin with a traffic report. This has been an unusually chaotic summer on the freeways and boulevards of South Florida and Southern California -- in the movies anyway. First there were Laurence Fishburne and Keanu Reeves somersaulting on top of a speeding semi in ''The Matrix Reloaded'' to the sound of grinding gears and complaining metal. This was followed in short order by the big chase at the end of ''Hollywood Homicide,'' the Mitsubishi mating dance in ''2 Fast 2 Furious'' and Arnold Schwarzenegger swinging from the end of a giant crane in ''Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.''Now, hoping to outdo them all in automotive wreckage and box office damage, here is ''Bad Boys II,'' in which a posse of bad guys commandeers a trailer loaded with new cars that they drive at high speed along a stretch of Miami highway, flinging the cargo onto the road behind them at Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who are in furious pursuit. ''Did you see that?'' Mr. Lawrence exclaims as a Buick spirals overhead. To which Mr. Smith replies: ''They're throwing cars. How am I not going to see that?''Later a different set of bad guys (not to be confused with the bad boys of the title, Mr. Smith and Mr. Lawrence, who are good guys) will do a similar trick, only with embalmed corpses, one of which is graphically decapitated by another vehicle. But perhaps it is time to cut away from the chase.''Bad Boys II,'' in which Mr. Smith and Mr. Lawrence once again play a pair of Miami police detectives named Mike and Marcus, is the latest collaboration between Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced it, and Michael Bay, who directed. (Ron Shelton, director of the much better ''Hollywood Homicide,'' helped write the screenplay.) This one follows in the tradition of the earlier Bruckheimer-Bay pictures -- the first ''Bad Boys,'' ''The Rock,'' ''Armageddon'' and ''Pearl Harbor'' -- all of which made a lot of money and were otherwise pretty much worthless. Mr. Bruckheimer, who is routinely identified in publicity material as ''the most successful producer of all time,'' is not a man for subtlety or for half measures. This summer he has, at least momentarily, outdone himself, releasing two movies -- ''Bad Boys II'' and ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' -- within 10 days. The two films have an aggregate running time just shy of five hours. (''Boys,'' at 144 minutes, is 11 minutes longer than ''Pirates.'') Anyone contemplating a double feature should come prepared with a large bottle of Tylenol. I can't say I recommend the experience, but it's your money, at least until Mr. Bruckheimer gets his hands on it. Quite a bit was clearly spent on the assaultive, bombastic, and occasionally funny spectacle that is ''Bad Boys II.'' Mr. Bay may lack restraint (also taste, wit and shame), but he does have an undeniable flair for sleaze, noise and vulgarity. One of his most impressive feats is to film a nightclub rave scene so that the camera glides under the skirts and between the legs of the women. There is something leering and nasty about this that makes the more pervasive ogling in ''Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle'' seem downright wholesome. A similarly cold, aggressive voyeurism characterizes the film's violence, which is relentless and often gruesome. Corpses are probed for drugs hidden inside them; a bucket of severed limbs, still dripping blood, is placed on a dining-room table. Several times Mr. Bay uses slow motion to track the course of a speeding bullet, climaxing with its explosive, splattery impact on a human body. David O. Russell used a similar effect in ''Three Kings'' as a graphic and terrifying illustration of what a gunshot can do. Here it is meant to produce a dumb, visceral, involuntary thrill. The audience at the screening I attended responded on cue to each exploding cranium and mangled tosro, with oohs and oofs and wows (as well as less printable interjections), and so, helplessly, did I. If you calculate entertainment value as the ratio of such conditioned responses to the price of the ticket, ''Bad Boys II,'' which opens today nationwide, is undoubtedly a bargain. The last half-hour, during which an ornate Cuban villa and a hillside shantytown are demolished, bloats the experience into a super-size fast-food meal: thousands of useless calories are added at no extra cost (to the viewer, that is). Afterward you feel sluggish and glutted, groggy and numb. The cast, in contrast, appear fit and energetic. The best moments come when Mr. Smith and Mr. Lawrence are permitted to pause from their action-hero duties and run their funny, unpredictable mouths. At one point, to no discernible narrative purpose, they team up to terrify a young man who has come to take Marcus's daughter on a date, and their parody of thuggish bravado seems like a sly sendup of the movie itself. The running joke is that in the midst of fighting off heavily armed, vicious criminals, Mike and Marcus must deal with their volatile working relationship. Marcus says Mike has ''emotional anger issue problems,'' but Mike is, if anything, the more even-keeled of the two, despite Marcus's embrace of anger-management techniques and therapeutic nostrums. (Their put-upon captain, played by Joe Pantoliano, may be the most hot-tempered Buddhist this side of Steven Seagal). The main difference between the partners is that Marcus is a family man (his infinitely patient wife is played, in too few scenes, by Teresa Randle), while Mike is, in his partner's words, ''a dog.'' He also happens to be sweet on Marcus's younger sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union), an undercover federal agent who is mixed up in their case, and whose abduction by the chief bad guy occasions the unauthorized invasion of Cuba at the end of the movie. That bad guy (Jordi Mollà) is a walking ethnic cliché with a five-day stubble, an impenetrable accent, a closet full of white linen suits and a staff of oily henchmen. He also has a young daughter, whose death in that exploding villa is implied but not shown, which represents on the filmmakers' part either a rare exercise of tact or a failure of imagination.''Bad Boys II'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). One or two scenes do not include graphic violence, drug references, or partial nudity, and there may be a line of dialogue that does not contain profanity.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""Bad Boys"" wasn't imagined so much as it was stitched together, like some cinematic Frankenstein's monster, from the body parts of other movies. There is the mismatched cop-buddy angle from ""Lethal Weapon,"" this time with Martin Lawrence as the loyal family man and Will Smith as his partner, the handsome womanizer. As they try to track down the sophisticated thieves who stole $100 million worth of heroin from the police department's evidence room, they acquire a spunky, female sidekick, a la ""Speed."" There is the Miami setting from ""The Specialist,"" exploding trucks from ""True Lies"" and enough shattering glass to rival either of the ""Die Hards."" But formulas exist because they work, and ""Bad Boys"" is a loud, fast, action movie laced with comedy. In this case, the genre shows few signs of wearing itself out. Mr. Lawrence, a stand-up comic and star of the sitcom ""Martin,"" and Mr. Smith of the television series ""The Fresh Prince"" and the film ""Six Degrees of Separation,"" approach their roles as comic actors rather than action stars, and their playful attitude helps. Mr. Lawrence is Marcus, hyperactive and easily ruffled. Mr. Smith is Mike, the calm one, who has a trust fund and a lavish bachelor apartment but whose dedication to his work is, of course, unrivaled. Mike and Marcus confiscated all that heroin in the first place, only to have it stolen by an arrogant European villain (Tcheky Karyo), the logical foil to the down-home detectives. They have four days to recover the goods before the F. B. I. steps in. In no time, a prostitute is killed by the thieves while trying to help Mike get information. This has two results: it leaves her best friend, Julie, as the sole witness; it reinforces the time-honored movie rule that hookers are always more expendable than nice girls. Julie (Tea Leoni) calls Mike for help; he's away from the phone so Marcus pretends to be Mike, setting things up for the old ""Prince and the Pauper"" gag. For most of the movie, the family man has to live Mike's bachelor life while Mike looks after Marcus's family. The dialogue is not as snappy as it should be. ""The bad guys probably know where you live"" is saved by Mr. Lawrence's mocking delivery. The actors liven up their lines where they can and let the first-rate action carry the rest. Eventually, Julie, Mike and Marcus end up in a truck filled with barrels of flammable ether, the villains racing after them. Mike sends the barrels out on the road, shoots them on fire and sends them roaring into the cars. And there are bigger explosions ahead.""Bad Boys"" is the first feature by Michael Bay, a 30-year-old director. His background in music videos is evident in the jumpy camera movement and quick cuts; his background as a maker of beer commercials is evident in the conspicuous beer signs that clutter the background. The film is produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, the team behind ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Top Gun."" They know the action turf well and should have known better than to stumble into the trend to make movies longer. ""Bad Boys"" is just over two hours, and would have been better if it had been sleeker and shorter. After all, this film isn't aiming for high-toned drama, just high-energy entertainment, which is what it delivers.""Bad Boys"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes much rude language, a gruesome corpse and other bleeding, shot-up bodies. BAD BOYS Directed by Michael Bay; written by Michael Barrie, Jim Mulholland and Doug Richardson, based on the story by George Gallo; director of photography, Howard Atherton; edited by Christian Wagner; music by Mark Mancina; production designer, John Vallone; produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer; released by Columbia Pictures.

'BAD BOYS' IN JAIL - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from March 25, 1983, Section C, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. THE reform-school saga ''Bad Boys'' gets off to a crackling start, as it intercuts the stories of two teen-age hoodlums about to run afoul of the law. They're also about to become deadly enemies, after Mick O'Brien (Sean Penn) becomes the hit-and-run killer of a young Puerto Rican boy. The victim is the brother of Paco Moreno (Esai Morales), an especially hard-boiled gang member, who vows revenge on Mick, even though Mick has become temporarily unavailable. A judge, declaring Mick to have a sociopathic personality, has sentenced him to Rainford Juvenile Correctional Facility. This, if the movie's persistent claims to realism are to be believed, is an outstandingly vile place even as snakepits go. However, Rainford, as the movie presents it, has some peculiar attributes. For all the sadism and the ugliness on display - whoever did the black-eye makeup for this movie really worked overtime - it's a peculiarly orderly place. For every bad youth of any given minority, there's a correspondingly nice prison official. And such basic elements of prison nastiness as racial infighting and homosexual rape are relatively soft-pedaled here. Rainford's two tyrants among the inmates are a black thug and a white one, and they are implausibly ousted by the much smaller Mick and his roommate, Horowitz. As played by Eric Gurry, the tiny prodigy Horowitz is a real scene stealer. But it's impossible to believe either that he wandered into Rainford on his way to the Bronx High School of Science (the screenplay's explanation for his presence is only slightly less far-fetched), or that he'd survive for even 15 minutes in such a place. Though ''Bad Boys,'' which opens today at Loew's New York Twin, has been directed by Richard (''Halloween II'') Rosenthal with a shrewdly manipulative flair, it eventually becomes nothing but ugly and sustains that quality to the bitter end. After all, there is almost nothing in the script by Richard Di Lello to make Mick O'Brien a sympathetic character. The best he can do, by the end of the drama, is to refrain from killing somebody; that's about the size of his moral redemption. Not much improvement from the story's beginning, which presents him as a ruthless petty criminal simply waiting to go on to bigger, if not better, things. When a prison counselor, played by Reni Santoni, tells Mick, ''That was no accident, you would've killed somebody sooner or later,'' the observation rings true. Sean Penn's performance is the chief thing that separates ''Bad Boys'' from mere exploitation. The film is by no means uniformly well acted; some of the goons are even more goonish than the story requires. But Mr. Penn, who has been given almost nothing to say and only the most mundane of hopes and dreams (he wants to be with his girlfriend, nicely played by Ally Sheedy), gives Mick a quiet forcefulness and some superb instincts where his own self-protection is concerned. The audience is sure to be on Mick's side, not because he's admirable in any way but because Mr. Penn makes it clear that he's got a chance to survive. That, in the movie's mean-spirited scheme, is no minor accomplishment.''Bad Boys'' is a suspenseful movie, but it's also an extremely brutal one. It begins with someone's brains spattered on a wall, and ends with a particularly bloody battle. In between, there's a lot more of the same.

"FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; The Nun, the Amnesiac, the Prostitute and the Thugs - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from September 29, 1994, Section C, Page 16Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Many romantic triangles are bizarre, but in ""Amateur"" Hal Hartley has concocted the most irresistibly strange one to hit the screen in a long time. A pretty former nun is trying to earn a living by writing for pornographic magazines. She falls for a sensitive man who has amnesia and traces of a sordid past. He is still married to a prostitute, who is trying to kill him and leave her old life behind. Add to this an arms dealer who sends his thugs after the prostitute, and life couldn't be more complicated or more deliciously droll. The nun, the amnesiac and the prostitute fit neatly into Mr. Hartley's distinctive world, a place that is always serious and comically absurd. ""Amateur"" is his most ambitious view of that world yet. Isabelle Huppert plays Isabelle, who sits in a coffee shop all day nursing a cup of coffee and talking out loud as she labors over her pornographic stories. She is just 10 months out of the convent and still a virgin, so it's no wonder she rarely earns enough food money. Thomas (Martin Donovan) is first seen lying unconscious on a street in TriBeCa, where Sofia (Elina Lowensohn), a woman in a whorish outfit, runs away from him. He wanders into the coffee shop with a pocketful of Dutch coins and no memory of his past. But he is so obviously a good, respectable man that Isabelle offers him a place to stay. Soon she is explaining, without a hint of lunatic fervor, that God has chosen her for some mission that she can accomplish only outside the convent. She also explains that she is a nymphomaniac as well as a virgin.""How can you be a nymphomaniac and never have sex?"" Thomas asks.""I'm choosy,"" Isabelle answers, in a tone so matter-of-fact you have to believe her. Though Thomas has amnesia, Sofia certainly remembers him. He lured her into a world of drugs and prostitution when she was 12 and later married her, but the honeymoon is over. She is the one who pushed him out a window, causing his memory loss. All the marks of Mr. Hartley's sharp yet leisurely style are here: the skewed dialogue that never leaves the believable world behind, and the actors whose deadpan readings make that skewed dialogue seem true. Mr. Hartley's earlier films -- ""The Unbelievable Truth,"" ""Trust"" and ""Simple Men"" -- involved hermetic family situations, with larger issues as comic backdrops. With ""Amateur"" he leaps into a sleazy adult world that allows him to take on weightier issues more directly. This is a wry look at the social roles people play and the ""real"" characters hidden beneath them. Thomas literally wakes up a new man after his fall from the window, but others are shedding outdated roles, too. The nun discovers romantic desire, the prostitute becomes a wholesome heroine, and even the pornographer who hires Isabelle sees himself as a once-and-future muckraking reporter. The tone of this film is intentionally darker than Mr. Hartley's earlier work, but his playful attitude guarantees that he never becomes pretentious. The key is finding actors perfectly in sync with his understated attitude. Ms. Huppert's expressive face and sincere tone make Isabelle both innocent and smart. ""When I make mistakes,"" she says flatly of her 15 years in the convent, ""they tend to be big ones.""Mr. Donovan perfected the Hartley style in ""Trust"" and ""Simple Men."" As Thomas overhears troubling details about himself, he creates a sense of low-key amazement, as if Thomas were thinking, ""That doesn't sound like me, but anything is possible."" Ms. Lowensohn, who was also in ""Simple Men,"" makes Sofia's transformation totally convincing. Between her slight Romanian accent and Ms. Huppert's even slighter French accent, ""Amateur"" exists in a world that is familiar and foreign at once. A blackmail plot is the device Mr. Hartley uses to send his characters racing through evocative settings, photographed by Michael Spiller with a slight bluish cast that makes the ordinary look mysterious. Sofia escapes thugs in Grand Central station. Later, the three of them wind up in Thomas's apartment, where Isabelle puts on Elina's tight black work clothes and a subtle trade of identities begins. Eventually they flee the thugs by running to Isabelle's old convent and a medieval atmosphere (the scenes were filmed at the Cloisters) far from the grimy downtown streets where Isabelle lives. Much humor in ""Amateur"" comes from its mockery of suspense movies, and much from minor characters. Edward (Damian Young) is trying to save Sofia, and his wild-eyed, manic look brings to mind Renfield in ""Dracula."" A wonderfully overwrought police officer named Patsy Melville (Pamela Stewart) is always about to burst into sympathetic tears over her missing-person reports.""Amateur"" will be shown at the New York Film Festival tonight at 9 and tomorrow at midnight and is scheduled to be released commercially in April. While refining his style, Mr. Hartley obviously has plenty of surprises left.""Suspicious,"" which will be shown before ""Amateur,"" is a wittily acted 15-minute film by David Koepp. Janeane Garofolo plays a nervous woman who drives into a gas station late at night and finds an attendant whose intense stares make her uneasy. It helps that he's played by Michael Rooker, better known as the title character in ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer."" The film shares some of Hal Hartley's wryness.

"'THE AMATEUR,' COLD WAR HUNT - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from April 17, 1982, Section 1, Page 10Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Movies that sneak into town without advance screenings don't ordinarily amount to much. But ''The Amateur,'' which opened yesterday at the Criterion Center and other theaters, is better than one might expect. As cold-war thrillers go, this is an efficient and enjoyable one, with a good cast, a clever if overburdened plot, and a stylish brand of mayhem. The final shootout, for example, takes place in a warehouse full of mirrors and crystal chandeliers. Another scene is set in a bar that has an underwater view of a swimming pool. The action, in a screenplay by Robert Littell and Diana Maddox based on Mr. Littell's novel, begins with a terrorist attack on the United States Consulate in Munich. One American hostage, a sweetlooking young woman (played briefly but well by Lynne Griffin) is coldly executed in full view of a television news camera. She turns out to have been the girlfriend of Charles Heller (John Savage), who has the audience's absolute sympathy from this point on. Mr. Savage approaches this role in his usual close-to-the-vest manner, but he makes Heller expressive enough for the character's grief to register - and steely enough to explain the revenge mission on which he soon embarks. Heller, who, like half the people in this elaborate story, happens to know a lot about Elizabethan literature, is also a computer expert. He codes and decodes messages for the Central Intelligence Agency. When he decides to go to Prague to find his girlfriend's killers, the agency is reluctant to let him loose, so Heller applies a little pressure. He sneaks into his office at night and decodes evidence of a Central Intelligence Agency--planned execution of a foreign leader. He puts this information back into code. Then he tinkers with a video-arcade computer that ordinarily produces horoscopes, and fills it with the top-secret information. He tells his late girlfriend's father the access code to the computer and lets a newspaper reporter know that if Heller doesn't return from Prague in three months he can have the key, break the code and print the story. Anyone who likes plots this tricky and convoluted ought to like ''The Amateur'' pretty well. As directed with uncharacteristic flair by Charles (''The Other Side of Midnight'') Jarrott, this is a fast-moving thriller with some pleasantly improbable gimmicks. Christopher Plummer appears as a Czechoslovak Elizabethan scholar who moonlights for the K. G. B.; this means that, in addition to the intrigue plot, there is plenty of debate between Mr. Savage and Mr. Plummer about whether William Shakespeare's works were really written by Francis Bacon. The rest of ''The Amateur'' is farfetched enough to keep touches like this from seeming even remotely out of place. The film is noteworthy for its scenery, too. It was shot in Washington, Toronto and Vienna, with its Viennese sequences, which are supposed to be Prague sequences, particularly handsome. The cinematographer was John Coquillon.

"' The Amateur Gentleman,' a Colorful Romance, at the Roxy -- 'Pride of the Marines' at the Globe. - The New York Times","best of all — ""The Amateur Gentleman."" So it is inevitable that any film edition of a Farnol novel which does not follow the original faithfully must prove disappointing. The film of ""The Amateur Gentleman,"" at the Roxy, admits it has been ""freely adapted""; Q. E. D. It is a disappointment and fellow-students of Farnol will be wary. Still, there probably are millions of non-Farnol readers at large, unfortunate souls, and, having no preconceived notions of the amateur gentleman and his invasion of London in 1810, they in all likelihood will accept the new photoplay as a properly romantic, adventurous and colorful tale. It was produced in England by Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s new company, Criterion Films, and has been performed with considerable skill by Mr. Fairbanks himself, by Elissa Landi as the Lady Cleone, Gordon Harker as Natty Bell, Basil Sydney as the evil Chichester and Frank Pettingell as Glorious John Barty, former heavyweight champion of England and now keeper of the rustic Pride of the Fancy Inn. In this liberally altered version young Barnabas Barty goes to London, not to become an amateur gentleman on the strength of a huge inheritance from an uncle, but to discover the knave who stole the Marquess of Camberhurst's jewels as he slept serenely in the Barty Inn. There are two suspects, the lovely Lady Cleone's brother and her completely unlovely suitor, Chichester. Only by posing as one of the ""nobs"" and winning access to high society can Barnabas exonerate Glorious John, who stands convicted of the crime and has been sentenced to be hanged in accordance with the pleasant criminal code of Regency England. And so, in tight breeches, frilled cravat and flounces, the innkeeper's son becomes part of the lively pageant of old London, engages in a bare-knuckled fist fight, pleases the Prince Regent, woos the Lady Cleone and outwits Chichester handsomely. Barring the setting, the tale might have been penned by an Erie Stanley Gardner or a Leslie Charteris, for Mr. Farnol was never much of a hand at writing detective stories.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Warner Baxter and Marian Nixon are the principals in a film version of Mildred Cram's novel, ""Scotch Valley,"" which comes to the Roxy screen as ""Amateur Daddy."" The generous fund of old-fashioned hokum in this feature appeared to find favor with an audience yesterday afternoon. The characters are either astonishingly noble or extremely vicious, but, as is anticipated long before the climax, the good are well rewarded and the evildoers are properly punished. John Blystone's direction is quite capable in some sequences, especially when he is dealing with the youngsters in the cast, but in a few episodes it is not a little abrupt. It is, however, one of those subjects intended to arouse sympathy and dislike, to make spectators laugh a little and weep a little. Here Mr. Baxter impersonates Jim Gladden, a construction engineer, who is first beheld on the girders of a new bridge. Rain has delayed the work and Gladden is eager to have the exhausted men keep on the job. Fred Smith, Gladden's assistant, is fatally hurt in a fall, and on his deathbed he asks Gladden to go to Scotch Valley, in California, and do what he can for his family. When Gladden reaches Scotch Valley he learns that there are two families of Smiths, one of which owns most of the oil land in the area, and the other is very poor. Gladden decides that the poor Smiths are the right ones. He is greeted with a shotgun in the hands of Sally Smith, the oldest of four children, who are alone in a ramshackle house, but he prevails upon her to put down the weapon, as he is not, as she thinks, a county official. There is no food in the house, and therefore Gladden, hearing that the village is eight miles distant, goes to a neighbor, named Sam Pelgram, who is just about as heartless as old Scrooge. He refuses to give Gladden a lift in his car or lend him some food. Mrs. Pelgram, as soon as she knows that her husband has gone, looks at Gladden coyly and consents to give him a basket of groceries. Then this strange creature embraces Gladden. Later finding herself the woman scorned, she reveals a hatred for Gladden. There are sequences in which Gladden attends to the children in true paternal fashion. Many of these scenes stirred up laughter, chiefly because of one youngster's patter and her speedy manner of saying her prayers. The sinister Pelgram intimates that there is something wrong about Gladden's presence in the Smith home, and he is knocked down by the amateur daddy. Pelgram, however, is persistent, and he gathers together several men, who take Gladden out, tie him to a tree and whip him. Toward the end of the story, Fred Smith, the father of the children Gladden has been caring for, turns up, after having served a jail sentence. Gladden then realizes that he has been looking after the wrong family, but Smith does not survive long, for he is shot and killed by Pelgram, and Gladden, who has fallen in love with Sally Smith, as she has with him, continues to care for the wrong Smiths. Mr. Baxter gives a pleasing and easy performance. Miss Nixon is quite capable as Sally, and David Landau is sufficiently forbidding as Pelgram. The stage show consists of ""Amarilla,"" a gypsy romance, with Patricia Bowman, Alexander Gavrilov and others; ""Exodus,"" with Ivanstzoff, the Roxyettes and the ballet corps; ""Les Gelles"" and ""Mood Exotique.""AMATEUR DADDY, based on a novel by Mildred Cram; directed by John Blystone; produced by the Fox Film Corporation.

Scenes of Old England. - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from August 17, 1926, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Colorful glimpses of old England are depicted in the film transcription of Jeffrey Farnol's novel, ""The Amateur Gentleman,"" now at the Mark Strand. This photoplay takes one back to the days when heroines were haughty and villians were knights; when plots were hatched in picturesque wayside inns; when usury thrived and the hawk-eyed game keepers were kept on the alert by poachers; when men fought with bare fists and old sea captains bragged of their capacity for port wine and were proud of a hook for a hand. Although this picture is not alive with suspense, it has its captivating moments, due to the frank and simple manner in which it has been produced and Richard Barthelmess's sympathetic portrayal of Barnabas Barty, the handsome son of an ex-pugilist and innkeeper, who, on inheriting a huge fortune, aspires to be a gentleman. After a discussion with his robust father, he is quite content that the best he can expect is to be an amateur gentleman. Sidney Olcott, producer of the film conception of ""Little Old New York,"" directed this subject, and it is obvious that this production might have been a better piece of work had some unnecessary details been skipped and more attention paid to the incidents through which Barty gains his polish. It is one of those pictures that has no little mirth in junctures intended to be anything but comical. For instance, Lady Cleone Meredith is thrown from her horse, and while she is still unconscious Barty and the persistent Sir Mortimer Carnaby hold a heated discussion which ends in a fight, in which Barty comes off the victor. The hero then turns his attention to Lady Cleone, who is slowly recovering from her fall. In a little shooting episode three men topple over simultaneously and are therefore seen in different postures of suffering. This scene, instead of giving the audience a shock, caused many persons to giggle and laugh. In the early chapters Barty's main efforts to become a gentleman appear to be confined to learning from a book how to bow. Later he enlists the assistance of a poacher, who had been a valet to various noblemen, and this renegade menial not only teaches Barty how to act but what to wear. It was all in the days of George III, when the essential article of sartorial equipment was an embroidered waistcoat.""Why is your eye in mourning?"" the villain is asked by a friend, and it is later discovered that the redoubtable Barty is responsible for the villain's disfigured countenance. Barty can really ride a horse, and he triumphs in a steeplechase, much to Sir Mortimer's annoyance. The scenery, although the picture was made in Hollywood, is quite effective, and the sets of the old houses and streets do their share to help the entertainment. Mr. Olcott has also introduced a charming sequence in which the background is a garden party. In this episode an indulgent and loquacious duchess furnishes some amusement. Dorothy Dunbar gives a creditable performance as Lady Cleone. Gardner James is effective as Ronald Barrymaine, and Nigel Barrie is capable as Sir Mortimer.

‘Apollo 11’ Review: The 1969 Moon Mission Still Has the Power to Thrill - The New York Times,"The documentary “Apollo 11,” directed and edited by Todd Douglas Miller, is entirely awe-inspiring. Which is something of a surprise. As world events of the 20th century go, Apollo 11, the NASA mission of 1969 that put two men on the moon, has been thoroughly documented. It’s also been fictionally dissected, most recently by Damien Chazelle, whose 2018 film, “First Man,” is a portrait of Neil Armstrong, the mission’s commander and, yes, the first man to walk on the moon. In addition to chronicling that triumph, that film examines Armstrong’s emotional reticence. Miller’s documentary indirectly points out why such a quality is valued in astronauts. Beginning with the shots of a crawler-transporter hauling the Saturn V rocket to the Cape Canaveral launch pad, and Walter Cronkite’s newscast oratory providing the only overt narrative setup the movie will avail itself of, “Apollo 11” dispassionately lays out just how many things needed to go exactly right for this mission to be accomplished. And as many of the things that could possibly go wrong, the movie also implies that it’s only giving you the tip of the iceberg in that respect. The film consists primarily of newly discovered archival footage, some of which has never been seen before in a film. But Miller doesn’t rely entirely on it. He uses simple but effective white-on-black graphics, graphic animations and, occasionally, footage set up in split-screen to highlight particularly harrowing maneuvers, to convey the complications of the actions the Apollo 11 crew had to so precisely execute. The impact is nearly mind-boggling. On the return-to-earth leg of the journey the crew cuts loose a little more, listening to a weightless cassette player from which emits the folk-country tune “Mother Country” by John Stewart. Recordings from Houston’s mission control track key moments, including the heart rates of Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins at crucial junctures during the eight-day mission. At launch, according to the flight surgeon’s report, Armstrong’s heart rate is up to 110 beats per minute. Collins’s is at 99, while Aldrin, cool as a cucumber, has a rate of 88. “First Man” reminded viewers of the complex physical and emotional challenges that come from work as an astronaut. And “Apollo 11” further demonstrates that hardly anyone but an aerospace engineer and a voluminous support team can get close to doing the math required for this endeavor. For all that, “Apollo 11” is not entirely devoid of romance. Although we know how the mission turns out, the movie generates and maintains suspense. And it rekindles a crazy sense of wonder at, among other things, what one can do practically with trigonometry.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/movies/apollo-11-review.html
"‘Apollo 18,’ Directed by Gonzalo López-Gallego - Review - The New York Times","we’re told that everything we see comes from a trove of 84 hours of NASA film discovered online — the film purports to document a final, secret manned mission to the Moon in 1974, two years after Apollo 17. It doesn’t explain how the thunderous launching of a Saturn V rocket went unnoticed, or (spoiler alert!) why another nation put a man on the lunar surface without bothering to tell anyone. (It’s also not clear why the cache of film includes happy preflight scenes of the three American astronauts at a backyard barbecue.)The movie, the first English-language feature by the Spanish director Gonzalo López-Gallego, quickly transports the men to the Moon, then settles in for a series of familiar bump-in-the-night scares as they set up equipment, gather scientific samples and exchange stilted personal anecdotes during downtime inside the lunar lander. They are not alone, of course — they have company, both human and otherwise — and soon they’re battling predatory creatures and a vast cover-up. Some effort has been expended to recreate the look of the grainy, jumpy images that were miraculously beamed back to terrestrial televisions during the Apollo flights, but little imagination went toward using that format in the service of an entertaining story or any genuine suspense. All we get is the low-level tension of strange noises, flickering lights and shock cuts; when the monsters appear, they’re so sketchy, whether by design or from lack of budget, that you can’t believe you’ve waited around to see them. The coy marketing campaign for “Apollo 18,” in which everyone involved insisted that the film was a documentary about an actual space flight, went to the extreme of never crediting the actors, and even on screen they are named late in the closing credits and not identified by their roles. (The closing credits also contain one of the movie’s wittier touches: they’re set to an instrumental version of “We Three Kings.”)For the record, the astronauts are portrayed in workmanlike fashion by three television veterans: Warren Christie (currently in “Alphas”), Lloyd Owen (“Monarch of the Glen”) and Ryan Robbins (“Sanctuary”). In retrospect, they may be glad to leave this one off their résumés. “Apollo 18” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A few scares, a few bad words. APOLLO 18Opened on Friday nationwide. Directed by Gonzalo López-Gallego; written by Brian Miller and Cory Goodman; produced by Timur Bekmambetov and Michele Wolkoff; released by Dimension Films. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes.

"FILM REVIEW; 'Apollo 13,' a Movie for the Fourth of July - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from June 30, 1995, Section C, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. THE line of dialogue that will be best remembered from Ron Howard's absolutely thrilling new ""Apollo 13"" is a slight variation on the truth. ""Houston, we have a problem,"" says one of this film's three endangered astronauts, although ""Houston, we've had a problem"" is what Jim Lovell actually said. It's a small but important change, one more way that ""Apollo 13"" unfolds with perfect immediacy, drawing viewers into the nail-biting suspense of a spellbinding true story. You can know every glitch that made this such a dangerous mission, and ""Apollo 13"" will still have you by the throat. Better even than Mr. Howard's sure hand with this fascinating material is his film's unexpected restraint. ""Apollo 13"" understands the difference between movie bravado and real courage, and it celebrates the latter in inspiring ways that have almost gone out of style. With Tom Hanks, wonderful again, as the Everyman in the driver's seat, ""Apollo 13"" isn't afraid of the stone-cold fear at the heart of this tale or of the intricate group effort needed to see it through. This film and its brave, believable characters are uplifting in ways that have nothing to do with a voyage to outer space. We take it for granted today that there have been a hundred manned American space flights, and that an astronaut can remain in orbit almost unnoticed for a three-month stretch. But the weeklong adventure of the Apollo 13 crew unfolded in a very different atmosphere. In April 1970, the space program still aroused strong emotions: attention had begun to wane after the previous year's moon walk, but the nation found itself desperately receptive to the astronauts' unforeseen display of heroism after their flight became so perilous. ""Apollo 13"" doesn't mention Vietnam, but it doesn't have to. The war-weary climate of that time enhances this film's wishful, stirring faith in American know-how. Like ""Quiz Show,"" ""Apollo 13"" beautifully evokes recent history in ways that resonate strongly today. Cleverly nostalgic in its visual style (Rita Ryack's costumes are especially right), it harks back to movie making without phony heroics and to the strong spirit of community that enveloped the astronauts and their families. Amazingly, this film manages to seem refreshingly honest while still conforming to the three-act dramatic format of a standard Hollywood hit. It is far and away the best thing Mr. Howard has done (and ""Far and Away"" was one of the other kind). Equally sound was casting his own mother (Jean Speegle Howard) as Jim Lovell's mother, a real corker. ""Are you boys in the space program, too?"" she sweetly asks the film's Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong.""Apollo 13"" makes it unsurprising that Jim Lovell (""no stranger to emergencies he,"" a television commentator says) would come from sturdy stock. Mr. Lovell is presented as a quietly gung-ho commander, the kind of man who tells his wife (played brightly and affectingly by Kathleen Quinlan) that he's going to the moon as if that's great news. For Mr. Lovell, on whose memoir, ""Lost Moon"" (written with Jeffrey Kluger), the film is based, it actually was: he had come tantalizingly close to the moon on the Apollo 8 flight and enthusiastically looked forward to a lunar landing. Instead, on a mission whose original flight plan was abruptly aborted, he was lucky to come home alive. The science behind ""Apollo 13"" is detailed and specific, and the film conveys it with superb simplicity. Easy as it would have been to sling showy high-tech jargon, the screenplay (credited to William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert) is gratifyingly terse and clear. With a pitch-perfect ear for NASA syntax (""Come on, rookie, park that thing""), the film stays informative while dealing with arcane facts that became matters of life and death. You may see no more dazzling display of ingenuity all year than the authentic way the film's NASA technicians scramble with cardboard and duct tape to make a square peg fit a round hole. In terms of realism, nothing else here comes close to the staggering fact that some of the film's zero-gravity scenes were shot aboard a KC-135 NASA plane on a steep parabolic orbit that earned it the nickname ""vomit comet."" Some may feel that Mr. Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton, who play the astronauts so expertly, deserve something better than the usual end-of-the-year recognition for having even taken these roles. These three stars (and their terrific backup teammates on the ground, especially Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, an astronaut benched at the last minute because of a measles scare, and Ed Harris as the nail-spitting flight commander, Gene Kranz) capture an extraordinary verisimilitude. No film about space travel has done a more realistic job of conveying the strangeness and exhilaration of such exploits, not to mention the terror summed up by Mr. Bacon's Jack Swigert: ""If this doesn't work, we're not going to have the power to get home.""Crippled by the explosion of one of its oxygen tanks as it neared the moon, the spaceship Odyssey experienced sudden electrical failures that forced the astronauts to shut it down. They took refuge in their lunar exploration module, the Aquarius, which was neither built nor programmed to bring three men back to earth. Computer readjustments, navigational problems, lack of heat in space, fear of incineration on re-entry, condensation that made the flight ""a little like trying to drive a toaster through a car wash"": all these troubles are grippingly dealt with in cinematically unconventional ways. When the guys in this film frantically get out their slide rules, they're executing a gutsier rescue than the maneuvers of any cape-wearing cartoon superhero. Thanks largely to Mr. Hanks' foursquare presence here, the empathy factor for ""Apollo 13"" is through the roof. This actor's way of amplifying the ordinary side of an extraordinary character remains supremely fine-tuned. Playing the tough, commanding Jim Lovell is a substantial stretch for Mr. Hanks, but as usual his seeming ingenuousness overshadows all else about the role. There's not a false move to anything he does on screen. Once again, he gives a performance that looks utterly natural and is, in fact, subtly new. The other principal performances are equally staunch, giving vivid, likable impressions of characters whose rough edges have been only slightly smoothed. (The fact that Gene Kranz liked to start his day listening to John Philip Sousa marches, as reported in Andrew Chaikin's lucid Apollo overview, ""A Man on the Moon,"" is the kind of thing not dealt with by Mr. Harris's tight, steely performance.)Also notable about ""Apollo 13"": James Horner's rousing music, convincing rocket scenes that don't come from NASA and an authentic glimpse of the role of television reporting during the Apollo crisis. The news media can be faulted for some of the behavior seen here, but Mr. Howard doesn't waste time taking those potshots. Truly, ""Apollo 13"" has better things to do.""Apollo 13"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes very mild profanity and very brief sexual situations. Children old enough to follow its story should love it -- and they'll find out how to go to the bathroom in space.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. HONEST clansmen and corrupt aristocrats lock horns across the windswept Scottish terrain during ""Rob Roy,"" but for now let's talk about kilts. Liam Neeson, sporting the tartan of the MacGregors, swaggers so nobly and manfully across the landscape that he shows off the kilt as the legitimate power suit of the Highlands. While ushering in a spring fashion trendlet that will also feature Mel Gibson (whose ""Braveheart"" is on the horizon), Mr. Neeson brings to mind another Mel. It's Brooks, and he's out of luck: at least ""Rob Roy"" is no ""Men in Tights"" in the making. Instead, ""Rob Roy"" gives Mr. Neeson his first cinematic opportunity to show off the robust physicality that made his performance on stage in ""Anna Christie"" such a sensation. Along with the presence of Jessica Lange, who plays the sauciest mate in all Scotland, that charisma partly compensates for long, dry stretches of ""Rob Roy"" and a plot too ponderous and uninteresting for the film's visual sweep. So ""Rob Roy"" is best watched for local color and for its hearty, hot-blooded stars. Speaking of which, Ms. Lange may be the screen's first actress to slide her hand under the kilt of a leading man.""You know how fine ye are to me, Robert MacGregor?"" asks Mary (Ms. Lange), showing off the lilting dialogue that is one of the film's incidental charms. After a Brooks-worthy prologue during which the MacGregor men scare off snaggle-toothed livestock thieves, ""Rob Roy"" settles in for a rosy section that highlights such domestic bliss. The MacGregors are presented as simple country clansmen who extol honor, pay their debts in rabbits, dance jigs and roast their dinner on open fires. There's time for Rob and Mary to make love on a hilltop, and for Mr. Neeson to visit the local Loch and generate a discreet skinny-dipping scene. All this is a far cry from the dour-looking Scottish drover who was the real Rob Roy, immortalized by Sir Walter Scott in a dense, dialect-heavy volume that makes the movie look effervescent by comparison. A legend in his own land, with a nickname referring to his red hair, Rob Roy became an outlaw after failing to repay his debt to the Marquis of Montrose. He was celebrated for his bravado and his heroics in eluding capture. But the film doesn't convey much sense of why he should matter to modern viewers, who may know less about Rob Roy the folk hero than Rob Roy the drink. Which is why it's handy that Mr. Neeson strides so impressively, acts so forcefully and towers over every other man in sight. As directed by Michael Caton-Jones, whose diverse earlier films (""Doc Hollywood,"" ""Scandal,"" ""Memphis Belle,"" ""This Boy's Life"") have virtually no links to this one, ""Rob Roy"" seems to have envisioned its villains with Mr. Neeson's imposing machismo in mind. They are small, fussy and fey, and when all three of them confront Rob Roy in a formal garden, he's a head taller than everyone. Unlike his adversaries, he also has the good grace not to be wearing a curled wig or (in one case) baby-blue breeches. Wickedest among the heavies is Cunningham, played by Tim Roth as a coy, insinuating fop who doubles as both courtier to the Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt) and a surreptitious wench-chaser. ""Love is a dunghill, Betty, and I am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow,"" he informs one such conquest. The film tries its hardest to lend a lusty, sometimes scatological edge to such goings-on, which means the audience is treated to a scene featuring Cunningham and his chamber-pot. And Mr. Roth (last seen, worlds away, as the stick-up man in ""Pulp Fiction"") does his malevolent best with this role, even if the film relies too heavily on him to provide some personality. Whether flirting slyly with Montrose or showing off his skills as a rapist and assassin, Mr. Roth's Cunningham does succeed in galvanizing the audience. Prissy costumes show off his savagery to nicely perverse effect. With Mr. Hurt properly regal and wise beneath his tricornered hat, and Brian Cox delicately sinister as one of his henchmen, ""Rob Roy"" is poised for a battle of wills between pampered nobility and a ruffian folk hero. But Mr. Caton-Jones and Alan Sharp, who wrote the screenplay, let some of the film's biggest confrontations go slack. The film's final confrontation, a sword fight, starts out suspensefully and then just falls flat. And a sequence showing the ambush of one of Rob Roy's men is too fancily intercut with another scene. (The victim is Eric Stoltz, who seems to have been cast here solely on the basis of native diffidence and red hair.)One of the story's strongest scenes finds Cunningham attacking Mary MacGregor, arriving by boat at her cottage in an outfit worthy of Captain Hook. So vicious that he punches, drags and then rapes her with perfect indifference, Mr. Roth gives the sequence all the nastiness it requires. And Ms. Lange, who has occasional dazzling moments here, displays great dignity mixed with raw, barely contained emotion. It's a scene that calls for cowboy justice, for the loner who avenges affronts and defends his loved ones' honor. Rob Roy, too often lost amid this sprawling epic, makes most sense as a cowboy hero. Kilt and all.""Rob Roy"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, violence, sexual references and scatological detail.

ROB ROY' OPENS AT CRITERION; Walt Disney Drama Moves in Angry Pursuits Among the Misty Scottish Hills - The New York Times,"very colorful and assertive, but cutouts just the same. Others fill in very patly as clansmen or subjects of the Crown. What you can look for, however, is a fine lot of fighting among the hills, shooting of rifles, banging of claymores, skirling of pipes and buzzing of burrs, filmed and recorded in color on the actual Scottish countryside. And while Mr. Todd is not precisely the Rob Roy that history records, he is indeed a satisfactory fabrication until a better Rob Roy comes along. Also on the bill is that section from the old Walt Disney picture, ""Melody Time,"" which has to do with the adventures of the fabulous Pecos Bill. This whimsey in cartoon and live-action—the latter featuring Roy Rogers and his horse—is a grand piece of Disney fun-making and is well worth revival in its present form.

BATMAN FOREVER"" brings on the very secular sensation that you are part of something larger than yourself. Toys, games, comics, videos: each has its place in the cosmos of this multimedia phenomenon, and the consumer's role is no less well-defined. As for the actual movie, it's the empty-calorie equivalent of a Happy Meal (another Batman tie-in), so clearly a product that the question of its cinematic merit is strictly an afterthought. More to the point is its title, a proud affirmation that the venture is still flop-proof. ""Batman Forever"" is both a threat and a promise. And ""Batman Forever"" is a viable installment in the ""Batman"" series, though Joel Schumacher's flashy direction is messier and less interestingly macabre than Tim Burton's darkly ingenious films in this genre. Mr. Schumacher favors vertiginous angles that turn into overkill during his film's awkward action sequences, but he's better when it comes to displaying the contents of Batman's closet. Pandering more directly to a teen-age audience than either ""Batman"" or ""Batman Returns"" did, this third film also dwells on sophomoric wisecracks. Like this: ""You trying to get under my cape?""Serious audiences will be less interested than ever in what's under Batman's cape or cowl. There's not much to contemplate here beyond the spectacle of gimmicky props and the kitsch of good actors (all of whom have lately done better work elsewhere) dressed for a red-hot Halloween. The prime costume is now worn by Val Kilmer, who makes a good Batman but not a better one than Michael Keaton, and is just as hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role. High on the list of innovations we didn't need to see this year: nipples on Batman's redesigned rubber suit. If that's how ""Batman Forever"" means to announce a more interesting Batman, it doesn't work. Neither do flashbacks to Bruce Wayne's childhood brush with the dark, winged side of his nature (i.e., a real bat) at the time of his parents' death. For all the money and talent that have gone into bringing ""Batman"" to the screen, this is still just a live-action comic strip hero with a lot more black-tie evenings on his calender than Superman had. Only by virtue of his Bruce Wayne-Batman dichotomy does he qualify as a two-dimensional character. Since Batman always needs some backup in the personality department, he has two colorful new antagonists this time: Two-Face, the walking makeup marvel (Tommy Lee Jones), and the Riddler, played to the hilt by Jim Carrey in scene-stealing high gear. Mr. Carrey is the only performer in ""Batman Forever"" who is right in his element, frantically campy and reveling in wildly jokey effects. ""Caffeine'll KILL ya,"" he exclaims, clobbering someone with a coffee pot. All dimples and insane glee, he can magically sap the malice out of a moment like that. While it would be nice to see him play something other than a nerd venting psychotic spite, that does seem to be Mr. Carrey's frequent strong suit. And he's great fun here, channeling every ounce of malevolent energy into ruining Batman's day, or declaring his intention to become ""Gotham's cleverest carbon-based life form."" Incidentally, his riddles ultimately turn out to be as tricky as some of the math problems tossed into ""Die Hard With a Vengeance,"" the ones that are supposedly solved on the run by a bomb-dodging Samuel L. Jackson. Who says the kids aren't learning anything this summer?They'll be learning a few extras from the Batman-Robin relationship, which has been revived to bolster this film. What with everyone's skintight superhero clothes, Bruce Wayne's remarkable interest in becoming the guardian of handsome young Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell) and the mutual interest these two share in Bruce's motorcycles, ""Batman Forever"" is the most sexually ambiguous of the three films. On a very different note, Mr. Carrey also turns up in one scene sporting a diamond tiara. Batman's heterosexuality is staunchly emphasized by Nicole Kidman's svelte, double-entendre-slinging presence as Dr. Chase Meridian. This psychiatrist, whose looks are as striking as her name, starts out trying to analyze Batman and winds up in nicely confused romances with both him and Bruce Wayne, his alter ego. As an added bonus, Dr. Meridian is around to call out ""Don't work too late!"" to Batman and Robin in the film's final scene. That's in case anyone wonders whether Warner Brothers has thought about a sequel.(Mr. Schumacher has said that Warner's top executives spoke of Batman as ""the company's largest asset"" when they offered him this directing job.)With a cast that also includes Michael Gough's own brand of heroism in the role of Alfred, Bruce Wayne's long-suffering butler, ""Batman Forever"" centers on the Riddler's invention of a brainwashing device that can implant or withdraw holographic images, which in one demonstration look like three-dimensional fish swimming out of a television screen. (The six-year-old in my company, being much closer to the optimum age for a fan of this third ""Batman,"" described it better: ""The Riddler made up IMAX."")Armed with this and abetted by Two-Face, the Riddler would surely succeed in capturing every gargoyle in Gotham City if this film's three credited screenwriters (Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman) weren't under some obligation to give Batman a fighting edge. Mr. Schumacher makes the mistake of opening ""Batman Forever"" in mid-turmoil. But the film recovers from that initial confusion to get stronger as it goes along, and to shape up as a free-form playground for its various masquerading stars. Like Mr. Jones, an actor as divided as Two-Face, who is this time in his shrill mode from ""Natural Born Killers"" rather than the lean, mean persona he brings to better roles. Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar turn up occasionally to vamp by his side. Mr. Kilmer makes a muted, whispery Batman at first, but he develops more dash as the story unfolds. Perhaps daunted by the job of protecting Gotham City, he should be relieved to know the place isn't as dangerous as it looks. Gotham is now a few shades brighter and less forbidding, as befits the Happy Meal ambitions of ""Batman Forever."" When Robin leaves the Batmobile running during one sequence, nobody even steals his toy.""Batman Forever"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Though it includes violence, profanity and obvious sexual innuendoes, it's somewhat more suitable for children than the earlier films in this series. BATMAN FOREVER Directed by Joel Schumacher; written by Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman, from a story by Mr. Batchler and Ms. Scott Batchler, based on the characters created by Bob Kane and published by DC Comics; director of photography, Stephen Goldblatt; edited by Dennis Virkler; music by Elliot Goldenthal; production designer, Barbara Ling; produced by Tim Burton and Peter MacGregor-Scott; released by Warner Brothers.

FILM REVIEW; Sad Tourist Trapped In Burma - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from August 25, 1995, Section C, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. There are two heroines in ""Beyond Rangoon,"" a film with a shrewd double vision. One heroine, based on a real-life woman, becomes an ethereal, legendary presence hovering over the film. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese democratic leader who was placed under house arrest for six years and won the Nobel Peace Prize, gives the film its purpose, though she appears in only one scene (played by Adelle Lutz). The fictional heroine, appearing in almost every scene, is Laura Bowman (Patricia Arquette). She is an American tourist caught in the chaos and violence of Burma in 1988, when the military cracked down on Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and the democracy movement, and declared martial law. When Laura wanders into the lush, overgrown countryside, she finds herself the target of soldiers ready to shoot her on sight. John Boorman's film is determined to be both a thriller with commercial possibilities and, that least fashionable of genres, a serious political film. Amazingly, this hybrid works. ""Beyond Rangoon"" gets off to a slow, worrisome start, but it soon becomes an elegant, fierce, absorbing movie. The script is based on one written before 1988, when Burma became known as Myanmar, and it is still possible to see the seams where the old thriller and the new political concerns are gracefully sewn together. Laura Bowman is a woman with an overload of problems. She is a lapsed doctor who has come to Burma to try to get over the murder of her husband and small son; in excruciating, mercifully brief flashbacks, she recalls discovering their bodies in pools of blood. She is accompanied on the trip by her sister (Frances McDormand), who is also a doctor, and by a hyperkinetic tour guide, played by a scene-stealing Spalding Gray. As the sightseers wander around a giant stone Buddha, Ms. Arquette says in voice-over: ""I stared at the stone faces but nothing stirred in me. I am a stone myself."" Her face is already so stony this is information no one needs to be told. But after this sluggish, heavy-handed opening, the film arrives at its dramatic and eloquent central scene. Leaving her hotel alone at night, Laura happens across a demonstration in which soldiers are ready to fire into the crowd. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi walks serenely toward the soldiers pointing guns at her; one soldier is so moved and astonished his gun shakes in his hand; they let her pass. (This is based on a real event, in which she walked toward soldiers ordered to shoot; the film does not make it clear that a higher officer rescinded the order.)In this scene the lives of the two heroines, and the two threads of the film, blend beautifully. Laura is eager to see a peaceful woman face down the guns; she needs to believe that such brave pacifism can conquer violence. Here and throughout the film, it is impossible to overstate the importance of the subtle, delicate score by Hans Zimmer (who did very different work on ""The Lion King""). The music, with its evocative recurring melody played on the flute, keeps the film balanced this side of preaching, and sets the tone for both the idealism and the intense action that follows. From that point on, the film gains momentum. Laura has lost her passport and must stay in the city of Rangoon when the rest of her group leaves. The film becomes better without the other Americans, and without Laura's intrusive voice-over. A woman with nothing to lose, she agrees to follow an illegal guide into the countryside beyond Rangoon, and is caught there when martial law is declared. Laura discovers that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's inspirational act will not conquer violence as easily as she had hoped. Laura's guide, a fictional character named U Aung Ko (played by an actor with the same name), has been an advocate of democracy. He and his friends are now hunted by the military, and Laura finds it impossible to abandon them. Gentle and wise, Aung Ko becomes the film's third heroic character. As written, his character too bluntly represents the courage and wisdom of his country and culture, but the actor's naturalness gives him a human dimension and makes his friendship with Laura credible. The politics are lucid and greatly simplified here, the better to send Laura and Aung Ko on a chase toward the Thai border and freedom. They make a long, dangerous struggle through the countryside and on the river, with soldiers everywhere. Ms. Arquette gives a tough, accomplished performance that allows Laura's fear and her increasing strength to emerge. Mr. Boorman's work has ranged from the solid and straightforward (""Deliverance,"" ""Hope and Glory"") to the flaky (""Where the Heart Is""), but it is always ambitious. ""Beyond Rangoon"" is one of his most solid works. Even when the script overstates Laura's qualities (it is, in the end, too much that she is a doctor), Mr. Boorman is in command of a story that ranges from private conversations to crowds rampaging outside the United States Embassy. John Seale's photography is as smooth or as quick as the situation demands. And Mr. Boorman and Ms. Arquette maintain their dual focus on Laura's personal journey and her political awakening inspired by Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi (who was released from house arrest just last month, long after the movie was completed). ""Beyond Rangoon"" is a rare film, one that is intelligent, emotional and exciting.""Beyond Rangoon"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes much violence, including cold-blooded killings by soldiers. BEYOND RANGOON Directed by John Boorman; written by Alex Lasker and Bill Rubenstein; director of photography, John Seale; edited by Ron Davis; music by Hans Zimmer; production designer, Anthony Pratt; produced by Barry Spikings, Eric Pleskow and Mr. Boorman; released by Castle Rock Entertainment.

When they finished shooting ""Smoke,"" Paul Auster and Wayne Wang were in no hurry to pack up and go home. And Mr. Auster wasn't even far from home, since the Brooklyn Cigar Company, the Park Slope store in which much of ""Smoke"" was set, is part of the neighborhood in which he lives, the one ""Smoke"" observed so fondly. So they stayed in the store. They invited celebrities to drop by. They let the camera roll for long takes without interruption. Showing the actors signs that read ""Boring!"" or ""Get to the Point"" or ""2 Minute Warning"" was as close as Mr. Wang and Mr. Auster came to directing ""Blue in the Face,"" their new cinematic accessory to ""Smoke."" ""Blue in the Face"" got its title because the actors, it was said jokingly, were free to talk until they reached that point. Some joke: this thing could have been a nightmare. Instead, it's good-humored, try-anything fun.""Blue in the Face"" should not be confused with one of those films that has a beginning, middle and end or is in any great rush to move from one stage to the next. What it has instead is an easygoing, copacetic mood and a playfulness in which the audience can take part. The film winks broadly whenever improvisations start looking like outtakes (""Well?"" ""Well what?"") or the occasional wild card appears. Among the latter are RuPaul giving a brief dancing lesson and Madonna dressed to deliver a singing telegram, not a minute too early for Halloween. Harvey Keitel once again makes a fine master of ceremonies at the cigar store, presiding over the antics and looking genuinely amused by much of what he sees. Mr. Keitel's sportsmanship even extends to being grabbed in a hammerlock and kissed by Roseanne, who delivers one of the film's few dismal turns by straining instead of just letting things happen. Roseanne also screeches and chews gum furiously, neither of which suits the film's laid-back mood. Most of the performers who come off to best effect here take the coolest possible approach to what they're doing. So Lou Reed, who sings about egg creams on the film's energetic soundtrack, stands behind the counter and explains his eyeglasses, also trying to recall an early smoking experience. (""It, along with most of my childhood memories, are not available to me,"" he says.) In the same mood, Jim Jarmusch shows up not only as the patron saint of this type of film making but also as someone about to smoke what he says is his last cigarette. ""I never had a girlfriend who didn't smoke,"" he muses. ""Maybe if I quit I'll never have sex again."" He doesn't look worried. Also here are Lily Tomlin, as a man with chest hair, talking about how badly she wants a Belgian waffle; John Lurie, lounging comfortably in the street and providing background music; Michael J. Fox, pleasantly asking rude personal questions; and Malik Yoba as a rapper who spars nicely with Mr. Keitel's lovable Augie. Sometimes, as when Mr. Yoba starts delivering a kind of folk-rap, music breaks out spontaneously. Victor Argo, as the store owner, takes the cake for this with a song of his own invention. The store's hangers-on, including Giancarlo Esposito, join in to sing: ""Girls like you are a dime a dozen, and I got a nickel to spend.""The occasional shrill note (Mel Gorham as a loud Latin spitfire) is more than offset by casual thoughts about Ebbets Field, plastic bags in Prospect Park (from the writer Ian Frazier), Jackie Robinson's ghost (played by Keith David) and the way Nazis in movies hold their cigarettes. There's also a claim that Brooklyn is the hippest borough. And if ""Blue in the Face"" is any indication, then it's true. BLUE IN THE FACE Directed by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster; situations created by Mr. Wang and Mr. Auster in collaboration with the actors; director of photography, Adam Holender; edited by Christopher Tellefsen; music by John Lurie, Calvin Weston and Billy Martin; production designer, Kalina Ivanov; produced by Greg Johnson, Peter Newman and Diana Phillips; released by Miramax Films.

FILM REVIEW; America's Cold War With Canada. Just Kidding! - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from September 22, 1995, Section C, Page 20Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. When the President of the United States decides that starting a cold war with Canada would be the most efficient way to boost his sagging popularity, the news media have a field day promoting a campaign called Operation Canadian Bacon: A Line in the Snow. Overnight the term ""Canuck"" acquires the same sinister connotations that were once attached to ""Commie."" A newscaster points to a map of the United States with maple syrup dripping over Montana and Minnesota and mutters darkly about the evil seeping across the border. Everything from Canada's use of the metric system to Neil Young and Anne Murray is identified as part of a conspiracy to destroy America. The notion of a phony war with Canada concocted to distract the United States from its economic woes is the amusing premise behind ""Canadian Bacon,"" a satire of American yahooism that aspires to be the 90's answer to ""Dr. Strangelove."" The film, written and directed by Michael Moore, goes after the selling of the Persian Gulf war and similar adventures with the same freewheeling glee with which Mr. Moore ridiculed General Motors in his popular documentary ""Roger and Me.""While it's refreshing to find Hollywood producing a political satire with bite in these cautiously conservative times, ""Canadian Bacon"" is much sharper in its comic details than in its overall scheme. And along the way, the parody becomes so broad that the movie loses its edge and collapses into farce. In its disappointing final third, it clings to the hackneyed Hollywood formula of a race against the clock to prevent nuclear Armageddon. Where the ending of ""Dr. Strangelove"" went over the brink, ""Canadian Bacon"" plays it safe. As ""Roger and Me"" suggested, Mr. Moore has a problem with all authority figures, and so it's no surprise that his new film's major characters are all either villains or fools or both. Alan Alda's President is a grinning, poll-obsessed cipher who flails around the Oval Office begging his staff for advice. When he gives an address, the words come out slightly twisted. ""It's time to turn off the war machine and turn on our children,"" he announces in one speech. His national security adviser, Stu Smiley (Kevin Pollak), is the personification of duplicitous yuppie evil; his chief military adviser, Gen. Dick Panzer (Rip Torn), a jibbering, cigar-chomping warmonger. The film's most dastardly character is R. J. Hacker (G. D. Spradlin), a weapons manufacturer who smokes foot-long cigars, speaks with a Southern twang and is the only person who knows the computer codes to operate a doomsday machine known as the Hacker Hellstorm. The accidental and unworthy heroes of Operation Canadian Bacon are Bud B. Boomer (John Candy, in his second-to-last screen role), the bumbling sheriff of Niagara County on the Canadian border, and his gun-crazed sidekick, Deputy Honey (Rhea Perlman). Bud becomes a national hero when he leads a rescue operation to find Honey, whom he left stranded across the border after a previous foray. The American propaganda machine has seized on Honey as the war's first ""hostage.""On his way to Toronto, which Bud mistakenly insists is the country's capital, he is stopped by an excessively polite policeman who informs him that the law requires that the graffiti on his truck (""Canucks Are Dog Meat"" is one of the milder slogans) must be printed in French as well as in English. The movie is so busy spearing the dragons of American aggression that its cartoonish vision of Canadians as wimpy Pollyannas has little resonance. If ""Canadian Bacon"" finally comes apart at the seams, it has enough comic asides to keep liberal funny bones tickled.""Canadian Bacon"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some vulgar language. CANADIAN BACON Written and directed by Michael Moore; director of photography, Haskell Wexler; edited by Wendey Stanzler and Michael Berenbaum; music by Elmer Bernstein and Peter Bernstein; production designer, Carol Spier; produced by Mr. Moore, David Brown and Ron Rotholz; released by Gramercy Pictures. Running time: 110 minutes. This film is rated PG. WITH: Alan Alda (President), John Candy (Bud B. Boomer), Rhea Perlman (Deputy Honey), Kevin Pollak (Stu Smiley), Rip Torn (Gen. Dick Panzer) and G.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. It is Christmas Eve in a twinkling snow-wrapped New England cottage. Rachel (Mia Farrow), an angelically perky housewife and mother of two boys, snuggles in bed with her husband, Tom (Tony Goldwyn), to the comforting groan of Bing Crosby crooning ""I'll Be Home for Christmas."" She is so smitten with the holiday spirit, she chirps, that she is about to have a ""euphoria attack.""Suddenly Tom bursts into sobs. He has become so fed up with her high-pitched nattering, he confesses, that he has taken a contract out on her life. To save herself she must flee at once. Moments later, Tom bundles his protesting wife out of a second-story window, from which she slides down the roof into the snow in her flannel nightgown and slippers and stumbles off into the blizzard. Rachel's sudden expulsion from her dream world is the first of many shocks delivered by ""Reckless,"" a surreal comic allegory that suggests ""Alice in Wonderland"" fused with ""Candide"" into a contemporary antidote to Frank Capra's holiday heartwarmer ""It's a Wonderful Life.""Adapted by Craig Lucas from his successful Off Broadway play, and directed by his longtime collaborator, Norman Rene, ""Reckless"" is a remarkably pure and satisfying transposition from theater to film. When at the end of her journey, years later, a much sadder and wiser Rachel encounters a figure from her previous life, only the most stone-hearted moviegoer will not be moved to tears. Routed from her nest, Rachel ends up spending Christmas with Lloyd (Scott Glenn), a kindly stranger who plucks her out of the night and brings her home to Pooty (Mary-Louise Parker), his deaf, mute, paraplegic wife, whom he attends with a saintly devotion. Lloyd is a social worker for Hands Across the Sea, a charity for the disabled. And Rachel not only ends up living with Lloyd and Pooty, but working for the organization. Although at first Rachel's rescuers appear to be flesh-and-blood Christmas angels, they are not exactly what they seem. Out of the blue one day, Lloyd casually informs Rachel that he has fled an earlier life in which he destroyed and then abandoned what was left of his family. Rachel also learns that Lloyd and Pooty's domestic bliss is based on a profound deception perpetrated by Pooty. The trio's illusory tranquillity is finally shattered on their second Christmas together, when a lethal gift arrives on the doorstep. Rachel and Lloyd suddenly find themselves fugitives in an odyssey that carries them across America through a series of indistinguishable towns all named Springfield. On the road, Lloyd reverts to his former monstrous self. And after one too many disasters, Rachel herself loses the power of speech and ends up in a shelter for the homeless tended by Sister Margaret (Eileen Brennan), a gung-ho nun who carries her own guilty secrets. Mr. Lucas's screenplay, which has hardly changed from the play, poses deeply unsettling questions about American life and the popular myths that provide us with a sense of rootedness, continuity and direction. One is the notion of home sweet home, the belief that a place of ultimate refuge and security really does exist in an age when homelessness is a spreading social pathology. Another is the peculiarly American notion of self-invention. In an era when public criminals routinely turn their backs on the past by conspicuously adopting religion, how do people reconcile their pasts with their reinvented selves? Or don't they? Does a psychic sense of well-being depend on a willed moral amnesia?As Rachel slowly awakens from her fairy-tale dream of life, the screenplay offers two sharply opposing views of time and memory. ""The past is something we wake up from,"" Rachel optimistically declares early in the film. But she later comes to believe that ""the past is a nightmare we wake up to.""All these thoughts are addressed in an unusually cheery tone by characters who spend very little time looking back with regret. That deliberately artificial tone, which suggests a generalized spiritual anesthesia, is matched by the film's fantastical look. Rachel's New England cottage and the hills and roads around it resemble an oversize doll house plunked down inside a toy landscape. At the same time, it all looks just real enough to be more than a cute little stage set.""Reckless"" sustains the darkly zany atmosphere of a grown-up fairy tale far more successfully than ""Prelude to a Kiss,"" the director's earlier screen transposition of a Lucas play. But that doesn't make it easy. Audiences conditioned to expect conventional movie naturalism should be warned that ""Reckless"" is surreally stylized in its writing and production design and even in some of its acting. Ms. Farrow is so perfectly cast as Rachel that the character seems a distillation of nearly every role she has played since she was a teen-ager in ""Peyton Place."" With her peaches-and-cream complexion and slightly whiny voice, Ms. Farrow has always epitomized a precocious, overgrown princess whose garrulity inspires protectiveness tinged with irritation. In ""Reckless,"" projecting a mixture of the sweetly forlorn and the intractably childish, she is nothing less than American innocence incarnate demanding to be snapped out of it.""Reckless"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.'Quartet' star explores film's many strings.''BASILEUS QUARTET,'' which has been playing at Lincoln Plaza I for the last month, opens today in California, and a lot of other states. So one of its stars, the 28-year-old Pierre Malet, has come to the United States to take a look around. He thinks it's a nice place to visit, but he wouldn't want to live here. ''It's a too- big country for me,'' he says. ''It's six hours flying if you want to go to Los Angeles from New York. In France, everything is human distance, for human beings.''Mr. Malet was born in a little village near St.-Tropez, but much of his life has been spent in Paris. ''My stepfather, Norbert Carbonnaux, is a movie director,'' he says, ''and I used to be on the set, hanging around, doing extra parts. My twin brother, Laurent, is an actor; he started before me. So when I decided to do the same job, with Laurent already in the business, all my friends were telling me it was suicide. Because one of the most important qualities of an actor is being unique.'' But, Mr. Malet says, even if he and his brother do look alike, ''We don't have the same temperament.'' ''Basileus Quartet,'' which has not appeared in Paris movie houses (it was shown on television in an uncut, three-hour version) tells what happens when the first violinist of a famous string quartet dies and is replaced by a 22-year-old prodigy irresistible to men, women and music critics.''I didn't want him to be just a kind of seducer,'' Mr. Malet says. ''I wanted him to be passing through a state of grace. I am older now, but I remember when I was 20, 22, feeling that everything was possible, everything became gold. In this film, the boy is very dangerous, smashing up everything, but it's not conscious, it's just a natural way of behaving.''Also, it was important to me that the public believe me when I play the violin. When I saw 'New York, New York,' I believed Robert De Niro was playing sax. I asked the producers if I could take violin lessons, and they said, 'We don't have any money for that,' so I worked on my own with a young violinist in Paris, and he taught me. Not to play Paganini in two months - that was not possible - but how to use a violin as part of myself.''Fabio Carpi, the writer-director of ''Basileus Quartet,'' is, according to Mr. Malet, ''completely obsessed with the problem of getting old.'' ''He used to be a writer,'' Mr. Malet says. ''He's famous in Italy, he's won a lot of prizes. He's 65, and this is his third film, and both his others are on the same subject. The first one was about a deaf boy and an old man. And when I left for America last week, he told me: 'I wrote a new script. There is a part for you. It's the story of an old man and a young man.' It's something he's thinking about all the time. ''He is very austere, never smiles. He is always upset about the door which closes, when you pass a certain age. He's got a son, and he has the same problem with his son that my character had with the three men in the film. Sometimes I would have disagreements with him. I think many young people take responsibility for their acts, but he doesn't think so.''Mr. Malet is pleased to have played the part in ''Basileus Quartet'' because he is convinced that there are few interesting roles for a young actor in France. Especially a handsome young actor. ''If you're looking a little better than the others,'' he says, ''they think you're stupid. They would never give me a part like the one in 'Taxi Driver.' They give me stupid parts, romantic parts, the hero with a big H. I don't like it.''The Loser in 'Reckless,' Shades of James DeanSex symbols come in many different packages. Edo Morel, the young man in ''Basileus Quartet'' is beloved of the gods, a golden-fingered winner. Johnny Rourke, the young man in ''Reckless'' (opening today at five New York theaters), is your basic loser. He's got a drunk for a father, the preppies with whom he shares his high school classrooms sneer at him, and he spends a good deal of time on his motorcycle, looking lonely and running over beer cans. Still, there is industry speculation that Aidan Quinn who plays Johnny may be the next James Dean. At 24, wasn't it hard to pretend to be a high school kid? No, says Mr. Quinn. ''I did this film over a year ago, and I was 23. But there was something about the rebellion in the boy that reminded me of myself when I was younger, and made me want to do it.'' The Chicago-born, Mr. Quinn followed his parents back to Ireland the year he got out of high school, but he couldn't figure out a way to survive in Dublin. ''I loved living in Ireland,'' he says. ''The theater was terrific. But it's hard to find work there. I came back to Chicago and did everything to make a living. I worked as a janitor, I painted houses, I was a cocktail waiter. You get depressed sometimes, but I felt something good was going to happen to me. I mean, I've been acting all my life. You know, imitating people. When I was working as a roofer with a bunch of big tough guys from the South Side of Chicago, and we were sitting around drinking whisky the first thing in the morning, I was putting on a big act, like, 'Don't mess with me.' ''In four years of trying to find theater jobs in Chicago, Mr. Quinn managed to work in just four plays. ''I was dying to work more,'' he says. ''But I didn't think about movies. Movies are unreal. You sit in this hotel room, and it has a computerized door, and you watch yourself on television giving interviews, and you think, 'What did I do?' I want to get back to a play soon. I want to work with a group. Because when you're sitting alone in a hotel room, you might start believing the hype.''A casting director wending her way through Chicago had taken a Polaroid picture of Mr. Quinn, and that was how he came to be submitted to James Foley, director of ''Reckless,'' who hadn't been able to find the actor he needed to play the lead in the picture. At first, having got the picture, Mr. Quinn was scared. ''I didn't sleep for three weeks,'' he says. ''I was a mess. I didn't think I was doing very good. But I always think like that. Then the other thing comes into it. You tell yourself, it's just like dealing with that bunch of tough roofers, you got to adapt. It was Jamie Foley's first picture, too. I think we did the best we could, but I can't watch myself.''Some actors start a film career, and their talent is fully developed. Mine isn't. I have a long way to go before I consider myself a good actor. Sometimes, before I consider myself a competent actor.''Martin Scorsese disagrees. The director saw ''Reckless'' at some stage and hired Mr. Quinn to play Jesus in his ''Last Temptation of Christ.'' ''Marty quite liked 'Reckless,' '' says Mr. Quinn. ''I mean, he said, 'I hate this kind of movie,' but he thought Jamie Foley did a real good job for a first try. After I got the part of Jesus, I worked with Marty for three months. I read with other actors every day, while he was casting. It's so strange to be on the other side. You feel so much for the actors coming in, the nerves, the fear. You want to tell them, 'You do wonderful work.'''Then the production was canceled. I'm just recovering from that. But I know we'll end up doing it.

'Reckless Moment' New Feature at the Palace -- British and Two French Films Also Arrive - The New York Times,"her ""reckless moment""—for not only is the body found by the police, but a blackmailer who suspects the lady shows up with some rather harsh demands. Seems that he wants $5,000. So the poor lady not only has to run her family and get ready for Christmas, but she has to figure how she can raise that amount of coin. With Joan Bennett playing the lady in this Walter Wanger film, the nuisance of the dilemma is eminently disclosed. Miss Bennett prettily chews pencils, trying to find a way to cut the household bills, and innocently takes a few baubles to a loan office in hopes of getting a loan. Meanwhile her unsuspecting children, David Bair and Geraldine Brooks, indulge their own selfish interests, little recking her anxiety. However, by rare good fortune the blackmailer happens to be a wistful and charming Irishman, whom James Mason gallantly plays. And he, deeply touched by the lady, her beauty and her plight, falls in love, makes a sacrificial gesture and takes the blame for the supposed murder ere he dies. Thus Miss Bennett is able to phone her husband on Christmas Eve and tell him not to worry, that everything is all right at home. Maybe it is with that lady. Maybe she doesn't mind having done a completely stupid and plainly unprincipled thing just to protect her daughter (and herself) from a little distress. But it isn't all right with this picture. Although it is rather well staged, with credible location settings in Balboa and Los Angeles, it is a feeble and listless drama with a shamelessly callous attitude. The heroine gets away with folly, but we don't think this picture will. THE RECKLESS MOMENT, screen play by Henry Garson and Robert W. Soderberg, from a Mel Dinelli and Robert E.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Even more transitory than its title implies, ""It Can't Last Forever,"" which the Rialto brought in yesterday, weaves a tenuous thread of comedy and melodrama about a modern Frankenstein and his radioactive monster. The ogre (in the completely unogrish person of Ralph Bellamy) is the radio personality ""modestly called ""The Master Mind."" Compounded of publicity, a soothing voice and public credulity, ""The Master Mind"" functions smoothly, despite the occasional snooping of a newspaper skeptic, until racketeers muscle in on his program, try to compel him to steer dupes into their stock-swindle schemes. That's the sum of the picture, and a fairly small entertainment total it makes. The narrative follows the most obvious and main-traveled course, with not entirely successful pauses while Raymond Walburn plays drunk or Betty Furness sweeps through her city room. With a bit of ingenuity, the writers might have developed into gay comedy the rueful plight of a master mind who tried to guess wrong and couldn't. But there wasn't, they didn't and ""It Can't Last Forever"" won't, which is probably just as well. Mr. Bellamy still impresses me as being better than the material he habitually gets.

Even a bush-league prophet can tell you that the collaboration of Jean Harlow and William Powell is an inspiration of happy casting. It would be pleasant to report that ""Reckless"" is the whirlwind comedy which such a merger would lead us to expect. But reporters are chained to facts, and this morning's bulletin from the Capitol is mournful. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has taken the screen's liveliest comedienne and chased her through a stale and profitless meringue of backstage routines and high society amour. Perhaps you will understand the gravity of the situation when you are informed that Miss Harlow becomes a mother, that her millionaire husband, Franchot Tone, kills himself; that Mr. Powell wallows dismally in a secret passion for the lady and that his sacrificial orgies in her behalf cause May Robson to remark: ""I think God's bookkeeper wrote off all your sins today.""The photoplay enrolls Miss Harlow as a musical comedy star and, in its passion for spectacle, finds it necessary to pretend that she is doing her own singing and dancing when it is reasonably obvious that doubles are performing for her. Transforming an excellent comedienne into an unconvincing song-and-dance artist does not impress these untutored eyes as a miracle of horse sense. In a surface style of fake sophistication and strained humor, the work rewrites a lurid society scandal which was hot in the news several years ago. As the climax of a particularly wet evening Miss Harlow marries a drunken playboy and wakes up to find that his family and the swanky set are bitterly resentful of her. While her husband continues to drink himself to death she is making a serious effort to play the good wife. After a lurid evening of recrimination and jealousy she seeks refuge with her old friend Mr. Powell. When the husband shoots himself in their presence, public opinion decides that the showgirl killed him. With Mr. Powell's loyal assistance she fights her way back into the public affections. Mr. Powell survives the ordeal more successfully than his partner. As the playboy husband, Franchot Tone consumes prodigious quantities of liquor and plays the cad in his usual impeccable style. The excellence of the cast continues into the lower brackets, where you will find such pleasant people as May Robson, Henry Stephenson, Ted Healy and Nat Pendleton. But the photoplay is basically mediocre, and Metro's skillful technical production is seldom able to conceal the picture's defects. . . .

The Goose Hangs High.' - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from January 9, 1932, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Lewis Beach's play, ""The Goose Hangs High,"" which James Cruze turned into a silent film some seven years ago, is at present to be seen at the Paramount as a talking picture. It is now known as ""The Reckless Age,"" and this is not the only change it has undergone, for the incidents of the story have been altered, and while the theme is adhered to, the plot is not nearly as plausible as it was in the parent work. Thanks, however, to some good acting, especially by Richard Bennett, Charles Ruggles, Frances Starr and Maude Eburne, this offering is for the most part quite entertaining. It is a case of a thoughtless son and daughter, who give little or no heed to the sacrifices made by their parents, turning up trumps at the crucial time. When they are wild, they are very, very wild, and when they undertake to save their father from disgrace they go at it whole-heartedly. Instead of Donald Ingals, the father, being a political employe, as in the play, he is here a mining expert, who is so eager to welcome his children home for Christmas that he permits an agent to fill in from his own notebook the report on mining properties. This is itself somewhat incredible, owing to the possible chances of mistakes and the effect it would have on his reputation, but he commits also the fatal blunder of signing his name to a sheet of blank paper to be filled in by a man who, while he has befriended Ingals, is obviously out for his own gain. The tale is then concerned with the happy-go-lucky daughter Lois, who would be a source of worry to any mother, and the colorless son, Donald, who, still having a year and a half to go before he is graduated from college, thinks only of when he can marry the fair creature he has brought back home with him. Toward the close there comes the stunning blow about the false report on the mining property and the discovery that Ingals's ""friend"" is a wolf in sheep's clothing. To save Ingals, who needs $10,000, Donald proves to be very clever and Lois hustles after her godfather, one Goliath Whitney, to let him know that she will become his wife. Mary Burke, Donald's sweetheart, also contributes to the fact that the goose hangs high in the Ingals home before the final fade-out. Charles (Buddy) Rogers is good-looking as Bradley, but there is not much, to tax his acting talent in this rôle. Frances Dee does exceedingly well as Lois, and Peggy Shannon is believable as Mary Burke. And then there are Mr. Bennett and Mr. Ruggles and the other players already mentioned. Ruth St. Denis is to be seen on the stage in the course of a revue called ""Variations."" The other stellar performer is Bing Crosby.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Further exploits of gangsters are beheld in ""Born Reckless,"" a free audible pictorial translation of Donald Henderson Clarke's book, ""Louis Beretti,"" which is now holding forth at the Roxy. John Ford, who won the last Photoplay Magazine gold medal award with his ""Four Sons,"" is responsible for the able direction of this current offering, which is blessed with clever acting, keen humor and a minimum of stereotyped stuff. Although it is very different from the original work, Mr. Clarke can at least feel that his story inspired the producers to make a thoroughly entertaining film. Edmund Lowe impersonates the redoubtable Beretti so capably that his few good deeds outshine his nefarious activities. This Beretti treats chances for a ""rap"" philosophically and even slightly. He is, however, more than slightly relieved when, the District Attorney gives him and two others a chance to redeem themselves by going to fight in France instead of being incarcerated. Prior to crossing the ocean Louis and the others have their clashes with sergeants and officers. When he is asked for ""his line"" Beretti ventures that he is a jeweler. Another man says that he is a ball player. A third hazards that his daily toil is that of an ice man. A rich young man says that he does not do anything but go to college, and a none-too-good-looking individual volunteers that he is a burglar, which is understood as a ""bugler.""Beretti, not recognizing a General, in one scene asks the high officer for a light and addresses him as ""Doc."" Later in France, when he is flirting with a pretty French girl, he says ""Sherman was wrong."" The attractive wench says ""Cheri,"" and Beretti, evidently believing that she meant ""share it"" (some sugar), offers to do so immediately. He is a hero on the battlefield and a bad man at home. He looks upon ""old John Law"" as pretty hard to beat. One of the many laughable incidents in this film is where Charles Banks, who has proposed to Beretti's sister, is introduced to Louis's gang. They do not hesitate to make comments on the young man, and one of them calls him ""Four Eyes."" The harmless fellow with spectacles resents this, and as he passes through the door with Beretti he is heard saying that he dislikes being referred to as ""Four Eyes."" Little does he know of the type of men he has just encountered. Like in George Bancroft's last picture, ""Ladies Love Brutes,"" there is a kidnapping, but in this case it is more plausible than in the Bancroft film. Beretti hears from Joan, the sister of Frank Sheldon, his wealthy buddy who met death on the battlefield, that her child has been kidnapped. He suspects his gangster pal. Big Shot, of the crime, and after recovering the youngster, he takes the law in his own hands. Although this film is not weighty material, it makes a good entertainment. Catherine Dale Owen may not be a Duse when it comes to acting, but she is very attractive. Others who help out in this film are Lee Tracy, William Harrigan, Paul Page, Frank Albertson and Warren Hymer. There are several excellent stage numbers, including Beatrice Belkin in the aria from ""The Star of the North,"" the Roxyettes in ""Putting on the Dog"" and ""A Russian Wedding.""""Louis Beretti.""BORN RECKLESS, with Edmund Lowe, Catherine Dale Owen, Lee Tracy, Marguerite Churchill, Warren Hymer, William Harrigan, Frank Albertson, Eddie Gribbon, Paul Page, Ben Bard, Mike Donlin, Paul Porcasi, Joe Brown, Roy Stewart, Ferike Boros and Pat Somerset, based on Donald Henderson Clarke's novel, ""Louis Beretti,"" directed by John Ford; overture, ""Die Schoene Galatea""; ""Valse Bluette,"" with Patricia Bowman and others; aria from ""The Star of the North""; ""Putting on the Dog,"" with the Roxyettes; ""A Russian Wedding."" At the Roxy Theatre. William Powell, the Philo Vance of three films of S. S. Van Dine murder mysteries, finds himself on the other side of the fence in ""Shadow of the Law,"" an interesting but albeit somewhat implausible talking pictorial melodrama. It was adapted by Max Marcin from John A. Moroso's novel, ""The Quarry."" The introductory scenes are a little abrupt, but the others are expertly filmed. The woman in this case is a peculiar specimen of humanity, for in the beginning she runs away because she fears notoriety, but subsequently she resorts to blackmail. At least five years pass by in this picture without either James Montgomery (Mr. Powell) or Ethel Barry (Natalie Moorehead) looking any older than when the story starts. Montgomery, for a scene or two, does show the results or his years in prison, but after his escape and congenial existence under another name the lines of care vanish and he is as he was in the opening scenes. Montgomery encounters the ashblonde, Ethel Barry, and is about to enter her room when she discovers that a paramour is already there. This individual is intoxicated and there follows a fight in which Montgomery strikes the other man and causes him to fall out of a window. The man is killed. He is a wealthy broker and Ethel flees, leaving Montgomery to face the music. Montgomery is tried for manslaughter, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The police in the meantime have not been able to find Ethel. Montgomery shares a cell in prison with Pete, who betrays a sense of humor when he refers to the dangers of life in the open. He tells Montgomery that when one gets into prison there's only one thing to think about, and that is getting out. The prison warden, sensing Montgomery's intelligence, tries to prevail upon him to be a stool-pigeon, but the convict at once lets Pete know what the warden wanted him to do. Pete eventually aids Montgomery to escape, and the latter is carted away in a packing case in which there is a suit of dark clothes. Two years later Montgomery, as John Nelson, is running Colonel Wentworth's large mill in North Carolina. Edith Wentworth, the Colonel's daughter, falls in love with Nelson, who, as time goes on, would like to clear himself of the crime of which he was convicted. Pete, having been released from prison, goes to see Montgomery, and the latter gives his jail mate $5,000 to pay Ethel Barry to tell the true details of the death of her paramour. For some reason or other Ethel, when found, senses a chance to make Montgomery pay ten times that amount, and, to complicate matters, she causes Pete to be arrested. As he is a jail-bird, the fact that he has $5,000 in his possession is naturally looked upon with suspicion by the police. The story harps upon blackmail and then reverts to the idea that virtually all the police have as proof that Nelson is Montgomery are his fingerprints. A hint of what Montgomery intends doing about the fingerprints is given during a factory scene, and soon he succeeds in carrying out his scheme to destroy his finger tips in the factory machinery. Miss Wentworth sees to it that there is a happy ending to this yarn. Mr. Powell's acting is capital. So is that of Paul Hurst, who plays Pete. Natalie Moorehead does well as the strange Ethel Barry.

"Review: In ‘Killing Them Safely,’ a Debate on the Virtues of Tasers - The New York Times","The rise, use and abuse of the Taser form the discomfiting subject of Nick Berardini’s “Killing Them Safely,” but an equally formidable weapon also goes on display: words. In the 1990s, the brothers Rick and Tom Smith amped up a decades-old invention to create their electricity-zapping “home run product.” Since then, their company, Taser International, has defended the Taser’s virtues with on-message verbiage in the face of deaths associated with the weapon. Mr. Berardini primes us to dislike the device by showing a Taser being tested on buffaloes, but the footage of the massive animals crumpling effectively illustrates a macho fantasy of violent control fulfilled by the weapon. The heavily researched documentary features surveillance and dashboard video of people killed by Tasers, and demonstrates the results of the device’s widespread adoption by the police, often without sufficient training. Taser International also has its say through an empty-eyed publicity representative and the Smiths, who argue that the weapon saves lives as an alternative to a gun. Between the contentious talk about Tasers and the queasy video footage of zaps and falls, the movie becomes a dense stew of words and death. The company’s boosterism of the benefits of “neuromuscular incapacitation” for law enforcement and its highly constrained sense of responsibility together suggest something out of “RoboCop.” (Company motto: “Protecting Life. Protecting Truth.”)Mr. Berardini’s packed documentary makes its case early and often, perhaps too often, but it’s more chilling than your average issue film. In the hands of a determined business, a violent invention can be a game-changer that gives rise to tragic losses.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/movies/review-in-killing-them-safely-a-debate-on-the-virtues-of-tasers.html
‘Safe Haven’ Stars Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel - The New York Times,"The romantic thriller “Safe Haven” plays like an extended infomercial for the lulling charms of Southport, N. C., where the movie was filmed. This picture-perfect town is presented as the go-to destination for terrorized damsels in distress. Here in this tiny paradise, where gentle waters lap the shore and gold-and-purple sunsets stretch all the way to heaven, a new beginning awaits. A selling point in this glossy real-estate spread is the opportunity to snag a local dreamboat who is even yummier than the buff ciphers distributing roses on “The Bachelor.” If “Safe Haven” is a hit, poor little Southport could face a stampede of ravenous bachelorettes. Watching this weepy sudsfest, the eighth film adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel, is like drawing a scented bath. The first spritz from the faucet may be scalding, but once you adjust the temperature, you can settle into a warm and caressing soup and dream the impossible dream. But before that dream can come true, you must endure one final test: a nightmarish Fourth of July of fire and fury in which the past screeches into town determined to drag you back into the bowels of hell. That hell is Boston. The distressed damsel, Katie Feldman (Julianne Hough), is shown in the opening scene fleeing her Boston home in the rain with a policeman in hot pursuit. Extremely coy about the circumstances of her departure, the movie suggests she may have killed someone, but you don’t see enough of the body to determine either the victim’s identity or state of being. Katie boards an Atlanta-bound bus and impulsively gets off at Southport, where she rents a cabin in the woods and takes a job waiting on tables in a cafe. Here she meets Prince Charming, a k a Alex Wheatley (Josh Duhamel), a widowed storekeeper raising two adorable children, Josh (Noah Lomax) and Lexi (Mimi Kirkland). Katie is also befriended by Jo (Cobie Smulders), a mysterious, slightly creepy neighbor she first meets when she arrives home to find the woman peering through the windows of her shabby fixer-upper. “Safe Haven,” directed by Lasse Hallstrom from a screenplay by Dana Stevens and Gage Lansky, spices this idyll with enough small shocks to sustain an underlying tone of dread. As Katie relaxes and opens up, you worry that her new life seems too good to be true. To maintain the suspense the movie occasionally flashes back to the scene of the crime being investigated by Kevin Tierney (David Lyons), a handsome wild-eyed Javert. It isn’t long before Katie’s face adorns a person-of-interest poster in a first-degree murder case. A question gnaws: Who are these people? As in a reality show dating competition, most subjects of conversation are off limits. With no mention of politics, religion, money or cultural tastes, the characters are attractive blanks who invite you fill in the emptiness with your fantasies. The lovers, whose romance develops very slowly, frolic on the beach with Alex’s children and go canoeing. But that’s about it. Alex’s wife died of cancer several years earlier, and there is the obligatory I-miss-Mommy moment that efficiently taps into the movie’s well of crocodile tears. The weakest parts of “Safe Haven” are its action sequences, in which the illusion of reality is shattered by ham-handed editing, garish special effects and comic-book dialogue. The climactic inferno, which explodes whatever credibility the movie built up, is immediately followed by a cheap, out-of-the-blue supernatural twist. The equivalent of a forged signature, it attests to the movie’s essential falsity. “Safe Haven” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has scenes of violence and some strong language.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/movies/safe-haven-stars-julianne-hough-and-josh-duhamel.html

Mei, it turns out, is a math prodigy who knows a code coveted by the Chinese Triads, the Russians and corrupt cops. Luke, it turns out, has a history in law enforcement. Bring on the redemption, overabundant shootouts and whiplash editing. Regrettably, there’s less fancy footwork than usual for Mr. Statham (though a crunchy hand-to-hand subway brawl has its delights). And few opportunities to display actorly nuance (especially with his young co-star). Still, a long close-up of Luke grieving for his wife suggests remarkable depths. Quentin Tarantino’s producer Lawrence Bender believes in Mr. Statham; he is a producer of “Safe.” So does Kevin Spacey, an executive producer here. Now, if only someone would offer this actor a project worthy of the full range of his talent. “Safe” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Profuse gunplay. Insufficient fisticuffs and character-defining moments.",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/movies/safe-starring-jason-statham.html
"‘Safe House,’ With Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds - The New York Times","the name smacks of airport spy fiction — isn’t really the enigma the filmmakers would like you to believe, but Mr. Washington is so good at suggesting deep reserves of cool, moody mystery and smoldering feeling that he keeps you nicely guessing. Did or didn’t Frost betray his country is the question that the credited screenwriter David Guggenheim and Daniel Espinosa, the young, up-and-coming Swedish director, put into nimble play almost as soon as “Safe House” gets going. And, after some low-key place setting in Cape Town, where Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), an untested C. I. A. agent, is watching over a company safe house, the movie takes off like a shot. Frost, having just snaked his way through the city, dodging a gun-toting, shooting horde, and setting citizens scrambling every which way, has slipped into the American Embassy and, after announcing his identity, been swept away by agents to the safe house for debriefing. Like a lot of contemporary action directors Mr. Espinosa tends to cut among several scenes, switching not simply between two scenes but also upward of four. In lesser hands this kind of editing scheme can devolve into visual and narrative chaos, as the filmmaker whiplashes from one location to another, sometimes for no apparent reason. Working with the editor Richard Pearson, whose credits include “The Bourne Supremacy,” Mr. Espinosa maintains a visually coherent, narratively rational sense of time and space no matter how fast the story shifts about, which it does with increasing speed when that same heavily armed horde that had been chasing Frost breaches the safe house, slaughtering most of the American operatives and sending Frost and Weston running. Although the writers try to pump up the story and give it some “Bourne”-like layering, the story ebbs into more familiar cynicism rather than building toward political complexity. “Safe House” is essentially and very effectively a rollicking smash-and-crash chase movie that happens to be surprisingly well acted. Mr. Washington, it almost goes without saying, is its anchor; when he’s on screen everything seems to matter more, so much so that a prequel seems inevitable. How Frost became the man that he did is one of the mysteries, as is how well Weston and the actor playing him will rise to the occasion. Mr. Reynolds, whose curiously unsettled career is its own puzzle, rises here to meet Mr. Washington’s challenge, investing Weston with a slow-building, believable vulnerability. Mr. Espinosa will rightly receive a lot of attention for his action scenes, which oscillate between heavily populated sequences and small-scale fights in tight, tight spaces, though it’s his work with the actors and his attention to beauty that puts “Safe House” a cut above the genre rest. The supporting cast, which includes Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, Rubén Blades and Robert Patrick, does its part too, as does the cinematographer Oliver Wood, who, it’s worth noting, also shot all three “Bourne” movies. The world, the filmmakers say again and again, is a terrible place, and yet, as you look at this film, with its beautifully bleached-out palette and somewhat coarse visual texture — the images look as if they had been lightly sandpapered — it’s hard not to be struck by its loveliness. “Safe House” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Action-cinema violence.",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/10/movies/safe-house-with-denzel-washington-and-ryan-reynolds.html
FILM REVIEW; Interrelated Shards Of Suburban Pathology - The New York Times,"The four families who populate ''The Safety of Objects,'' a new film by Rose Troche, live in pleasant houses bunched together on a clean and breezy patch of suburban land. Their lives are a somber and lurid tapestry of dysfunction whose dominant hues are guilt, frustration and sexual perversity, which are, after all, what people move to the suburbs for in the first place. Not really, of course. But the idea that the split-levels and cul-de-sacs of American suburbia are breeding grounds of pathology has become, in the decades since World War II, a touchstone of American fiction and cinema, a convention that flourishes independent of whatever is really going on behind the shrubbery and the vinyl siding. Happily, ''The Safety of Objects,'' adapted by Ms. Troche from a book of stories by A. M. Homes, declines to offer smug, warmed-over sociological insights in the manner of Sam Mendes's florid and overrated ''American Beauty.''The miseries that the inhabitants of this unnamed community find themselves immersed in, and inflict upon each other, are less a matter of social milieu than of metaphysics. Ms. Homes's despondent spouses and kinky children are case studies in fallen humanity, and Ms. Troche, weaving them together, emphasizes the stringent fatalism that animates the writer's harsh, deadpan prose. The movie is unsettling because it refuses to view its characters from a reassuring, judgmental distance. What they do is often inexplicable, grotesque or absurd, and they are, more often than not, estranged from their own feelings, but sympathy for them sprouts around the edges of their world like a persistent weed. Ms. Homes's book is a collection of jagged shards, which Ms. Troche has ingeniously bound together into a coherent whole. Her movie owes an obvious debt to ''Short Cuts,'' in which Robert Altman fused the bleak particularity of Raymond Carver's stories into a panoramic tableau of marital and generational disconnection. Ms. Troche's canvas is smaller, and her movie sometimes feels a little too crowded and burdened with incident. When you stop to think about it, these divorces, kidnappings, infidelities and sundry mental disorders, all occurring within a few feet of one another, heard over hedges and glimpsed through windows, should add up to a dour, overwrought soap opera. But Ms. Troche paces the movie with enough artfulness to keep such objections at bay, and the cast treads lightly even through the swampiest emotional terrain. Glenn Close, with wounded, chilly grace, plays Esther Gold, a middle-aged woman whose life has come to revolve around her son, Paul (Joshua Jackson), who lies comatose in his bedroom after a car accident. Paralyzed with grief but also, perhaps for the first time, enjoying a perfect rapport with her favorite child, Esther neglects her daughter, Julie (Jessica Campbell), who drifts through her days in torpid erotic reverie. The impact of Paul's accident, which is reconstructed in a series of teasing flashbacks, was not limited to his own family, and it gradually becomes clear that the young man, an aspiring rock musician, is the link between the film's disparate narrative strands. Each family, though, is unhappy in its own creepy way. Jim Train (Dermot Mulroney) is an ambitious lawyer who cracks up after he is passed over for a partnership. In search of a new purpose, he gravitates toward Esther, who has entered an endurance contest to win an S. U. V. for Julie. Meanwhile, Jim's young son (Alex House) pursues a passionate affair with one of his sister's dolls, and one of his playmates, a tomboy named Sam (Kristen Stewart), is abducted by a disturbed young landscaper (Timothy Olyphant). Sam's mother, who had been Paul's lover, struggles to hold on to her dignity and her children after the breakup of her family. There is more, but to enumerate all the subplots might create the misleading impression of a misshapen, melodramatic movie and might also break the unnerving spell that Ms. Troche casts. Her touch is not always sure: the delicacy of certain scenes is spoiled by intrusive music, and the strain of editing together so many different narratives is sometimes apparent. But with the help of an ensemble that is nearly flawless, she assembles the damaged human elements of Ms. Homes's world with patience and precision, and more often than not chooses dry understatement over easy satire or obvious sentiment.''The Safety of Objects'' opens today in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego and Portland, Ore. It is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has many sexual situations, both overt and implicit, which take place in a general climate of emotional violence.

FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; Delicate Moral Questions Under the Nazis in France - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from October 8, 2002, Section E, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Bertrand Tavernier is not often thought of as a man of passion. Even ''Round Midnight,'' his 1986 film on an alienated bop musician, seemed remote and grim textured. His enthusiasms are evident from the subjects he chooses rather than their substance; with the exception of the artful and laconic ''A Sunday in the Country,'' they serve mainly as a backdrop. But in ''Safe Conduct,'' this French filmmaker's newest work, which will be shown today and Thursday at the New York Film Festival, the heat of the moment prevails. It cooks ''Conduct'' in a low, smoky and inviting sizzle. Heavy with incident and running nearly three hours, ''Conduct'' follows the attempts of the French film industry to stay alive during the Nazi occupation. The characters are constantly asking questions about the nature of art: whether it deserves to continue through such a time and how fine is the line between ambition and opportunism? But Mr. Tavernier stages the movie like a dance marathon, intelligently shifting the pace and scale of the drama. The movie is full of juices that give it a healthy, pungent flow.''Safe Conduct'' is likable because the people here aren't archetypes. As they pose weighty questions of moral choice to themselves, they have to keep working and eating, too. There's a compelling desperation, something Mr. Tavernier has brought to the screen with only intermittent success before. Working with material based on actual events and with characters who really existed and had to balance the horror of living under the shadow of the Nazis with conducting their own lives has given the director a new lease on life. Mr. Tavernier keeps the story hopping by segueing smoothly between the lives of two men, an assistant director, Jean Devaivre (Jacques Gamblin), and a screenwriter, Jean Aurenche (Denis Podalydès). Both men work for Continental Films, a movie company financed by the Germans. (The Nazis had offices at the studio and regularly looted resources for their own needs.)The director treats them as two wholly different types, with wildly varying temperaments. Aurenche is a bubbly improviser who bounces from clinch to clinch, looking for women he can seduce and ears into which he can whisper his entreaties for work. At the start of ''Conduct'' (which opens Friday in Manhattan), he's trying to complete a conquest -- and Mr. Tavernier gives this scene the busy chirpiness of a screwball comedy sequence until Aurenche's companion gazes out the window as Paris is being bombed. Mr. Tavernier makes so many varied beats play in this scene that you feel he's never been this engaged as a filmmaker. Devaivre's is the more conventional story. He's really the hero: a family man devoted to his friends and a thoughtful crew member who's obviously a director in the making. He sharply and modestly solves problems for the film director, Maurice Tourneur (Philppe Morier-Genoud), a soft-voiced, heavy-shouldered papa bear of a man who is one of the many real-life figures that populate the film. Devaivre is also a member of the Resistance and labors to keep all the various aspects of his life in working order. The strain is evident; he looks exhausted when we meet him and there's much more to come. Mr. Gamblin plays him as a man whose essential decency is a compulsion; he has to do what's right. If that requires his jumping on his bicycle to ride hundreds of miles to see his wife and child, who are hidden in the countryside, or taking that same bicycle to help get plans of an invasion to the Allies, he'll take the honorable course without a second thought. Mr. Gamblin brings a piquant complexity to the role; he's not just duty-bound but a man whose honest amiability is branded with empathy. He can see himself in others, unlike the raffish predator Aurenche, who sees what he can get out of others. (That makes this Aurenche, who in real life later worked with Tavernier, comic relief.) This side of Mr. Gamblin plays especially well when Devaivre finds himself trying to communicate with the R. A. F. in London after a journey calling for a train, a plane and, of course, his bike. The sheer nuttiness of the day is alleviated by a quotidian absurdity; Devaivre, shivering with fever and choking down mugs of English tea, has to get back to Paris in time for work. Mr. Tavernier leans into powerful, contradictory chords in ''Safe Conduct,'' alluding to the irony of French filmmakers getting the chance to make more emotionally mature films under the Germans than during French rule. Devaivre defends Henri-Georges Clouzot's free-swinging ''Le Corbeau.'' (As long as the pictures didn't criticize the Nazis, the Germans didn't care.)For all its virtues, the movie finally slumps under its Brobdingnagian length. The picture has the reach of an epic, accomplishing a great deal on what was surely a limited budget, but inevitably it has the sprawl of an epic, too. Still, for a sizable portion of its running time, the movie allows the director to show us a range of life and feeling that grew out of his love of film, the elemental force that keeps the world of ''Conduct'' spinning. SAFE CONDUCTDirected by Bertrand Tavernier; written (in French, with English subtitles) by Jean Cosmos and Mr. Tavernier; director of photography, Alain Choquart; edited by Sophie Brunet; music by Antoine Duhamel; production designer, Émile Ghigo; produced by Alain Sarde and Frédéric Bourboulon; released by Empire Pictures.

FILM REVIEW; Can't Sing? No Problem. How About Safecracking? - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from August 7, 1998, Section E, Page 21Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. There's a difference between foolish and funny. People in silly situations aren't necessarily wellsprings of laughter. By mistaking foolish for funny and silly for hilarious, the new movie ''Safe Men'' comes a cropper. In the end, it stands revealed as a low-energy comedy with sufficient signs of willingness to stray off the beaten track to indicate that somewhere down the line its writer and director, John Hamburg, will create something far better.''Safe Men'' tells the story of Sam and Eddie (Sam Rockwell and Steve Zahn), two losers in Providence, R. I. For five years, they have been trying without success to establish themselves as singers, but Sam can't remember the lyrics and they cannot even manage to entertain the members of the Pulaski Association. En route home from their latest failure, they are mistaken in a bar for Frank and Mitchell (Mark Ruffalo and Josh Pais), a couple of flawless local safecrackers who seem to have studied small talk and fast food with Quentin Tarantino. Soon Sam and Eddie are conned into picking up an easy $300,000 from an ailing old man's safe, but the job is really only a ruse to put them in thrall to Big Fat Bernie Gayle (Michael Lerner), the fatherly and ferocious local mob boss. To save their lives, the inept Sam and Eddie are ordered to pull off a few jobs, while Bernie prepares his hockey-loving son, Bernie Jr. (Michael Schmidt), for his lavish bar mitzvah. One of the safecracking assignments introduces Sam to Hannah (Christina Kirk), who is not only the daughter of Providence's other big crook, Good Stuff Leo, a fence played by Harvey Fierstein, but also the ex-girlfriend of Frank, who is eager to return to her good graces. Though its sight gags include an ice sculpture of the Stanley Cup and a yarmulke embroidered with the emblem of the New York Rangers, ''Safe Men'' is far longer on dull talk than inventively comic action. And the hangdog Sam and Eddie, central to the plot, lack the wattage to light up the proceedings.''Safe Men'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some impolite language, threats and comic violence.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Living in a bubble of antiseptic privilege, Carol (Julianne Moore) is a stranger in a strange land. Her life is a string of hollow rituals and reflexive thoughts. Her big, clean house is eerily forbidding. Her uninteresting husband, Greg (Xander Berkeley), is barely there. Carol is much less excited by him than by delivery men who bring her a new sofa in a color she didn't order. Seen through the small end of Todd Haynes's telescope in his elegantly unnerving ""Safe,"" Carol begins showing symptoms of a peculiar malaise. And throughout this film's beautifully directed first hour, ominous signs of it are everywhere. Protected inside her garage, Carol sneezes. In aerobics class she jumps impassively and doesn't sweat. A hair permanent somehow makes her nose bleed. One day, she sits while servants and workmen quietly navigate around her, not even knowing what language to speak in her own home. (""Can I have some milk? Some leche?"" she uneasily asks the maid.) There's no corner of this world in which Carol belongs. The safest thing about ""Safe,"" opening today at the Angelika Film Center, is surely a target like Carol, who's more a specimen than a heroine as she makes her wan, enervated way through Mr. Haynes's story. Yet for a while he succeeds in making her the most hauntingly cryptic bourgeoise this side of ""Belle de Jour,"" failing only when it comes time to give his audience some glimpse of her inner life. Brilliantly as it begins, ""Safe"" eventually succumbs to its own modern malady, as the film maker insists on a chilly ambiguity that breeds more detachment than interest. The misanthropy of Mr. Haynes's aggressively clever ""Poison"" is more muted here, but it still has a numbing effect. Devoting the first half of ""Safe"" to capturing a dead world under glass, Mr. Haynes displays a hauntingly effective visual style. Long shots, flat compositions and cruel fluorescent lighting create a powerfully disorienting effect, as does the neurasthenic edge Ms. Moore subtly brings to Carol's role. Her performance remains intelligent and alive even when the character begins dying on the vine. Frightfully polite at first, Carol begins losing composure in gradual stages, until she begins having panic attacks that shred the decorousness of her San Fernando Valley life. One of the film's spookiest sequences finds Carol at a baby shower, dutifully saying all the right things until she just can't take it anymore. Having commented on the cake (""This is delicious"") and the hostess's child (""She's getting so big""), Carol suddenly finds herself gasping for breath and falling apart.""Do you smell fumes? Are you allergic to the 20th century?"" Carol sees that sign on a bulletin board and it strikes a nerve. She begins exploring environmental illness, thinking she is being poisoned by stray chemicals that are insinuatingly evident. And she finds herself drawn to a New Age community led by ""a chemically sensitive person with AIDS"" and given over to rituals as arcane as those of squeaky-clean suburbia. Or are they? Mr. Haynes makes fools of these New Agers while possibly embracing some of their views. The film's emblematic figure is seen in the distance at Wrenwood, the retreat near Albuquerque, N. M., where Carol arrives lugging her suitcases and an oxygen tank. Safety at Wrenwood may mean the security of a porcelain-lined igloo or the supposed comfort of consciousness-raising sessions. (""Now, Speaker No. 2, describe to your friend a room that you remember having as a child,"" says the instructor at one session.) Meanwhile, across the desert, Carol glimpses a wraithlike person fully covered by protective gear and moving as if in pain. ""He's just very, very afraid,"" someone explains. ""Afraid to eat. Afraid to breathe.""How does life at Wrenwood compare with the life Carol has left behind? Is there spiritual or medical hope for her? Is there anything legitimate she can learn? ""Safe"" deliberately leaves those questions unresolved as it watches Carol fade pitifully into a weak, sickly specter. The shadow of AIDS implicitly hangs over such a decline, but it doesn't help bring ""Safe"" to a conclusion worthy of its inspired beginning. Since his film was shown at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, Mr. Haynes has made slight changes in its latter half without really addressing that problem. The trickiest role is the small one played by James LeGros, the sappily nice guy at Wrenwood who brings the story a whiff of conventional romance. It's clear what function Chris would serve in the last reel of a more ordinary film. But he is used here more stubbornly, as a reminder that the ordinary is the last thing on Mr. Haynes' mind.""Safe"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Here is a scene that's really hard to pull off. As the mother of seven sons, Susan Sarandon tries explaining to one of them why she has carried him off the football field after he has been injured, treating him like a baby in front of his adolescent friends. It seems that when a woman has a child, the mother part of her becomes like a grow-toy, one of those creatures you put in water that expand to 300 times its size, and this ""monster mother"" part takes over, she explains. Whew! In that flashback in ""Safe Passage,"" and throughout this small, appealing drama about a family in crisis, Ms. Sarandon does the miraculous work of turning the stuff of melodrama -- an overwrought plot and strained dialogue -- into a deft portrayal of a woman who is strong-minded, self-doubting and scared for the life of one of her sons. The film begins with Mag Singer's (Ms. Sarandon) prophetic dream that one of her children is in trouble. As she goes on a paper route with her 14-year-old, Simon (Nick Stahl), the last son living at home, she runs through some possibilities. The dream could have pointed to Alfred (Robert Sean Leonard), the reserved, responsible eldest, or to Izzy (Sean Astin), the dedicated scientist. It turns out that the endangered child is Percival (Matt Keeslar), who should have been the obvious choice because he is a marine stationed with a United Nations peacekeeping force in the Sinai. When the family hears a television report that Percival's barracks has been bombed, all the sons come home to wait for word about him. As they wait, ""Safe Passage"" becomes a portrait of Mag and her life. Her husband, Patrick (Sam Shepard), has been sleeping at the office, unhappily. Mag wants a career as a social worker and has kicked Patrick out because he laughed at the idea. Patrick also has occasional bouts of blindness, and the doctors have found no cause. The role is a terrible waste of Mr. Shepard, who spends most of the film walking around the house saying whether he is blind or not. Alfred is living with a slightly older woman (Marcia Gay Harden), who happens to be a psychologist with two small sons of her own. She says psychologically comforting things to Mag. The family also includes Gideon (Jason London), an athlete who was so competitive with Percival that he blames himself for his brother's joining the Marines, and a set of twins, Merle and Darren (Philip Arthur Ross and Steven Robert Ross), who seem to have wandered in from another family or from a country-music tour. These unconvincing elements fall away when Ms. Sarandon is on screen. Her performance has just the right note of fervor: that of a woman trying hard to stay in control under terrifying circumstances; who doesn't regret her young marriage and large family, but who needs to define a new meaning for her life now that her sons are grown; who loves her husband but sometimes needs to get him out of her way. Her scenes with her youngest son are especially good, because Mr. Stahl (the boy in Mel Gibson's ""Man Without a Face"") is totally convincing as the adolescent Simon, who is beginning to find his mother's attention smothering. Without being mawkish, Ms. Sarandon plays Mag as an everyday heroine.""Safe Passage,"" which was directed by the stage director Robert Allan Ackerman, often goes too far. Mag throws herself in front of a vicious dog to save Simon, and almost kills the animal. But it is also a knowing portrait of family tensions and the tenacity of love.""Safe Passage"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes a bit of strong language and a glimpse of news film of the bombing victims.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. A little boy traveling with a Gypsy caravan through the desert in northwestern India raises his voice in a piercing lament for the fate of his people, who are destined to wander the earth. Moving through a landscape as breathtaking as a Rousseau painting, he cries: ""I will burn my horoscope that exiled me so far from those I love. I want to return to my family and run barefoot.""A group of Gypsy women gather on the street of an unidentified Spanish town and sing about the hatred they feel from the outside world. ""Some evenings, like many other evenings, I find myself envying the respect you give your dog,"" go the lyrics for this traditional flamenco ballad. An old Romanian man in a rain-swept field accompanies himself on a battered one-string violin as he sings in a high breaking voice of the destruction wrought by the regime of Nicolae Ceausescu. These scenes are among the more arresting moments in Tony Gatlif's film ""Latcho Drom"" (""Safe Journey""), an intensely lyrical portrait of Gypsy culture. The movie, which opens today at the Film Forum, is a musical travelogue that uses traditional songs instead of spoken words to evoke the unhappy history of the Rom people. From its opening desert scenes, the movie follows the westward migratory path the Roms took from India a thousand years ago. By the beginning of the 16th century, they had settled throughout Europe. Today they are most densely concentrated in Eastern Europe, especially in Romania. As the film's settings shift from Egypt to Turkey to Romania, Hungary, France and Spain, the Gypsy music changes in texture, instrumentation and style. The Indian sitar and tabla give way to the acoustic guitar, violin and accordion. But no matter what the location or the instrumentation, the music never loses its essential spirit. While the voices, harmonies and playing express a passionate forlornness, the music's relentless propulsion makes much of it almost irresistibly danceable.""Latcho Drom"" has the stylized look and feel of a movie musical. The songs follow one another like production numbers in a traveling pageant where the landscape and architecture are photographed to suggest giant stage sets. Lingering over full moons, misty fields and centuries-old buildings, the camera paints them as elements of a mystical, ever-changing backdrop. In the most elaborate numbers, Gypsy musicians, as though simultaneously heeding a mysterious call, grab their instruments, pop out of their houses and converge joyously to form spontaneous folk orchestras. Among the most effective shots are those in which the camera slowly pulls away from a scene so that the songs transcend their immediate settings to become cosmic laments lifted to heaven. For all it visual and musical sumptousness, ""Latcho Drom"" proceeds in a way that often feels bumpy and haphazard. And the information it gives is frustratingly inadequate. Subtitles translate key song lyrics, but most of the settings are not identified. Individual musicians are not identified until a final credit sequence that is more confusing than enlightening.""Latcho Drom"" is a messy cinematic tone poem to Gypsy culture. With more judicious editing and documentation, it could have been a symphony.

Safe Place':Work by Henry Jaglom Stars Tuesday Weld - The New York Times,"a mysterious mixture of childlike grace and aggressive erotisicm—but when she opens Susan's mouth, what comes out sounds like an amalgam of Chinese fortune cookie and Sir James M. Barrie. Susan, as a child, used to fly, which, she tells us, always amused her brother. As an adult in today's New York City, she finds it impossible to cope, but not, you realize, just because she has to get around on buses and subways. Susan is simply too fine and pure and vulnerable for the world that encircles her. When she isn't escaping into fantasies inhabited by a kindly old park bench magician (played by Orson Welles with an uncertain Myron Cohen accent), she may worry over the telephone company's substitution of numbers for exchanges with such names as Gramercy, Plaza and Algonquin. Like Susan, Henry Jaglom's first feature film is a beautiful drag.""A Safe Place,"" which was shown at the New York Film Festival last night, is the time-fractured story of Susan's journey to that undiscovered country from whose bourn no tourist returns, at least, not without a very special visa. Because Jaglom has chosen to use time, in his word, emotionally—through constant cutting between present and past and future—the narrative pretends to be a lot more complex than the rather superficial case history of a suicide it really is. Jaglom, who also wrote the original screenplay, looks like a young director attempting to walk without ever having learned to crawl, which is too bad because there are indications that he might crawl with a good deal of style. In fits and starts, ""A Safe Place"" is almost as moving as it wants to be, as when Jack Nicholson, an old lover out of Susan's past (who may or may not be her brother), (drops in at 4 A. M. to chat and make love, much to the comic impatience of a present lover. Jaglom, however, never lets a scene go by without splicing ing in fragments of memories of the past and fantasies of the future. The effect is not to construct a higher emotional reality, but to upstage any reality by attention-grabbing tricks. The director is, nevertheless, consistent, since this is the structural equivalent to his habit of photographing characters around and through foreground objects that tend to obscure ordinary sightlines. If ""A Safe Place"" reveals anything, it reveals the director's apparent adoration of his star, whom he studies in every possible light and color combination, and in every possible camera setup, often orchestrated with fine, corny songs out of the 1940's and 1950's on the order of Charles Trenet's ""La Mer"" and ""Vous Qui Passe Sans Me Voir."" Tuesday Weld in a tight close-up, accompanied by Trenet on the soundtrack, is not exactly a higher cinematic truth, but I can think of less stimulating combinations. Orson Welles has some terrible moments reading his fortune-cookies lines, but it's nice to see him alive and well, even if it's in Central Park trying, unsuccessfully, to make a bored llama disappear. All of the major performances are, in fact, attractive, limited only by the material. These include Nicholson, as well as two newcomers, Gwen Welles, who has a long odd, funny monologue about New York City mashers (which has no place in the movie except that it is odd and funny) and Philip Proctor, who plays Susan's square suitor with the sort of puzzled eyes and half smile that I associate with Nicholson, who may be setting the acting style for the 1970's. The film wil have its commercial opening here Oct. 29 at the new Columbia II Theater.

Movie Version of Book on Bomb Introduced - The New York Times,"man menaced with destruction by his own machines. And the pictorial presentation of it, with the cameras jumping about from the SAC nerve center to the White House—where the President is glued to the ""hot line""—and to the Pentagon, with the movement of the bombers indicated on a huge electronic plotting map, is completely in the format of the realistic science-fiction film. But the topical significance of it endows it with a special urgency, and Sidney Lumet has directed it in a fast-paced, nervous fashion that gives it momentum and suspense. It is played well, too, by all the actors (actresses have only minor roles), especially by Henry Fonda as the President, Frank Overton as the top SAC general and Fritz Weaver as an Omaha colonel who goes berserk in the clutch. In its favor, too, is the fact that, unlike ""Strangelove,"" it does not make its characters out to be maniacs and monsters and morons. It makes them out to be intelligent men trying to use their wits and their techniques to correct an error that has occurred through overreliance on the efficiency of machines. I would not say that the solution of the dilemma seems to me a sensible or likely one, but it is, at least, a valid shocker that induces the viewer to think.""Fail Safe"" will open in a group of neighborhood theaters in this area on Oct 7.

About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Nothing can hurt the Joneses, not even the obviousness of their scripts. As Ma Jones explains, thereby providing the title for the new Jones Family adventure at the Globe, there's ""Safety in Numbers."" If one of the Jones brood gets into trouble, there are enough other Joneses to rally 'round and pull him out; and if they all get into trouble, you can count on Granny or Bobby. Taken by and large, the Joneses are a powerful lot, and it would take a powerful lot of resistance (and more than we can muster) to deny the friendliness and likability of their pictures. If ""Safety in Numbers"" does not advance the family fortunes, at least it protects what little fortune Pa Jones possesses. Pa, as usual, is up to his neck in swindlers, and Maryvale, unfortunately, is with him to a man in investing its savings in the Barton Swamp Mineral Springs project. Ma Jones, meanwhile, is doing a motherly-advice program over the radio, and young Jack Jones is thinking about eloping with a stranger in town, and gangling Lucy is puzzling her 14-year-old boy friend with talk of matrimony vs. career. It works around somehow, with virtue and the Joneses triumphant, and promise of greater adventures to come. Twentieth Century-Fox has kept the family group intact, with Spring Byington as Ma, Jed Prouty as Pa, Florence Roberts as granny and Shirley Deane, Russell Gleason, June Carlson, George Ernest and Ken Howell as the assorted sons, daughters and in-laws. They are all letter-perfect now, Jonesier than the Joneses themselves, and with nothing to worry about cinematically until some one thinks up a series about the Smiths or the Browns.

"‘Rejoice and Shout,’ African-American Gospel Music - Review - The New York Times","Theologians and clergy members of every religious stripe may debate the existence of God until the cows come home. But as demonstrated by “Rejoice and Shout,” Don McGlynn’s documentary history of African-American gospel music, reasonable arguments are nothing compared with the power of voices lifted in song to invoke the Holy Spirit. Your religion or lack of one doesn’t matter. At some point while watching the film, you may feel that music is God, or if not, a close approximation of divinity. This historical survey of the genre draws heavily on the extensive archives of its producer, Joe Lauro, and is grounded in the work of two experts: Anthony Heilbut, who wrote the classic book “The Gospel Sound: Good News and Bad Times,” and Bil Carpenter, whose “Uncloudy Days: The Gospel Music Encyclopedia” chronicles the lives and careers of more than 650 gospel figures. Their analyses are supplemented by the observations of Jacquie Gales Webb, the host of a popular radio program. Mr. Heilbut’s approach is primarily scholarly and historical, and Mr. Carpenter’s is more sociological and political. Smokey Robinson, who introduces the film and offers its closing observations, sets its praiseworthy tone. The ensemble representing contemporary gospel in the film is the Memphis-based Selvy family, a sprawling multigenerational clan whose members are first interviewed sitting in church pews and near the end burst into musical life in a performance featuring the mighty voice of Darrel Petties. “Rejoice and Shout,” which initially seems rambling and digressive, snaps into focus once it begins relating a chronological history of a genre that evolved out of the fusion of plantation work songs and Christian hymns. Black gospel was first recorded at the beginning of the 20th century. The movie credits the Dinwiddie Colored Quartet, a barbershoplike group formed in a Virginia industrial school, with making the first recording in 1902 for the Victor Talking Machine Company. Tracing gospel’s development from there, the movie offers a straight lineage of innovators and followers that soon spreads out like a river delta with an increasingly complex network of branches and offshoots. In many gospel songs the Jordan River is a code name for the Mississippi, and crossing it means escaping slave territory on one side for freedom on the other. The Fisk Jubilee Singers expanded the vocabulary of gospel to emphasize vocal coloration. In the 1930s Thomas A. Dorsey, the Georgia-born Chicago preacher known as the father of black gospel music, organized the first such music publishing company. We hear the Golden Gate Quartet, a highly polished a cappella jubilee group that had the first of a series of hit records in the mid-’30s, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a preacher and guitarist who combined gospel themes with big-band and blues arrangements. Vintage footage shows James B. Davis, the founder of the Dixie Hummingbirds, swapping vocals with its phenomenal lead singer, Ira Tucker, who died three years ago after 70 years with the group. One of the most stirring clips shows the Swan Silvertones, a musically sophisticated ensemble whose crowning glory was the falsetto of its founder and tenor, Claude Jeter. The incomparable Mahalia Jackson, originally a hairdresser from New Orleans and a protégé of Dorsey’s, is shown in a strong, unvarnished performance from “The Ed Sullivan Show.” Her success illustrates a paradox of gospel: She sold millions of records but was barely acknowledged on the pop and R&B charts. To this day, except for an unpredictable mainstream hit like “Oh Happy Day,” by the Edwin Hawkins Singers, black gospel remains largely under the mass-media radar, a commercial category unto itself. The lineage continues with the elaborately outfitted Clara Ward Singers (a stage mother, Gertrude, and her daughters, Clara and Willa); the competing Five Blind Boys of Mississippi and the Blind Boys of Alabama (featured in a 1982 gospel musical, “The Gospel at Colonus”); and the Staple Singers. Mavis Staples, whose comments are woven throughout the film, recalls how in the early days of the civil rights movement, the family, led by her guitar-playing father, Pops, incorporated freedom songs and some Bob Dylan numbers into their shows. The history concludes with the Rev. James A. Cleveland, the renowned choir leader who helped train Aretha Franklin (who is not seen or heard in the film); the Edwin Hawkins Singers; the Winans; and Andraé Crouch, the seven-time Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, arranger, producer and pastor, and an architect of contemporary Christian music. A major asset of the film is its refusal to use tiny musical snippets; most of the numbers are fairly complete performances. Like nearly every other musical genre, African-American gospel is a continuing dialogue between roots on one side and technological innovation and secular influences on the other. What accounts for its integrity? It must be the inviolable core of faith at its center. “Rejoice and Shout” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mild thematic material and incidental smoking. REJOICE AND SHOUTOpens on Friday in Manhattan.

FILM REVIEW; Sex Trade's Professional Courtesy - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from December 20, 2002, Section E, Page 32Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Verónica Chen's ''Smokers Only'' is a romance from Argentina steeped in sexual ambiguity. Though its atmosphere is intriguing -- particularly in its nighttime views of Buenos Aires, where the sex trade appears to be restricted to a modern, well-scrubbed pedestrian mall -- the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression. Reni (Cecilia Bengolea) is a rootless, rail-thin bohemian in her early 20's who performs (although that may be too strong a word for her sluggish, strung-out vocals) with a moderately successful rock band. In the interests of developing their moderate success into a living wage, the other members of the band kick Reni out, leaving her in a highly vulnerable state when she runs across Andrés (Leonardo Brezicki), a young male prostitute turning a trick in full view in a brightly lighted ATM station. Hypnotized by the unlikely spectacle, Reni approaches Andrés, and soon the two of them are spending their free time together. The blithely bisexual Andrés tells his new companion that being paid for sex makes him feel powerful and desirable, and Reni, curious and by now hopelessly in love, soon joins him on the sidewalk, where they offer themselves as a pair.''Smokers Only'' (the title is a translation of ''Vagón Fumador,'' the notice that appears on the smoking car of a train) struggles with age-old themes of love and sex, and eventually it reaches an age-old conclusion: that sex without love is empty and meaningless, if reasonably profitable. Andrés's liberated stance turns out to be a cover for a fear of genuine emotional commitment, a touch of Psych 101 that abruptly turns the hip detachment of the film, which opens today in Manhattan, into conventional moralizing. Ms. Chen appears to be working under the influence of the French filmmaker André Téchiné, whose ''J'Embrasse Pas'' (1991) deals with a similar story of a young provincial who becomes a prostitute in Paris. Like Mr. Téchiné, Ms. Chen seems fascinated by the ways in which traditional romantic attitudes survive beneath the complications of a contemporary, gender-bending, polygamous sexuality, but unlike Mr. Téchiné she is quick to pontificate. She needs to trust her characters more and her judgments less.

"FILM REVIEW; A Dying Hipster Full of Song, Poetry and Sweet Nonsense - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from July 21, 2000, Section E, Page 20Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. At the beginning of ''Benjamin Smoke,'' some lines from a Patti Smith poem appear on screen, and later Ms. Smith herself appears, to recite the poem and pay tribute to the life and music of the film's subject, an Atlanta musician, hustler, and occasional drag queen known to his fans and collaborators as Benjamin. Ms. Smith's presence is especially fitting, and not only because of her personal connection with Benjamin, who opened for her shortly before he died in 1999 from liver failure linked to hepatitis C and AIDS. From Jim Morrison to Kurt Cobain, she has always been a connoisseur of rock 'n' roll martyrdom, and Benjamin, born Robert Dickerson in rural Georgia in 1960, seems to have materialized from one of her songs -- a wispy, sensitive, self-destructive soul full of sweet beatnik romanticism, pop poetry and entertaining nonsense. Jem Cohen and Peter Sillen's new documentary, which opens today at the Screening Room, is a loving piece of hipster iconography, a poignant and respectful memorial to a troubled and talented man. More impressionistic than biographical, ''Benjamin Smoke'' is a collage of interviews, performance and rehearsal clips, and evocative glimpses of Cabbagetown, the shabby, reluctantly gentrifying Atlanta neighborhood where Mr. Dickerson lived much of his adult life -- an area, as he describes it, where children build go-carts, go to jail early and watch their parents do lots of inhalants. In part because of the straitened circumstances in which it was made, the film has a richer, more various visual texture than most documentaries, combining still photographs, black-and-white video and Super-8 film, sometimes with wild sound or none at all. The ragged, absent-minded lyricism that results suits the subject. Mr. Dickerson, bone thin, his voice ravaged by ill health and cigarettes, has a hustler's easy charm. He also has a tendency to wander toward the far edge of coherence. His rambling owes something to his poet's sense of discursive possibility; it may also be a result of a life of heavy drug use. In any case, we get a sense of his taste for inspired goofing (''Tell me what a really great orgasm is like . . . It's like chicken, only a little gamier''), his fantasy life (''I used to pretend I was Claudine Longet, and I'd just murdered my ski-instructor boyfriend'') and his literary vision (a ballad about Luke Perry's feet). But we don't learn much about the details of his death and life. There is more information about Benjamin's music, his travels and his childhood in the movie's affiliated Web site (www.benjaminremembered.com)than in the film itself. The best parts of ''Benjamin Smoke'' are the musical passages, which provide necessary evidence that Mr. Dickerson was not just a colorful, doomed eccentric and which make ''Benjamin Smoke'' authentically respectful rather than lurid or condescending. His music -- chanted more than sung, over the sounds of the band Smoke, which features a droning banjo, a squalling electric guitar and a keening cello -- owes a lot to Ms. Smith and to the beatnik tradition she upholds. You may hear echoes of Tom Waits, the Velvet Underground, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs, and of the recently reissued Harry Smith Folkways compilation. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sillen should be commended for preserving this small, vital piece of American weirdness.

"FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; For Enlightenment, Her Heart Will Go On - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from October 8, 1999, Section E, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. In the trippy opening moments of Jane Campion's ''Holy Smoke,'' Kate Winslet can be found in the midst of another bohemian rhapsody. Having roamed so gorgeously through North Africa as a young hippie mother in ''Hideous Kinky,'' Ms. Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong young Australian seeking enlightenment. And the film's delirious credit sequence, complete with the film's title written in blow-away smoke letters, captures the full ecstasy of Ruth's adventure. Among the more lovable things about Ms. Campion's new film is its knowing why a grandiose Neil Diamond hit on the soundtrack will make this voluptuous, giddy sequence complete. But all is not well in the Sydney suburb of Sans Souci, where Ruth's relatives are wringing their hands about her spiritual awakening. Miriam (Julie Hamilton), Ruth's timid mother, actually ventures to India to coax her daughter back home. The mother's Indian visit ends badly, to the point where she exclaims ''Thank God it's Quantas!'' while being hoisted on a stretcher onto the airplane home. Ruth accompanies her mother back to Sydney, and it is here that the film's battle of wills begins. Ruth's family has hired a self-styled ''cult exiter,'' played by Harvey Keitel in cowboy garb, to wean Ruth away from her Indian guru. Retreating to the outback, to the picturesque environs of ''Mt. Emu Farm, Wee Waa'' ( the film's identifying titles are nothing if not fun-loving), the two of them square off for a mighty struggle. Assorted emus and oddball relatives are assembled there to keep the film fizzing as they watch Ruth come around. But as ''Holy Smoke'' moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. For one thing, the characters as written are an impressionable young woman and a tough older man. There are two fine actors here, but it doesn't help the story that Ms. Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Mr. Keitel's P. J. Waters looking overmatched. (Ms. Winslet is stunning in this role all the same.) And it doesn't help that the screenplay, by Ms. Campion and her sister, Anna Campion, threatens to become heavy-handedly ideological beneath its outward whimsy. This is a movie in which Mr. Keitel winds up in lipstick and a red dress, and in which that is seen as just deserts for his tyrannical machismo. Although ''Holy Smoke'' bears a surface resemblance to ''Sweetie,'' with its willful, misunderstood heroine and its engaging quirks, it turns out to be more fundamentally conventional than might be expected. The balance of power shifts schematically as Ruth starts rattling P. J. in ways he had not anticipated. Ms. Winslet's powerfully carnal presence dominates their scenes together to the point where P. J. is eventually drawn to violate whatever code of ethics cult exiters have. ''I was trying to be comforting,'' he later explains. As a smart, outspoken heroine of Ms. Campion's, Ruth is not about to fall for that. Shot so beautifully by Dion Beebe that it seems bathed in divine light, ''Holy Smoke'' has a sensual allure that transcends its deep-seated ponderousness. The richly colored Indian scenes have a hallucinogenic magic, while exquisite desert vistas radiate an attunement with nature. And the steamily claustrophobic look of the intense scenes between Ms. Winslet and Mr. Keitel have an eroticism that will not surprise viewers of ''The Piano.'' In addition, there are some lovely flashes of visual wit here, as when Ruth insists that she has had spiritually meaningful relationships in the past. Ms. Campion flashes on a desperately funny glimpse of high school Romeos who are forced to sparkle in Ruth's imagination. The underpinnings of ''Holy Smoke'' can be found in a none too readable current novel by the Campion sisters that does not benefit from any such directorial magic. Nor is the book graced by Pam Grier in a tiny but piquant role, the zany crowd that constitutes Ruth's extended family or the kewpie-doll sister-in-law (Sophie Lee) who finds Mr. Keitel's character tempting. She engages with him in one memorably unorthodox breathing exercise that may be intended as a feminist indictment but plays very nicely as a comic scene.

"FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; Miles to Go, and Worlds Apart - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from March 27, 1998, Section E, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. This year's New Directors/New Films series begins on a fine footing with the two warmly comic, tenderhearted road movies that are tonight's opening features. Not often are the series's first two films as sweetly harmonious as these. Though ''Smoke Signals'' is set in the American West, and the French film ''Western'' unfolds in Brittany, these films share a surprising amount of common ground. Each is a whimsical buddy story; each has a beguiling intimacy, with an emphasis on food, drink and the longing for family connections. Each, for all its seductive coziness, is about travelers who feel like foreigners wherever they go. And each knows how we invent our lives as we live them. ''Sometimes you can tell the truth more easily with lies,'' someone remarks in ''Western.'' Or, as a woman asks in ''Smoke Signals,'' ''Do you want lies or do you want the truth?'' Her companion speaks for both these films when he answers, ''I want both.''The sly, delightful ''Western,'' a peacefully scenic Cinemascope film that won the Cannes Film Festival's Jury Prize last year, hardly looks as if it has such magic at first. A traveling shoe salesman named Paco (Sergi Lopez) is conned into picking up a hitchhiker named Nino (Sacha Bourdo), who looks like a runty, hapless version of the young Bob Dylan. They make awkward small talk. Then the car breaks down, and somehow Nino manages to steal it, only to be caught and clobbered not long afterward by Paco in a picturesque coastal town. ''You know, stealing cars is not in my philosophy,'' Nino explains when Paco subsequently visits him in the hospital. To account for the heist, he says, ''Something got into me when I saw all those shoes.''It happens that while Paco was stranded, he met and quickly fell in love with Marinette (Elisabeth Vitali), who runs the local gift shop. And that Marinette wants to give the sudden romance a three-week rest. So, for lack of any better plans, Paco and Nino set out on a trip through the countryside. Before long, they are forging a friendship based on the most unexpected details, like the fact that each knows how to walk on his hands. It was crayfish for dinner when Paco was wooing Marinette, but now he and Nino enter their spaghetti days. Traveling on foot, staying wherever anyone will have them, they share a wonderful journey. Paco turns out to be Spanish, while Nino came from Russia, and the two are united by their feelings of loneliness in France. At an especially charming juncture in the story, they meet a disabled African who feels similarly estranged and who teaches them a game he calls ''Bonjour la France.'' The idea is to sit in a cafe and greet passers-by, collecting points if they answer. A man is worth one point, a woman two, a couple three. No points are scored when the stranger yells, ''Go back where you belong!''The director, Manuel Poirier, born in Peru and living in Normandy, knows all about that game and all about Paco and Nino's longings. So, of course, the filmmaker and Jean-Francois Goyet, with whom he wrote the screenplay, send them in search of women. Far from predatory, the two men are almost childlike in their ingenuous scheming. It's touching to find that good-looking Paco, who draws women away from Nino without meaning to, wants so much to help his new friend. ''You see that town?'' he says, pointing to a postcard-pretty village in the distance. ''I'm sure in that town there has to be a woman for you.'' And since France is full of such towns, he adds helpfully, ''the potential is enormous.''Brainstorm: The two will canvass the ladies of the town with a fake questionnaire. ''Does your ideal man have to be French?'' Paco asks, dreaming up one question. (Another is: ''Do you like a man who shows philosophy in his life?'') ''That's damn good,'' Nino assures him. It is, too. After all its comic misadventures, ''Western'' finds one of the men so unexpectedly lucky in love that his good fortune brings tears to his eyes. And Mr. Poirier, whose laconically funny timing often brings to mind Jim Jarmusch's deadpan style, need not compromise his film's amusing diffidence to let ''Western'' warm the heart. If Paco and Nino feel like strangers encountering Breton culture, the characters in ''Smoke Signals'' even more literally go off the reservation. Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams) are Coeur d'Alene Indians living in Idaho, characters drawn by Sherman Alexie from his sharply etched, mordant book of stories, ''The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.'' Lighter and less bittersweet on screen (and adapted by Mr. Alexie into a splendid screenplay), these tales describe a contemporary American Indian culture coming to terms with its past in offbeat, unexpected ways. These range from casual asides about George Armstrong Custer to the patter of the reservation's radio station, where ''It's a good day to be indigenous!'' is a way to greet the morning. Thomas and Victor are opposites, with their fates linked by a calamity from the cradle. Thomas was an infant when his parents, who had been drinking heavily, were killed in a fire; it was Arnold Joseph (Gary Farmer), Victor's father, who saved him. The boys have been rivals and opposites ever since. Victor is the bigger and sterner of the two, with Thomas as his screwball sidekick. It is Victor, for instance, who accuses Thomas of having gotten his ideas of Indian behavior from too many viewings of ''Dances With Wolves'' and advises him to quit grinning, start scowling and toughen up. As played by Mr. Beach and Mr. Adams, these two become enormously likable characters during the easygoing course of the story. Here is a first feature from Chris Eyre, a 28-year-old Cheyenne-Arapaho filmmaker, that has an American Indian cast and outlook. And it needs no dispensation for novelty: it stands beautifully on its own merits. Mr. Eyre presents an inviting, affectionate and witty look at contemporary Indian lives.''Smoke Signals'' stays home at first, describing such reservation fixtures as the radio traffic scout who sits parked in the middle of nowhere, filing bulletins. (''Ain't no traffic, really.'' ''Big truck just went by. Now it's gone.'') Then it moves on to the more serious business of Arnold Joseph's fate. As is gradually revealed, Arnold left years earlier to start a new life near Phoenix, damaging both boys and his battle-scarred wife, Arlene (Tantoo Cardinal) in the process. With her son, Arlene refers to this as ''your daddy's magic act -- he sawed us all into pieces, didn't he?''As childhood flashbacks reveal the boozy outbursts that colored Arnold's life with his family, his loved ones learn that he recently died far from home. So Thomas and Victor, calling a temporary truce to their own jokey rivalry, go off in search of him. ''You're leaving the Rez and going into a whole different country, Cousin,'' one young Indian woman teases. But aren't they traveling in the United States? ''Damn right it is!'' adds her girlfriend. ''That's as foreign as it gets.''We see what that means as soon as Thomas and Victor board a bus, but culture clash is not the film's main concern. Instead, it lets the two travelers reinvent their friendship in light of a new understanding of what Arnold meant to each as a father, and they discover (through Arnold's loyal latter-day companion, played by Irene Bedard) how Arnold himself struggled with the weight of the past. The film's serious underpinnings are not obscured by charming, mostly lighthearted performances or by frequent flashes of Mr. Alexie's wry humor. It's as natural as anything else, for example, for Thomas and Victor to make up a little song about John Wayne's teeth. Though this is very much a first feature (and ''Western,'' whose director's three other credits include the 1996 ''Marion,'' is for all its rustic airs a much more sophisticated one), ''Smoke Signals'' shows colorful style and a wisdom beyond precocity about its setting and its people. That's what each year's New Directors series is for.''Western'' includes a few frank sexual situations, mostly played for gentle humor. It will be shown at 9 tonight and 12:30 P.

Cigars and Conversation In the Course of Revelation - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from June 9, 1995, Section C, Page 19Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The first moments of the new film by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster remind us that Sir Walter Raleigh found a way to weigh smoke by subtracting ash from tobacco and calculating the difference. That's easier than taking the measure of ""Smoke"" itself, an inviting but evanescent film that does have casualness, curiosity value and a lot of talent on its side. Harvey Keitel, William Hurt, Stockard Channing, Forest Whitaker and Ashley Judd are among the actors breathing life into this cinematic experiment. It incongruously combines broad strokes and contrivances with offhand chitchat from the corner store. This is the first screenplay by Mr. Auster, the spare and distinctive novelist, whose methods don't always translate easily into this new medium. The dialogue can be blunt and stagy, with an emphasis on long monologues and convenient coincidence. On the other hand, Mr. Auster moves readily between the abstract and the quotidian. And this film has the actors to follow that cue. As directed by Mr. Wang with the down-to-earth warmth of his past work (including ""The Joy Luck Club"") and shot crisply by Adam Holender on well-ventilated sets, ""Smoke"" turns its title into both nicotine habit and metaphor. Much of the action revolves around Auggie Wren's cigar store on a Brooklyn street corner, where Auggie and his pals hold forth and light up. Auggie is played by Harvey Keitel, whose rock-solid presence and ever-more-fascinating resume give him the right authority to preside over a deceptively nonchalant film like this. Auggie is not only its main character, but also its good-humored host. Among Auggie's customers is the novelist Paul Benjamin (Mr. Hurt), who has been shell-shocked by the death of his wife. (Characters here tend to be defined, at least initially, by boldly explained events from the past.) It's to Paul that Auggie shows his collection of photographs, exterior shots of his cigar store taken from the same angle over 14 years. When Paul complains that the pictures all look similar, Auggie delivers Mr. Auster's most useful advice on how this film should be watched: ""You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend."" But not all of ""Smoke"" is subtle enough to reward that kind of attention. Wandering through the film with a wayward accent (and he's always better off without one), Mr. Hurt eventually matches Mr. Keitel when it comes to sly charm and well-seasoned wisdom. Like a lot of the characters here, he's also too knowing for some of the events and revelations that have been cooked up for him. Mr. Hurt's Paul finds himself suddenly entwined with Rashid (Harold Perrineau), a clean-cut young drifter who first lies about his past, then welcomes Paul's help in shaping his future. Rashid and Paul at one point jokingly introduce themselves as father and son, but Rashid's real father is Cyrus (Mr. Whitaker), who has his own painful past to resolve. Mr. Auster has said that he meant to demonstrate how talk serves as a smoke screen in ""Smoke,"" and how the characters variously do or don't reveal themselves. But the talk is often more formal than Mr. Wang's easygoing direction; that's why the other half of this project is of particular interest. Another film, the forthcoming ""Blue in the Face,"" was shot in six days in a much more improvisatory style, with Mr. Keitel and a largely different cast. Since so much of what's appealing about ""Smoke"" springs simply from character and setting, there's reason to look forward to a looser-limbed take on the same idea.""Smoke"" also features good, sharp performances from Stockard Channing as Auggie's conniving old flame and Ashley Judd as her spectacularly hostile daughter, who may or may not be Auggie's problem. A nest egg of $5,000 also drifts through the story, promising to solve all problems and loading the characters' transactions with a heady mix of larceny and love. Mr. Keitel captures that mood beautifully with the very long speech that dates back to ""Auggie Wren's Christmas Story,"" a piece by Mr. Auster on the Op-Ed Page of The New York Times in 1990, which held the first seeds of this film. The story Auggie tells is wonderful, and it's later re-enacted in a black-and-white closing sequence covering the same events he describes. It's to Mr. Keitel's great credit that he tells this tale better than the camera can show it. There's nothing ephemeral about ""Smoke"" at a moment like that.""Smoke"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some profanity.

'SMOKEY AND BANDIT' - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from August 15, 1980, Section C, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. WHEN last seen at the fade-out of Hal Needham's ''Smokey and the Bandit'' in 1977, Bandit (Burt Reynolds), his trucker buddy, Snowman (Jerry Reed), and Bandit's friend Frog (Sally Field) had trucked 400 cases of contraband Coors Beer from Texas to Georgia, to win an $80,000 bet and national fame. Snowman was preparing to return to his infrequently visited family while Bandit and Frog drove off together into a perfect future. Foiled again was the film's villain, the easily infuriated Texarkana sheriff, Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), who had unsuccessfully pursued the beer-toting truckers. At the beginning of Mr. Needham's new ''Smokey and the Bandit II,'' things have more or less come apart for Bandit and Frog. They've split, Frog to return to Junior (Mike Henry), the twerp she was about to marry early in the first film. Bandit has taken to drink, apparently in mourning for his long-gone celebrity. The only things that Bandit has to show for his brief moment of glory are 74 unsold record albums, sometimes referred to as ''The Bandit Sings Cole Porter,'' sometimes simply as ''Cheap and Superficial.'' ''Smokey and the Bandit,'' which opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters, is about the rehabilitation of Bandit, his reconciliation with Frog and the further thwarting of the apoplectic Texarkana sheriff. It is also virtually one long chase across the South as Bandit, Snowman and Frog attempt to earn $400,000 by transporting an elephant named Charlotte from a dock in Miami to a convention of Republicans in Dallas. Most important, the film is about the American economy, at least to the extent that the American economy depends on motor vehicles, their manufacture, their use and their demolition without anyone's being hurt. Like the original film, ''Smokey and the Bandit II'' has the effect of a multi-million-dollar live-action cartoon. You've probably never seen so many automobiles wrecked in so many spectacular ways over such an extended period of screen time. Considering the energy crisis, the sight of all of this uproarious destruction is a little like watching Detroit sink slowly in the west. ''Smokey and the Bandit'' is entertaining in a brainless way. Mr. Reynolds and Miss Field work attractively together, especially when they're dealing with the film's underdeveloped subtext, which has to do with the appurtenances of fame (stories in People magazine, headlines in the National Enquirer, appearances on the Johnny Carson show) both performers know so well. Mr. Reed, Dom DeLuise (as a mad Italian gynecologist who attends the elephant), Mr. Henry, Pat McCormick, Paul Williams and David Huddleston are broadly funny in the supporting roles. The film's chief asset is Mr. Gleason, whose Sheriff Buford T. Justice is probably as close as mortal man will ever get to a successful impersonation of the kind of perpetual frustration best represented by Tom, the cat in the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons. He is splendidly comic, not only as Buford but also as Buford's two brothers, Reginald, a Northwest Mountie who enters the scene with a Jeanette MacDonald look-alike, singing a duet from ''Rose Marie,'' and Gaylord, a Texas highway patrolman, whose lover appears to be a catatonic Indian brave. The screenplay, by Jerry Belson and Brock Yates, is not so surreally funny as the one for the first film, but funny lines are not what the picture is about. ''Smokey and the Bandit II'' is about movement, action, frustration and destruction, and Mr. Needham, one of Hollywood's most successful stunt artists before he became a director, is very good at this sort of thing. This is apparent in a sequence in which we see a roller coaster collapse as gracefully as a house of giant playing cards, and in the climactic confrontation between the truckers and the highway police, staged in the manner of a wagon train besieged by Indians. Not so effective is an end-credit sequence in which we are shown what are supposed to be ''out-takes,'' shots of the actors breaking up as they attempt to say their lines. This evokes television comedy of the least convincing kind. Vincent Canby ''Smokey and the Bandit II,'' which has been rated PG (''parental guidance suggested''), contains a lot of vulgar language.

"Where There's Smoke,' a Study in Blackmail, Opens - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from December 11, 1975, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. In the 1950's, André Cayatte, a French lawyer-turned-film-maker, made two films (""We Are All Murderers,"" ""Justice Is Done"") that received a good deal of favorable attention here. On the basis of everything he's done since, that acclaim seems to have been unwarranted. Mr. Cayatte's newest film to be released in this country, ""Where There's Smoke,"" virtually defines the pedestrian movie. It proceeds earnestly, step by step, from one obvious point to another, like a man walking around a golf course without clubs, just for the exercise.""Where There's. Smoke"" (II-n'y-a pas de Fumée Sans Feu), which opened yesterday at the Cinema Studio, is about political corruption in a rich Paris suburb where to be mayor, apparently, offers such magnificent rewards (whether it's power, money or simply girls, the film never says) that the incumbent party resorts to bribery, blackmail and murder to stay in office. Though Mr. Cayatte was once a lawyer, he doesn't acknowledge that there may be two sides to any question or that characters, like motives, may be mixed. ""Where There's Smoke"" is the story of the mostly successful efforts of the incumbent mayor to discredit his principal opposition, a clean-living young doctor (Bernard Fresson), by circulating a fake photograph showing the doctor's brave, loyal wife (Annie Girardot) participating in an orgy, which, if you've seen an Annie Girardot movie lately, is the last thing she would do. The film in fact is less about political corruption and the lust for power than the technology of blackmail. The only sequence of interest in the movie shows how it's possible to fake a photograph, to place one person's head on the body of another, in such a way that even laser beams cannot detect the deception. This may give you pause, if not quite making you stop and think.

Film of Williams Play Opens at 2 Theatres - The New York Times,"these few wispy moments, when the theme of frustration comes clear and one can see what Mr. Williams was pushing in this intimtate, agonized tale—are pretty much drained of their intensity by the over-powering blasts of hot, thick fumes that come out of a seemingly always torchlit production crowded with noisy characters, gingerbread scenery and bright costumes. Because of this style of production that Hal Wallis has given the film and because of the pageantesque direction that Peter Glenville has imposed, this slight, period-dress and mannered drama of small-town sweethearts who live in adjacent homes has the air of a ""Meet Me in St. Louis,"" with waiting pauses for the song, ""The Boy Next Door.""There are band concerts, gambling-house encounters rooster fights in a smoke-ringed pit and some melodramatic explosions that are made monstrous on the giant screen. A fiery-eyed Rita Moreno dashes in flouncing her skirts, from time to time as though bicycling over from ""West Side Story,"" to which she can't wait to return. Una Merkel dotters on as the heroine's mother, a comical kleptomaniac, and John McIntire snorts fire and brimstone as the hero's hysterical old man. Thomas Gomez as a gambling-hall proprietor and Pamela Tiffen as the bright-eyed, pink-cheeked girl the hero incredibly succumbs to augment the imbalance of the cast. Through it all runs a purposely insistent Elmer Bernstein musical score that finally sets one to thinking of the music played for soulful dramas in the silent days. Indeed, the conclusion of the picture, with the heroine walking off into the night with a musical-comedy traveling salesman, is almost as soulful as ""East Lynne.""The CastSUMMER AND SMOKE, screen play by James Poe and Meade Roberts, from the play by Tennessee Williams; directed by Peter Glenville and produced by Hal Wallis for Paramount.

THE SCREEN; Cowboys and Gangsters. - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from April 24, 1931, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Although it is a highly incredible story and the dialogue is often quite crude, ""Gun Smoke,"" the new picture at the Rialto, succeeds in being mildly entertaining. Had those responsible for this production tackled their task less seriously, they might have had a far better film, for it possesses the novel idea of big city gangsters invading an Idaho town and finally being killed off by a band of shrewd cowpunchers. There is enough shooting in this offering to please anybody who likes the sound of firearms. But Brad Farley, the leader of the cowboys, puts an end to the murderous career of Kedge Darvas, the head of the crooks, by throwing him over a high cliff. Darvas and his crew, who are all attired in well-cut clothes, decide to decamp from an unnamed metropolis after killing a man. They elect to hide in a small Idaho town, where they pose as men of means seeking to invest capital. The Mayor and the Sheriff, who welcome them, are extremely gullible, and so is a girl named Sue Vancey. Here and there a bright bit of work pops up in the midst of the improbable and often silly doings. Eugene Pallette, who acts the part of Stub Wallack, one of the cowboys, gives an exhibition of his marksmanship with a pistol. One of the gangsters, not to be outdone, shows himself to be as expert in shooting as Wallack. Then there is a Chinese, who is a fatalist, and is therefore not in the least intimated by the threats of the gansters to put an end to his life. The audience applauded the shooting of one of the thugs, who seemed to be bent on slaying a man for being a ""loud speaker.""The greed of the gangsters for gold causes them to cast off the cloak of respectability and shoot a couple of inoffensive persons. After these murders they not only take possession of a ranch house but, with reinforcements from the big city, they virtually rule the town, killing persons who are unfortunate enough to be heard speaking their minds. While this is going on the cowboys, are not heard from, but they come in at the psychological moment, when Sue Vancey and her servant are kidnapped and taken as hostages with the desperadoes. Farley speaks up for the honesty and wholesomeness of the wide open spaces in contrast to the lawlessness of a metropolis. In this Idaho town, which is known as Bunsen, the trustful citizens leave their safes open and men take payment for horses without counting the bills, which rather surprises Darvas and his gang. William Boyd, who was only an underling in the story of ""City Streets,"" in this current offering appears as the domineering Darvas. This gangster has a musical turn of mind and often when he is planning to snuff out a few lives he dawdles over the piano keys as he is talking to his cohorts. Mr. Boyd is forceful in his rôle and the fight he has with Richard Arlen, who figures as Brad Farley, is not without excitement. Mary Brian is attractive as Sue Vancey.

FILM REVIEW; Julia Roberts as a Rebellious Wife - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from August 4, 1995, Section C, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Nobody writes more sparkling movie roles for women these days than Callie Khouri, whose Thelma and Louise were so bright and snappish and alive. Even ""Something to Talk About,"" a more muddled screenplay by Ms. Khouri, in which a sheltered Southern wife discovers her husband's infidelity, is full of the hearty, sexy femininity that is this screenwriter's hallmark. It's rambling and unfocused, but still fresh enough to break the usual Hollywood mold.""Something to Talk About"" is also handsomely photographed by Sven Nykvist and invitingly directed by Lasse Hallstrom, who brought such amiable warmth to ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."" But that film ended with the burning of a house, and ""Thelma and Louise"" sent its heroines off a cliff. Both did a better job of creating characters than of solving their problems. Nobody has the faintest idea of how to end ""Something to Talk About"" either. The story's nominal centerpiece is Grace (Julia Roberts), the betrayed wife who is part of a close, comically unruly Southern family. Grace is married to Eddie (Dennis Quaid), but she seems to be sleepwalking through her life. The marriage barely interests her until it blows up, in a scene that is the one dramatic kernel of this sprawling story. Grace happens to be driving down the street when she sees Eddie kissing a blonde.""You marry a guy whose nickname in college was Hound Dog, what did you think was going to happen?"" asks Grace's wisecracking sister, Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick), who steals the show. Before it took on its drably generic title, ""Something to Talk About"" was called ""Grace Under Pressure,"" which gives a better idea of its real tenor. The rupture in her marriage prompts Grace to start rebelling against everything in her sedate Southern life, from the ladies' committee charged with the tough job of putting out a cookbook to the overbearing patriarch who keeps Grace under his thumb. Wyly King, played with just the right insinuating swagger by Robert Duvall, employs his older daughter as the stable manager at his horse farm, and he seems to think he rules this particular roost. But Wyly gets a comeuppance that like all this film's turns of fate, is handled with bighearted humor. And Wyly finds out that the handsome setting for ""Something to Talk About"" is actually anything but a man's world. So Ms. Khouri has filled it with lively, interesting women who trade everything from free advice to lethal recipes, like the fish sauce guaranteed to straighten out any wayward mate. (""Sometimes a little near-death experience helps them put things in perspective,"" explains the sweet, elderly lady who bestows this on Grace.) There are so many of these women that the film becomes a tangle of loose ends, but most of it is enjoyable just for the pleasure of their company. This convivial atmosphere helps hide the fact that ""Something to Talk About"" hasn't much to say about Grace's marital quandary. Eddie's role isn't as well written as his wife's, and there's not enough chemistry between the film's two leads to turn saving the marriage into a serious concern. Mr. Quaid does better with Eddie's clownish side than with his sensitive one, but it's never clear whether or how much Grace really wants him. Ms. Roberts, in an otherwise charmingly light performance, displays enough believably frayed edges to put the damper on romance. No wonder. Grace has a father who refuses to side with her (""You trying to humiliate your whole damn family?"") and a mother (Gena Rowlands) who thinks being kind to an unfaithful husband is part of a wife's role. Only Ms. Sedgwick, in a clever bit of casting (she really looks like Ms. Roberts's sister), blows the cobwebs off these family notions and helps Grace get her life back on track. Also floating through the film are Brett Cullen, foolishly underused as the dashing new man around the horse farm, and an oversupply of horse-related side action. The film's privileged setting is as good-looking as its cast, but it's also awfully . . . horsy. In the last reel, when the story collapses in a chaotic flurry of indecision, a climactic horse-jumping event does nothing to cast any helpful light.""Something to Talk About"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes brief sexual situations and some colorfully salty language, mostly from the smart-talking Emma Rae.

"‘Speciesism,’ a Documentary by Mark Devries - The New York Times","Part philosophy lecture, part animal-rights exposé, “Speciesism: The Movie” is a painfully gauche, galumphing attack on factory farming, meat eating, animal experimentation and human supremacy. So many evils, so little time. This lack of focus precludes all but the most superficial roundup of viewpoints and arguments, but it’s also completely consistent with the shock-and-awe tone and improbable naïveté of the film’s writer and director, Mark Devries. (When he says “Factory? Farms?” it’s as though he’s never heard of them.) Intrigued by the term “speciesism,” first used by the British psychologist Richard Ryder in the 1970s and which assumes human interests to be more valuable than those of other species, Mr. Devries becomes our earnest guide to his moral awakening. It’s a zigzagging journey that lurches from the media-goading campaigns of animal-advocacy groups to hog farms in North Carolina, where nearby residents rail against manure-contaminated air and groundwater. Pit stops at the American Nazi Party and the Simon Wiesenthal Center (where Mr. Devries is calmly informed that his comparison of factory farming to the Holocaust is an analogy too far) alternate with distressing clips of chicks being macerated and cattle wading in their own excrement. We’ve seen the sins of agribusiness before, in more elegant movies, but Mr. Devries, 26 (and only 20 when he began making the film), doesn’t limit himself to harassing farmers and feedlot supervisors. Committed vegans, noted ethicists and others weigh in (though, sadly, neither George Orwell nor “Planet of the Apes” is called on to suggest that speciesism may not be limited to humans). Mr. Devries’s short-attention-span style may be all over the place, but no one can say he doesn’t care.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/movies/speciesism-a-documentary-by-mark-devries.html
FILM REVIEW; Sex and the Single Hideous Monster - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from April 11, 1998, Section B, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. In the spring a monster's fancy lethally turns to thoughts of lust. This thought, reduced to a level contemptuous of taste and reasonable intelligence, underlies ''Species II.''The film is a blood-drenched, head-blasting, leaden-footed, logic-bashing sequel to the 1995 science fiction and horror show about a botched Government experiment that combines human and alien DNA, looses a viscous villain and, of course, threatens the future of humankind.''Species II'' plays it again. Now, as slime goes by, the story tells of oozing alien DNA that journeys to planet Earth in the body of the first American man on Mars. Not only is this hero, Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard), fat-free, handsome and eloquent; he is also the son of a United States Senator (James Cromwell), whose master plan is to see his son one day at the helm of the ship of state that sails out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But ''Species II'' is also partly about Eve, a key figure in this tale of the possibility of the birth of a nation of monstrous, tentacled aliens. Eve (Natasha Henstridge), who has the form of a beautiful woman, is a half-human, half-alien clone of the monster from the first film. Deprived of sex, she is kept behind glass in a guarded Government compound as the subject of sometimes painful experiments aimed at finding a defense against a future alien threat. Shortly after the Mars mission, Patrick succumbs to a couple of sisters in a Washington hotel. In a trice, hideous tentacles are out, bloody infants are bursting out of screaming women, corpses are left behind and Patrick is stashing his first offspring in an outbuilding on an unused family estate. As the body count mounts and the beastly birth rate rises, the slow-witted military-scientific establishment reacts, and an anemic counterattack begins. With the clock ticking as multitudes of infants sired by the insatiable Patrick near maturity in a glistening cocoon stage, Eve escapes for what might euphemistically be called a rendezvous with her cell mate.''Species II,'' directed by Peter Medak, who saw better days as the director of ''The Krays,''' doesn't so much stir the blood as it belabors the brain.''Species II'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes bloody murder, bloody births, exploding heads, partial nudity, shootings, simulated sex, monstrous couplings, profanity, foul language and bad parenting on the part of a United States Senator. SPECIES IIDirected by Peter Medak; written by Chris Brancato, based on characters created by Dennis Feldman; director of photography, Matthew F.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The creature at the center of ""Species"" is a result of one of those overreaching scientific experiments gone wrong. In a quiet Government lab in Utah, Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) has combined human DNA with alien DNA that was beamed down from a supposedly friendly planet. The new life form, named Sil, has a supermodel's body and face, presumably from her human genes. The deadly tentacle that whips out from her mouth and tears people's throats apart comes from the extraterrestrial side of the family. As Fitch and a team of experts track Sil through Los Angeles, this science-fiction thriller is slick and competent, but ultimately too predictable and by-the-numbers. It begins with promising strangeness, leaping into the middle of a scene that is only gradually explained. A 12-year-old blond girl is being gassed inside a chamber; Fitch is shedding a tear, though he understands that his prized creature must be destroyed, fast. (Some bad REM sleep has suggested violent times ahead.) But before the girl goes under, she crashes through the glass chamber and escapes. En route to Los Angeles, she kills a vagrant and a train conductor. She also mutates; her skin begins to bubble, she is enveloped in a huge sticky cocoon, and she steps off the train in L. A. as a grown woman (Natasha Henstridge) who somehow knows how to drive. Meanwhile, Fitch is explaining his problem to a neatly balanced team of movie types. Michael Madsen plays Press Lennox, a strong, silent guy sent by a shadowy Government agency to eliminate Sil. Marg Helgenberger, as a biologist named Laura Baker, develops a crush on him. And Alfred Molina, as a wimpy Harvard anthropologist, has a crush on her. Forest Whitaker's character describes himself as an empath, a man so sensitive that he can intuit people's feelings simply by looking at photographs of them. The empath has enough to do keeping track of the romantic triangle in front of him, much less sharing the pain of a half-alien on the run. Mr. Kingsley's Fitch is altogether too dignified in this company. Mr. Madsen and Ms. Helgenberger get most of the screen time, and they gamely liven up their functional roles.""Species"" has a few mordant scenes. Fitch says the scientists chose to make the creature a female ""so it would be more docile and controllable,"" to which the laconic Lennox says, ""Guess you guys don't get out much."" It takes the female biologist to figure out that Sil is eager to reproduce. Sure enough, they track her to a singles bar, but she eludes them. The human part of Sil quickly learns how to pick up men; the alien part has a violent overreaction to any mate she decides is unsuitable. The director, Roger Donaldson, best known for the Kevin Costner thriller ""No Way Out,"" keeps the film moving. But there is only so much suspense he can generate from this stock story and familiar-looking special effects. The Sil creature is obviously related to that snake-popping-out-of-your-stomach creature in ""Alien.""In the film's big finish, the team tracks Sil into a dank cavern beneath a sewer. It is almost too dark to see that she has turned into an eerie, skeletal creature. This new, computer-generated Sil resembles an exotic gilded puppet rather than a monster, which diminishes the horror quotient considerably. ""Species"" may work best for viewers who don't like to be too scared by horror movies; it's reassuringly familiar.""Species"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes grotesque murders and corpses, as well as some nudity, sexual scenes and strong language.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. ALAN RUDOLPH'S ''Endangered Species,'' which opens today at the Festival Theater, is a topical suspense melodrama that sounds as if it had been fearlessly torn from the headlines of your favorite supermarket tabloid. The movie is, in fact, based on fact, but the fiction that Mr. Rudolph and his collaborators have made of it is lazy. It's not worthy of the sort of journalism that can produce such headlines as ''Woman Scared to Death by Her Dentist'' and ''Storybook Romance Ends as Legless Vet Stabs Dwarf Bride.''''Endangered Species'' offers an extremely unlikely solution to the mystery of the cattle mutilations that have been reported with some frequency in Western states since 1967. Mr. Rudolph, who directed the film and wrote the screenplay with John Binder, is firmly convinced that beings traveling around in flying saucers are not guilty. He's also sure that the mutilations are not the work of ordinary predators, like wolves and coyotes. It wouldn't be fair to reveal exactly what Mr. Rudolph suspects is going on but, rest assured, he thinks big. Here is a scandal that tries - unsuccessfully - to make Teapot Dome and Watergate look like Halloween pranks.''Endangered Species,'' though dumb, is pretty and very fancily edited. The writer-director sets up the mystery effectively, with lots of cross-cutting between characters as they are introduced and shots seen from the point of view of the villains as they zero in on their victims. The principal setting is a small Colorado town and the lovely ranch country where the steers are turning up disfigured and dead. The characters who become caught up in the peculiar events include a formerly alcoholic New York City detective (Robert Urich), the town's pert, spunky sheriff (JoBeth Williams), a crusading newspaper editor (Paul Dooley), and the community's untrustworthy Mr. Big (Hoyt Axton), a wealthy rancher. All of the members of the cast act with the kind of intensity that calls attention to the awful truth that they have no material to act. The characters haven't been written - they've been ordered from L. L. Bean.

"FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW;New, Improved Virtual Reality, 1999 - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from October 6, 1995, Section C, Page 20Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. In the near future, when Los Angeles becomes a smoking, rubble-strewn crime scene and the millennium is close at hand, technology will devise bigger and better contraband. Using advanced virtual-reality headgear that taps into the cerebral cortex and touches every nerve, it will be possible to record and then sell any illicit sensation, the nastier the better. So taking part in violent crime will be as easy as loading a playback machine. And pornography will offer guilty pleasure without the guilt. As a dealer says, tempting a customer with the offer of virtual sex, ""I can make it happen and you won't even tarnish your wedding ring.""Strange Days,"" the ferocious sci-fi whirlwind that Kathryn Bigelow unleashes around this premise, explores its decadent possibilities in a kinetic, daring fashion. As the film vigorously demonstrates, a black-market trade in the vicarious means thrills without accountability, a world obsessed with sex and violence, with lurid exploitation treated as valued commodity. ""Strange Days"" explores this corruption so avidly that it happens to illustrate the same runaway sensationalism it condemns. One thing for certain about the furiously talented Ms. Bigelow (""Point Break,"" ""Near Dark,"" ""Blue Steel""): No one will ever say she directs like a girl. Operating at full throttle, using material ablaze with eerie promise, she turns ""Strange Days"" into a troubling but undeniably breathless joy ride. This film's forward momentum never stops as the last hours of 1999 slip away, hurtling toward the apocalypse with intense, vividly realized foreboding. Only when it comes time to justify its excesses and deliver on a promise of wider revelation does the otherwise audacious screenplay by James Cameron and Jay Cocks look too specific and small. As he has in his own ""True Lies"" and ""Terminator"" films, Mr. Cameron (to whom Ms. Bigelow was married) enjoys playing tricks with identity and perspective while putting very tough damsels in distress. In this case, they are a limousine driver named Mace (played dashingly by Angela Bassett as a brave new action heroine) and a singer named Faith (Juliette Lewis, once again overworking that wiggling, teasing abandon). What these two women have in common is Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes), the seedy former vice cop who now deals virtual-reality clips as if they were drugs. Lenny mopes over his loss of Faith while counting on Mace, his loyal friend, to bail him out of trouble. Trouble arrives in the form of mysterious disks that carry the vice of playback to savage extremes. Lenny is used to watching relatively innocent spectacles, like the brutal restaurant robbery that opens ""Strange Days"" or the sight of a near-naked Faith on Rollerblades. But someone wants him to see ever more sinister crime scenes, ugly episodes that take diabolical advantage of this new technology and its power to subvert and poison. It is possible, for instance, for a rapist and murderer to make his victim see herself through his eyes, with a switch in vantage point that only heightens her terror. And after that, it's possible for this high-tech sadist to save the recording for Lenny to watch. Though its crime plot inflicts yet another black eye on the Los Angeles Police Department and involves the threat of citywide race riots, ""Strange Days"" is more apolitical than that sounds. Stripped of secondary plot elements, like the sudden death of a charismatic rapper (Glenn Plummer), it actually boils down to a familiar set of film noir moves involving sexual treachery and betrayal. (Tom Sizemore, Vincent D'Onofrio and Michael Wincott are some of its tough guys.) But these particulars are dwarfed by the grandly decadent backdrop against which the film unfolds. ""Strange Days"" is visionary enough to invent a future world that appears to be on the brink of Armageddon and looks awfully close to the world we already know. As Lenny is implicated in crime, determined to stop a killer and forced to flee through nocturnal Los Angeles, Ms. Bigelow sustains a credible look while inventing one surprising and sinister tableau after another. From the forbidden thrills sold by Lenny to the nightclub where book burning is casual entertainment, ""Strange Days"" creates a brutalizing amorality and sustains it with a near-exhausting fury. The dignified Mr. Fiennes isn't effortlessly at home in a setting like this, but he slips right into the shyster's wardrobe and American accent that are de rigueur. And he does a cunningly good job of making Lenny a fine-tuned antihero. Mr. Fiennes gleefully captures Lenny's sleaziness while also showing there is something about this schlockmeister that is worth saving, despite much evidence to the contrary. As for Ms. Bassett, she looks great and radiates inner strength even without the bone-crunching physical feats to which she is often assigned. Without setting off any helpful romantic sparks, the artfully weaselly Mr. Fiennes and the rock-hard Ms. Bassett have a rapport that keeps them improbably well teamed. It helps that the camera loves both these actors, whether separately or together. And the film supplies many visually interesting ways to keep them busy, as when it puts them in a flaming vehicle and sends them hurtling off a pier. The pace of such action crescendos is more or less nonstop. With its unchecked sensationalism, high-voltage visual style and imaginatively subversive use of cyber-terror, ""Strange Days"" may reveal even more than it meant to about the future. ""Strange Days"" will be shown tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 2 P. M. as the centerpiece of this year's New York Film Festival. It opens commercially late tomorrow night at the Ziegfeld in Manhattan.""Strange Days"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

"FILM REVIEW;A Drifter, a Dog and Nonconformity in the 50's - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from October 27, 1995, Section C, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Most life- and love-affirming family films are sugary enough to make your teeth rot and unbelievable enough to seem like messages from outer space. ""Three Wishes"" works magic in a more delicate and satisfying way. Set in 1955, it is a warm and sweet tale of a single mother and her two sons who are visited by a stranger. And though the story includes a dog who may be a genie, three magical wishes and a boy who can fly, the film is rooted in ordinary life, with all its family problems. In fact, there is nothing in Martha Coolidge's beautifully made movie that can't be explained by chance or flights of imagination. The film begins in the present, with Michael O'Keefe as an unhappy father named Tom, then moves back to his boyhood. Tom's father has been lost in Korea. His mother, Jeanne, is played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as a woman of calm self-assurance and a mountain of realistic worries about raising her boys alone. Both child actors are engagingly natural. Tom's little brother, Gunny (Seth Mumy), is afraid of everything and plagued by stomachaches. Tom himself (Joseph Mazzello) longs to have a father, as his friends do. The family's suburban community is a perfect picture of bright-plastic conformity, from the green Fiesta ware coffee cups to the Memorial Day picnic at which Jeanne stands out by wearing shorts instead of a skirt. When Jeanne swerves to avoid hitting a scruffy dog on the road, she hits the dog's owner instead. He is a vagrant named Jack, played by Patrick Swayze with an air of mystery that wisely seems private rather than supernatural. Jeanne feels obligated to invite Jack to stay with the family until his broken leg heals, an invitation that scandalizes the neighbors. Things get worse when it turns out that Jack is a nonconformist. Ahead of his time, he makes sun tea. He sunbathes in the nude (discreetly hidden on screen by his chair). He coaches Tom's Little League team by teaching them not to try too hard, which leads to a scene in which the whole team sits in a circle chanting ""Om"" before a big game. ""He's a beatnik,"" the father of one of Tom's friends complains about Jack. Jeanne sees his appeal beneath the shabby white T-shirt, even though she has a more acceptable, and boring, suitor. There are just enough flights of fantasy in ""Three Wishes"" to give it a magical-realist tone. When Gunny, sick in bed, imagines monsters in his room, the monsters really turn up. And when Jack tells Gunny the story of a man and a dog, a genie in disguise who grants the man three wishes, who's to say what is make-believe?Despite its sweetness, though, it's hard to tell exactly whom this film is aimed at. Its 1950's nostalgia and message of nonconformity may appeal more to parents than to children. And small children may well be disturbed at what happens to Gunny, whose stomach aches turn out to be cancer. Despite a happy ending, that's a lot to load onto a family film. Still, ""Three Wishes"" does have a happy, if tear-soaked end. And it has emotion and charm to spare.""Three Wishes"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Its one disturbing element is the awareness of death, with Tom's missing father and Gunny's illness.

FILM REVIEW;Rimbaud: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Boor - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from November 3, 1995, Section C, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Long before there were rock stars, there was rock star attitude, as displayed with spectacular insolence by the teen-age French poet Arthur Rimbaud. Rimbaud's long shadow reaches not only into academe, where the writing he did before abandoning poetry at 20 is still much admired, but also into popular culture, where Bob Dylan, Jim Morrison or Patti Smith would not have been possible without him. Furiously hallucinogenic imagery (fueled by hashish and absinthe), bourgeoisie-skewering rudeness, mysticism, proud bisexuality and an adolescent taste for despair have all served to keep Rimbaud's legend alive and kicking. And now Agnieszka Holland's ""Total Eclipse,"" about the tortured friendship Rimbaud shared with the older poet Paul Verlaine, tries to bring that kick to the screen. Ms. Holland's eagerness to catch this lightning in a bottle should make sense to anyone who ever appreciated the drama of Rimbaud's posturing. There was, for instance, the schoolboy episode during which he disrupted the competition for a prestigious honor. History records that Rimbaud complained boorishly of hunger, wolfed down bread and butter, snickered maliciously at his classmates, picked up his pen and then wrote what proved to be prize-winning Latin verse. He was 14 1/2 and hadn't even hit his stride. But ""Total Eclipse,"" directed by Ms. Holland and written by Christopher Hampton (who studied Rimbaud's work at Oxford and adapted this film from one of his early plays), will not be winning any new admirers for the boy wonder. Unfortunately, the mad romanticism of Rimbaud's exploits has been made to look preposterous here, despite a cast that should have been magnetic in its own right. Leonardo DiCaprio, having just played another dissolute teen-age poet (Jim Carroll) in ""The Basketball Diaries,"" conveys all of Rimbaud's arrogance with little of his all-important acuity and charisma. David Thewlis, who railed his way so devastatingly through ""Naked,"" rages more noxiously and winds up rudderless here. And Romane Bohringer (""The Accompanist"") must play poor, benighted Mathilde Verlaine, who tolerates her husband's Rimbaud-related outbursts even after Mr. Thewlis's Verlaine sets fire to her hair. That is by no means the nastiest thing that happens here, since Rimbaud also stabs Verlaine, while Verlaine (during a later fracas) shoots Rimbaud.""Total Eclipse"" clumsily exaggerates both these characters, from the moment when Rimbaud begins savoring experience in a laughably over-the-top poetic manner. He tastes, drinks and stands naked on a rooftop, all of which is meant to illustrate the young artist's abandon. Meanwhile, Verlaine, who becomes smitten as soon as Rimbaud arrives in Paris, devotes many absinthe-soaked hours to cementing this new friendship while humiliating his child bride. ""I prefer your poems,"" she insists loyally, while Verlaine praises Rimbaud's brilliance. ""I really don't understand that kind of thing.""The principals' mothers are also brought into the story. Though the film wisely dispenses with Verlaine's mother, who financially supported the two poets during their fling, it presents Mathilde's mother as mysteriously determined to keep her drunken, violent, feckless son-in-law in the family. Then there is Mother Rimbaud, who lives on a humble farm in a picture-postcard setting and asks her son, ""This work that you're doing: is it the kind of thing that will lead to anything?""""Total Eclipse,"" which itself has trouble leading anywhere, drops the occasional poetic bread crumb (Rimbaud after stabbing Verlaine: ""The only unbearable thing is that nothing is unbearable"") while weaving its way through a forest of glum, sodden romance. Like Mr. Hampton's screenplay for ""Carrington,"" this one cares more for self-important snapshots than continuity, so its quarrels and love scenes don't accrue much collective weight. Graphic nudity in the film's sex scenes -- some between the two poets, others between Verlaine and the voluptuous wife he loves strictly physically -- brings no warmth to its otherwise taunting, overbearing tone. Ms. Holland's direction here lacks some of its usual polish, but that may have been unavoidable. When a film has a hero who announces, ""I decided to be a genius,"" the sort who leaps atop a barroom table to smash candelabra and urinate on a manuscript, polish is beside the point.""Total Eclipse"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, profanity, frank frontal nudity and graphic sexual situations. TOTAL ECLIPSE Directed by Agnieszka Holland; written by Christopher Hampton, based on his play; director of photography, Yourgos Arvanitis; edited by Isabelle Lorente; production designer, Dan Weil; produced by Jean-Pierre Ramsay; released by Fine Line Features. Running time: 110 minutes. This film is rated R.

FILM REVIEW; Nuttiness As Solace In a Son's Moment Of Grief - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from September 15, 1995, Section C, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Diane Keaton's ""Unstrung Heroes"" is a warm, surprising, gently incandescent film that discreetly describes a family tragedy. It's about a husband, Sid Lidz (John Turturro), who ""would say there was nothing broken that science couldn't fix,"" and his wife, Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell), who has the bad luck to prove him wrong. All this is seen, with sweet eccentricity and even improbable joie de vivre, through the eyes of the couple's worried young son, who during Selma's terminal illness turns for help to his crazy uncles. At any other time in the life of the Lidz family, the film makes clear, this would be a last resort. One a pack rat (Maury Chaykin) and the other a paranoid (Michael Richards), these uncles live together in a more artful version of the Collier brothers' domestic style. But as busy as they are saving newspapers and collecting clown pictures, they somehow find the sanity to help their nephew through an extremely difficult time. So the uncles are seen passing along their survival skills, to the point where this film becomes a celebration of quirky independence and the sustaining powers of art and memory. On top of that, ""Unstrung Heroes"" also succeeds in becoming very moving without being maudlin. There will be tears in the audience, but there aren't many on the screen. The basis for this story is a memoir by Franz Lidz, a book more grounded in authentic events than the film cares to be. Ms. Keaton and the screenwriter, Richard LaGravenese, successfully transport this material to a more whimsical, stylish level than the literal one where it started, so that (for instance) any hint of staleness or claustrophobia about the uncles' household disappears. The film doesn't need that grimness, and it has its own ideas about family life. With ""A Little Princess"" and ""The Bridges of Madison County"" to his recent credit, Mr. LaGravenese again shows himself to be an exceptionally agile screen adapter, expanding the essence of what makes a story work and knowing what to lose. This screenplay runs the risk of being generically uplifting, even bland; instead, it has a sharply distinctive flavor, honest pathos and a hint of delightful household magic. Thomas Newman's sparkling musical score echoes that buoyant tone. Early on, ""Unstrung Heroes"" captures a lovely sense of what it means for young Steven Lidz (Nathan Watt) to be happy: watching his mother smoke cigarettes and make pancakes, dancing in the kitchen while Ray Charles sings ""You are My Sunshine,"" marveling at the persistence with which his father contrives nutty inventions. (One of Sid's gadgets fills the Lidz kitchen with twinkling stars, which is the perfect visual shorthand for this time in Steven's life.) Ms. MacDowell, who makes a radiant dying swan, captures the bond between Selma and Steven even in a simple scene that shows mother and son admiring each other's hands. Mr. Turturro, an actor not usually given the chance to play domestic roles with such depth of feeling, does a touchingly fine job of conveying Sid's hidden grief and fear once Selma falls ill. Insisting to Steven and his sister that their mother has ""a very bad cold"" instead of ovarian cancer, he staves off panic by sustaining a scientist's restraint. Meanwhile, his antic brothers begin drawing Steven into their web, so deeply that they even wind up renaming him. Franz is a lot more colorful than Steven, they say. Mr. Richards, of television's ""Seinfeld,"" stalks Groucho-like through the film as Danny Lidz, who believes that there are only 8 honest people in the world. (There used to be 12, but 4 were assassinated.) An inspired choice to play Mr. Turturro's brother, he gives an entertaining comic performance and provides a fine counterpoint for Mr. Chaykin's Arthur Lidz, a wonderfully serene soul whose pockets are filled with odd artifacts wrapped in tissue paper. When Danny and Arthur take Steven, a k a Franz, to their mother's grave and observe the Jewish custom of leaving stones as remembrance, it's clear that Arthur can't stop at that. He's already left his mother old records, paperweights, a clock, a picture of Clark Gable and some dusting powder. Ms. Keaton has her own well-known fondness for unexpected artifacts, and it informs ""Unstrung Heroes"" in inviting ways. Her film has an orderly, imaginative look that stays lively without intruding on the action. And it's a look that, beyond the decorative, echoes the film's idea of how ordinary objects can be made to have meaning. Steven, learning from his uncles, begins making a secret shrine to his mother even before he loses her. In the process, he's learning that even when hope and science fail us, art survives.""Unstrung Heroes"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes very mild profanity and is eminently suitable for children old enough to withstand the sadness of its story.",http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/15/movies/film-review-nuttiness-as-solace-in-a-son-s-moment-of-grief.html

ISAAC MIZRAHI can make things out of tulle or nubuck, but his most fabulous creation is the one he has made of flesh and blood. It is Mr. Mizrahi's hilarious, happily Napoleonic personality that makes such a treat of ""Unzipped,"" Douglas Keeve's crafty valentine to the fashion world in general and this irrepressible designer in particular. And intimacy with his subject -- as both a fashion photographer and Mr. Mizrahi's former lover -- only heightens Mr. Keeve's acuity rather than compromising his perspective. Of course in terms of objectivity, it helps that ""Unzipped"" has nothing to do with state secrets and everything to do with fake fur. A smart, spiky documentary with just the right running time (76 minutes), ""Unzipped"" appreciates not only the loony excess that makes fashion such a high-stakes adventure, but also the monomania of Mr. Mizrahi's creative process. Who else watches ""The Call of the Wild"" and obsesses about the lip-liner on Loretta Young? As Mr. Mizrahi explains to the camera, if you're going to freeze on the tundra, you might as well do it with your makeup un smudged. A little while later, he is skillfully trying out the same anecdote on Polly Allen Mellen, a fashion arbiter who is enough to out-doyenne any and all of the characters in Robert Altman's ""Ready-to-Wear."" (Comparisons between the two films are invidious but unavoidable. For electricity and fun, not to mention fashion sense, this one comes out miles ahead.) Ms. Mellen listens to Mr. Mizrahi in ways that make it clear his charm is working, and that charm counts for everything in this universe. For her part, Ms. Mellen advises him to ""Be careful of makeup; be careful!"" She sounds solemn enough to be warning Caesar about the ides of March.""Unzipped"" is filled with such telling moments and lively walk-ons, not only by power-brokers and Mr. Mizrahi's business associates, but also by the celebrities who give the designer's world its spark. It's no small measure of Mr. Mizrahi's talents as a born entertainer that he can chitchat easily with gorgeous, scene-stealing supermodels (Cindy Crawford talks about her pores, Naomi Campbell about her navel ring, Kate Moss about appearing in her underwear, etc.) and leave no doubt about who is the star of this show.""Unzipped"" is neatly structured to follow Mr. Mizrahi through the creation of a single collection, which begins in disaster. When first seen, he is crushed by reviews of his last designs (""Certainly his sense of how a modern woman dresses after 8 P. M. failed him"") and is about to start again at square one. The film understands that this process can look silly while being deadly serious. And it enjoys watching while a man who loves his work and lives vividly in his imagination -- a fun place to be -- tries out ideas. He's not even really kidding when he daydreams about a fake-fur jumpsuit, perfect for dog-walking, that could work in one of two environments: Alaska or the Upper East Side. Mr. Mizrahi is seen auditioning models, talking fabrics, working on sketches and gossiping madly about everyone he meets. (He does a dandy impersonation of Eartha Kitt, whose real presence is smoothly intercut with the Mizrahi version.) Throughout all of this, it's also clear that he is driven rather than frivolous, controlling his employees and the camera crew with equal precision. When one scene finds him ambushed by upsetting news -- Jean-Paul Gaultier has done a Nanook look before the completion of the Mizrahi version -- he simply puts his face in his hands and refuses to move. That's not as good as yelling ""Cut!,"" but it's the next best thing. The candor of ""Unzipped"" may be as contrived as the pouf skirts, but that doesn't lessen its appeal. After all, in what other culture can you overhear people saying ""punk and Hasidic"" and have the slightest idea what they mean? (They mean a fashion gaffe by Gaultier.) Even the film's carefully controlled scenes can be revealing, as in its glimpses of Sarah Mizrahi, who beams at her boy and says ""My Isaac made this"" with motherly pride. She is all maternal encouragement until, when teased by Isaac, she insists: ""That's not funny at all. I have a very good eye.""(Only Mary Tyler Moore in her Mary Richards days seems to rival Isaac's mother as a feminine influence on him. Whatever that means, this film knows enough to leave it unexplained.)Edited to capture the mounting drama of staging a collection, and filmed by Ellen Kuras in a fluent variety of camera styles (grainy black and white to accentuate the workaday fashion world, exuberant color for the finished clothes), ""Unzipped"" builds its tension until it reaches the big day. It looks on as Mr. Mizrahi changes from life of the party into drill sergeant, frantically finishing the clothes and insisting on a see-through ballet scrim to partly shield the models who are backstage. That idea itself becomes a theatrical triumph. Then the crowd gathers and the show begins. It is alluringly ""insane with color"" (as Women's Wear Daily will later gush), and yes, it is exciting enough to make sense of this whole enterprise. You may recall that ""Ready-to-Wear"" tried to lend thrills and meaning to this crowning moment by sending models down the runway stark naked. But ""Unzipped"" doesn't have to be that unzipped. It knows why clothes work better.""Unzipped"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes mild profanity.

Review: ‘Victor Frankenstein’ Recasts a Tale That Keeps On Giving - The New York Times,"You cannot keep a good monster down, especially when there’s franchise money to be made. This doubtless explains “Victor Frankenstein,” a pop romp that exhumes Mary Shelley’s famous monster-maker for a jaunty bromance with his bestie, Igor. It’s a hyperventilated resurrection that owes less to Shelley (or most Frankenstein flicks) than to Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes diversions, which turned Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) into 19th-century action heroes complete with cheerfully deployed violence and self-regarding smiles. Shelley didn’t give Victor Frankenstein a lab lackey, though plenty of filmmakers have. In “Son of Frankenstein” (1939), the assistant is called Ygor and, somewhat confusingly in terms of monster genealogy, played by Bela Lugosi, of Dracula immortality. He’s Igor here in this new movie and played by Daniel Radcliffe, who continues to take on roles that seem calculated to stick a fork in Harry Potter as deeply as possible. Hunched and filthy, Mr. Radcliffe’s Igor enters head down and cowering, more beast than man. A whipped dog, Igor works as the lowest-level circus performer, a job that mostly entails his serving as the center attraction in a brutal round of kick the can. Victor, in turn, is played with a lot of physical dash and a crazed smile by James McAvoy, who all but hurls himself into the fray. He and Mr. Radcliffe make a fine pair of scoundrel-heroes, particularly after Victor rescues Igor from the circus and performs an amusingly revolting operation featuring a siphon and bucket of pus before shooing him off for a shower and a shave. Igor cleans up nicely and then, with a back brace, straightens out agreeably, becoming Victor’s well-coiffed match. Handily, Igor also turns out to be a genius of a kind, an expert draftsman and amateur sawbones who’s eager to help Victor with some of his dodgier scientific experiments. Thin as a halfpenny, “Victor Frankenstein” has nothing to offer on science and the mysteries of creation, but it does reaffirm the grip that Shelley’s story retains on the imagination, no matter how far afield it’s taken. (This version was written by Max Landis and directed by Paul McGuigan, who also directed episodes of the BBC show “Sherlock.”) “Victor Frankenstein” promises new directions and other movies, mostly by recasting a story about gods and monsters into a buddy movie. It’s vaguely cute, even if, despite the floating eyes and other attractions (notably Jessica Brown Findlay as a trapeze artist), the detective (Andrew Scott, best known as Moriarty in “Sherlock”) who tries to ruin Victor’s party can’t help turning your thoughts from Shelley to Doyle. “Victor Frankenstein” is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned). Vivisection and other violence. Running time: 1 hour 49 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/movies/review-victor-frankenstein-recasts-a-tale-that-keeps-on-giving.html
"‘I, Frankenstein’ Stars Aaron Eckhart as the Lonely Ghoul - The New York Times","Mary Shelley’s famous motherless child enters the angels-and-demons world of an apparent franchise bid in “I, Frankenstein.” Stuart Beattie’s solemn, ho-hum film largely shuns Shelley’s anguished creator as a character and turns his lonely monster into a football between the forces of good and evil: protective gargoyles and demons who covet his secret to immortality. Somewhat scarred, mostly expressionless, the modern monster (Aaron Eckhart) stalks an empty, anonymous burg in an overcoat and fingerless gloves. He’s been moping for two centuries, as an introduction explains, and he’s nonplussed by existence. Christening him Adam, the gargoyles’ leader, Queen Leonore (Miranda Otto), fends off interested demons led by Naberius (Bill Nighy), who has hired an unwitting scientist (Yvonne Strahovski) to crack this reanimation thing. The two sides come to blows, needless to say, and Mr. Beattie stages air battles and hand-to-stick combat with a fireball effect that grows almost comically laborious. There are some clean, comic-book compositions and neat architectural interlacing, but the blinkered screenplay and indifferent performances fail to lift the eschatology and self-searching off the page. Mr. Eckhart shuts himself down rather too thoroughly, and if there’s such a thing as valiantly insinuating, Mr. Nighy does it as he tries to shock life into the featureless dialogue. Mr. Nighy’s presence is part of a certain overlap with the “Underworld” series, in which he also appeared. Like those post-apocalyptic struggles, “I, Frankenstein” is the brainchild of Kevin Grevioux, who here also lends his bulk and bass voice to the role of Naberius’s security chief. Having established a downbeat, even stoically plain tone, this economical affair feels like a canvas prepped for, and awaiting, further detail (or straight-to-video-on-demand sequels). “I, Frankenstein” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for remarkably undisturbing sequences of intense fantasy action and violence throughout.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/movies/i-frankenstein-stars-aaron-eckhart-as-the-lonely-ghoul.html
‘Frankenstein’s Army’ Pits World War II Soldiers and Cyborgs - The New York Times,"archetypes like the hotheaded Vassili (Andrei Zayats), the timid Sacha (Luke Newberry) and the handsome, sympathetic Sergei (Joshua Sasse) — behind enemy lines. Before long, they encounter corpses whose innards are bursting with circuitry. A brutal raid on a humble village leads the troop to an underground lair where a mad scientist (Karel Roden), the great-great-grandson of Baron von Frankenstein, has been grafting body parts and scrap metal to create a horde of highly inhospitable cyborgs. These “zombots” (conceived by Richard Raaphorst, a longtime conceptual artist for movies, making his feature directing debut) suggest a kind of midcentury steampunk. One incorporates a drill snout, another a deep-sea-diving helmet. Their names include Razorteeth (whose head has mandibles reminiscent of a Venus fly trap), Mosquito Man (with stiltlike appendages) and the self-explanatory Propellerhead. Faded color and overexposed-celluloid textures add antique flavor, as does the refreshing absence of digital effects for the creatures. Narrative depth may be in short supply, but the energy, invention and humor are bracing. And let’s face it: Sometimes cheese tastes good. “Frankenstein’s Army” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for ripped intestines and an unholy human-teddy-bear hybrid.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/movies/frankensteins-army-pits-world-war-ii-soldiers-and-cyborgs.html
Frankensteins Bloody Nightmare - Review - Movies - The New York Times,"The lack of apostrophe in the title is just one of the many confounding things about “Frankensteins Bloody Nightmare,” a 1970’s-style horror oddity that could pass for a perverse experiment masterminded by a mad scientist. Reportedly made for less than $2,000, the film stars John R. Hand, who also wrote, directed, produced and edited, as Victor Karlstein, a giggling, increasingly deranged doctor. Victor builds a robotlike creature that murders so he can obtain body parts to reassemble and eventually revive his dead girlfriend. Or something like that. More interested in trippy visuals than storytelling, Mr. Hand’s peculiar assemblage of quick cuts, slow pans and extreme close-ups, shot on Super 8 and mini-DV, is either so grainy or so saturated in reds, greens, blues and purples that it’s often difficult to make out exactly what’s happening on screen. And the sound is so frightfully bad it’s even harder to decipher the dialogue spoken by the amateurish actors. Yet purely for curiosity’s sake this unusual, intermittently hypnotic quasi monster flick is worth checking out, at least until the initial “what is this?” effect wears off and it becomes as tiresome as listening to someone relate long-winded tales about nightmares or drug-induced exploits. FRANKENSTEINS BLOODY NIGHTMAREOpens today in Manhattan. Written, produced, directed and edited by John R. Hand; music by the Greys; released by JRH Films. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 77 minutes. This film is not rated. WITH: John R.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Consider ""No one can create a soul.""Or, ""My God, Victor, what have you done?""Or, ""It is an abomination in the eyes of God!""Great lines like those cannot die but, like Dracula, they live only in the dark, in movies, many of which have been made on astonishingly low budgets by Roger Corman. In the 1960's, Mr. Corman, who has a sense of humor and a nose for what sells, provided the training ground for such young cineastes as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Jonathan Demme. He also directed a number of financially successful horror and science-fiction films on his own, the best being a series of neon-gaudy camp classics purloined from the works of Edgar Allan Poe. More recently he has been producing and distributing the movies of others. Now, however, he comes back as an auteur to be ranked with the men who made ""Fellini's Satyricon"" and ""Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,"" at least in terms of titles. Mr. Corman's breakthrough work: ""Roger Corman's Frankenstein Unbound,"" which is not to be confused with Percy Bysshe Shelley's ""Prometheus Unbound,"" though Shelley turns up as a character in the Corman work. So do a lot of other unlikely characters, including Lord Byron, Mary Godwin, the demented Victor Frankenstein, his monster, and a benign but imperfect 21st-century scientist named Dr. Joseph Buchanan, played by John Hurt. As it always does in such fiction, this mixture of sci-fi and horror begins when somebody goofs. There are, after all, some things best left to God. In trying to come up with a weapon that will render an enemy harmless but not dead, Buchanan has been fooling around with implosion. But implosion is a tricky business. It's a cosmic banana peel. It makes ""time slips"" possible. Before the movie is 10 minutes old, Buchanan has slipped accidentally back to the lazy summer of 1816 in Switzerland when Shelley, Mary Godwin and Byron were scandalizing the natives on the shores of Lake Geneva. It is the conceit of Mr. Corman and his associates that when Mary Godwin was writing ""Frankenstein,"" she wasn't writing fiction but only a thinly veiled account of a rather rude if well-to-do neighbor named Victor Frankenstein. More about the story you need not know. The movie, actually filmed in Italy around Bellagio and in Milan, looks fine, and the performers are mostly good. In addition to Mr. Hurt, the principal players are Raul Julia (Frankenstein), Bridget Fonda (Mary), Jason Patric (Byron), Michael Hutchence (Shelley) and Nick Brimble (the monster). Miss Fonda, ordinarily a charming actress, plays Mary as if she were Annette Funicello in an early-19th-century blond fright wig. Mr. Brimble's Monster looks the way Alexander Godunov might look after a failed face-lift. The special effects are nicely spaced out, and the laugh lines fairly funny.""Roger Corman's Frankenstein Unbound,"" which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), presents a lot of purposely overstated gore, including one scene in which Frankenstein's monster uses his severed arm as a billy club.

Screen: Butchery Binge:Morrissey's 'Warhol's Frankenstein' Opens - The New York Times,"just as belching was said to compliment the hosts of ancient China. While one suspects that the tales about upchuck at ""The Exorcist"" were eagerly exaggerated, ""Andy Warhol's Frankenstein,"" written and directed by Paul Morrisey, almost begs the gorge to rise. Hence those with iron guts may rank as Philistines — unable to respond to the call of art. The movie opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and West. A fascistic baron (Udo Kier), who plans to create and control a new master race, assembles beautiful rigid zombies out of freshly killed spare parts. As his hands caress kidneys, spleens and gall bladders, his unfinished creatures appear like mutilated corpses, and disembowelment becomes a substitute for sex. (Some of the innards resemble lobster salad, an evocation that stresses the obvious expense of this production.) Throughout, the accents of the wicked are as thick as minestrone—""Let's get rrrid of ziss useless trrrunk"" — and the blood splashes as noisily as an open fire hydrant.3-D effects (summoning wistful memories of ""House of Wax"") are used to project the butchery: Dripping giblets on forceps are thrust into the audience, while the performers — including Joe Dallesandro as a sulky stud and Monique Van Vooren as the baron's huffy wife and sister — practically leap into your lap. Since much of the action is slow, these diversions are welcome, although hanging onto the 3-D glasses can be rough if you're a nearsighted, note-taking smoker. In a muddy way, the movie attempts to instruct us about the universal insensitivity, living-deadness and the inabilty to be turned on by anythng short of the grotesque. However, this ""Frankenstein"" drags as much as it camps; ""despite a few amusing moments, it fails as a spoof, and the result is only a coy binge in degradation.

While this thesis has the weight of antiquity with it, it makes for a tedious object lesson as presented in this subtitled Greek-language film about an outcast merchant marine officer who learns to love a pretty crippled girl. The girl and seaman are brought together in a very round-about fashion, after we learn through a flashback that the seaman was disgraced by another woman who tricked him out of his ship's money. Somewhere along the way, he learns to desist from his hope for revenge and this softens him for love. One interesting thing is that these concepts reflect the continuing influence in Greek life of the great ancient classics. This, however, is the only rerespect in which ""Wind of Hate"" resembles them. WIND OF HATE (""O Anemos Tou Missous""), screen play by G. Assimakopoulos and N.

As if by grim coincidence ""I Was a Teenage Frankenstein"" arrived at the Paramount yesterday at a time when the city's newspapers were carrying banner accounts of the deepening crisis brought on by teen-age violence. It is difficult to disassociate what was happening on the screen from the day's occurrences in the real world. Both were concerned with acts of physical violation. If you discount any immediate connection between the mass media and the temper of the culture, then the film warrants little attention. It is the old story of the mad scientist, played by Whit Bissell, who wants to advance human progress by creating the ideal human being. In this case, however, the automaton, enacted by Gary Conway, is a teen-ager assemble from the limbs of other teenagers. This is, in one sense, abhorrent. It forces one to acknowledge the impression that such films may aggravate the mass social sickness euphemistically termed ""juvenile delinquency."" Since a whole series of movies slanted to the teen-age market is expected in the months to come, it may be as good a time as any to raise the question of what effect this further indulgence of the cult of ""teenism"" ultimately could have. In this particular film, there are graphic displays of human dismemberment. Before one such act of surgical perversion, the mad doctor' assistant says, ""I have no stomach for it.""That would be a plausible reaction for any adult who had read the day's headlines about teen-age crime.

Screen: Routine Horror; 'Curse of Frankenstein' Bows at Paramount - The New York Times,"and we wonder if there are many such people, outside of very young kids—may remedy this social shortcoming by hopping in to see ""The Curse of Frankenstein."" This British-made film in color opened at the Paramount yesterday. Here, in this routine horror picture, which makes no particular attempt to do anything more important than scare you with corpses and blood, the most famous monster of screen fiction comes to life and goes clomping around again, smashing the baron's apparatus and choking people with gray and bony hands. We can't say that the British technicians who put together this morbid exercise have gone overboard in improvising on Mary Shelley's 140-year-old tale. Everything that happens in their picture has happened the same way in previous films. Baron Frankenstein still creates a monster out of a human cadaver and spare parts that he picks up by robbing a gibbet and poking around fresh graves. And the creature he manufactures in what looks like a pickle barrel is not unusually gruesome, as Frankenstein monsters go. It is just a big, clumsy ruffian with a face that even a mother couldn't love and a cantankerous disposition. Inside is Christopher Lee. In the role of the baron, Peter Cushing likewise does a conventional job. He might be a do-it-yourself addict constructing a rocking-chair. And Robert Urquhart as his horrified associate, Hazel Court as his trusting fiancée and Valerie Gaunt as a too-nosey servant come through tepidly. This one should be cold-cuts for old-timers who remember Boris Karloff as the get of Frankenstein, but it may titilate the blissful youngsters. We noticed yesterday morning that there were a couple of squeaky screams.

Universal, generous to a fault, has presented as complete a gallery of ghouls as ever haunted a Hollywood set in ""House of Frankenstein,"" the horror spectacle which arrived at the Rialto yesterday. A necrology of the inmates of this macabre manse includes practically everyone in Universal's vicious varsity from Dracula to that eminent werewolf, Lon Chaney. It's like a baseball team with nine Babe Ruths, only this grisly congress doesn't hit hard; it merely has speed and a change of pace. As such, then, it is bound to garner as many chuckles as it does chills. However, lampoon or no, put this item down as a bargain for the bogie hunters. Having spent fifteen years in an especially dank dungeon for the odd medical practice of transplanting the brains of corpses into dogs, it is only natural that Boris Karloff would be a man in white with a black hate. So, when he escapes during one wild, stormy night, the odds are that the ensuing carnage will be colossal. It is. Aided by his baleful buddy, the hunchbacked J. Carrol Naish, a truly remarkable script, and a welter of pseudo-scientific gimcracks, Dr. Karloff spends his time reviving those familiar worthies, Dracula, a frozen Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster. The necromancy thereafter is completely nightmarish. And, although they all finally fade into celluloid limbo, it's a safe bet they'll return. For the boys' current visit, however, wolfbane or the like is not a necessary protective measure. A tongue in cheek and an open mind should do it. HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN; screen play by Edward T.

Don't look now, gentle reader, but Frankenstein's monster is loose again. Out of that deadly bed of sulphur into which he was last seen to plunge, Universal has hauled the foul creature and set him to roving once more on the scabrous screen of the Rialto in a film called ""The Ghost of Frankenstein."" Gorgons, hydras and chimeras dire! Aren't there enough monsters loose in this world without that horrendous ruffian mauling and crushing actors? For that, as a matter of fact, is about all he does in this film, except to submit to an operation whereby the sinister Dr. Lionel Atwill removes the brain from Bela Lugosi and pops it into him. To be sure, the replenished monster is being consumed by fire when we see him last, but the thought that he may yet return for further adventures with his body and Lugosi's sconce fills us with mortal terror. That is the most fearful prospect which the picture manages to convey. That Monster's BackTHE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN, screen play by W.

At the Roxy. - The New York Times,"of all things—begging Frankenstein (Colin Clive, once more) to create a mate for him along the same general pattern. In more ways than one, this is a changed Monster. At first, one must recall, he was pretty much of a thorough-going brute, a killer for the killing's sake. Now, possibly under the unfluence of Spring at Universal, he is slightly moonstruck, hungry for kindness and even—oh, perish the thought—for love. He learns to speak, to smoke cigars and drink wine. ""Good,"" he says gluttonously, and points to the things he wants. ""Bad!"" he growls and shakes his square and metal-clipped head at fire. One will be amused at his softening, but it will be respectful amusement; one would not dare to laugh: he might snarl. And so, driven by one force and another, poor Frankenstein and the wild-eyed Dr. Pretorious (who has experimented himself and created tiny humans which he keeps in small glass jars) go back into their laboratory, exhume more bodies, obtain a fresh human heart, harness again the power of the storms and convert Elsa Lanchester (Mrs. Charles Laughton in private life) into a bride for the Monster. It is rough on Miss Lanchester, but nothing to what happens to the lovelorn, calf-eyed Mr. Karloff. The picture again ends with the apparent demise of the Monster—and his mate—but Mr. Karloff's best make-up should not be permitted to pass from the screen. The Monster should become an institution, like Charlie Chan. Mr. Karloff is so splendid in the roôle that all one can say is ""he is the Monster."" Mr. Clive, Valerie Hobson, Elsa Lanchester, O. P. Heggie, Ernest Thesiger, E. E. Clive and Una O'Connor fit snugly into the human background before which Karloff moves. James Whale, who directed the earlier Picture, has done another excellent job; the settings, photography and the make-up (contributed by Universal's expert, Jack Pierce) contribute their important elements to a first-rate horror film.

"THE SCREEN; A Man-Made Monster in Grand Guignol Film Story-- Lawrence Tibbett as a Singing Marine. Farce and Melody. The Up and Up."" A Sailor's Dilemma. Martin Johnsons in Africa. - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from December 5, 1931, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Out of John L. Balderston's stage conception of the Mary Shelley classic, ""Frankenstein,"" James Whale, producer of ""Journey's End"" as a play and as a film, has wrought a stirring grand-guignol type of picture, one that aroused so much excitement at the Mayfair yesterday that many in the audience laughed to cover their true feelings. It is an artistically conceived work in which Colin Clive, the Captain Stanhope of the London stage production of the R. C. Sherriff play, was brought from England to act the rôle of Frankenstein, the man who fashions a monster that walks and thinks. It is naturally a morbid, gruesome affair, but it is something to keep the spectator awake, for during its most spine-chilling periods it exacts attention. It was Carl Laemmle, head of Universal, the firm responsible for this current picture, who presented Lon Chaney in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" and while, as everybody knows, Quasimodo was a repellent sight, he was a creature for sympathy compared to the hideous monster in this ""Frankenstein."" Boris Karloff undertakes the Frankenstein creature and his make-up can be said to suit anybody's demands. He does not portray a robot but a monster made out of human bodies, and the reason given here for his murderous onslaughts is that Frankenstein's Man Friday stole an abnormal brain after he had broken the glass bowl containing the normal one. This Frankenstein does not know. No matter what one may say about the melodramatic ideas here, there is no denying that it is far and away the most effective thing of its kind. Beside it ""Dracula"" is tame and, incidentally, ""Dracula"" was produced by the same firm, which is also to issue in film form Poe's ""Murders in the Rue Morgue.""There are scenes in Frankenstein's laboratory in an old windmill, somewhere in Germany, where, during a severe electric storm, the young scientist finally perceives life showing in the object on an operating table. It is not long after that the monster walks, uttering a sound like the mooing of a cow. And then ensues the idea that while Frankenstein is proud of the creature he has made and boasts loudly about his achievement, he soon has reason to fear the brute, and in course of time it attacks Frankenstein's faithful servant, a bowed and bent little man, and kills him. The scenes swing here and there to the Baron, Frankenstein's father, efficiently acted by Frederick Kerr, to those of a friend named Victor, played by John Boles, and to Elizabeth, Frankenstein's fiancée, portrayed by Mae Clarke. This is a relief, but they are all anxious about what Frankenstein is doing. They learn at the psychological moment, and have then still greater anxiety for Frankenstein. Imagine the monster, with black eyes, heavy eyelids, a square head, huge feet that are covered with matting, long arms protruding from the sleeves of a coat, walking like an automaton, and then think of the fear in a village, and especially of the scientist, when it is learned that the monster has escaped from the windmill. It is beheld parading through the woods, sitting down playing with a little girl, and finally being pursued by a mob with flaming torches, for apparently fire is the only thing that causes the monster to hesitate. The sounds of the cries of the pursuers and the strange noises made by the monster add to the disturbing nature of the scenes, and in a penultimate episode there is the struggle between the monster and Frankenstein. As a concession to the motion picture audience, Frankenstein is not killed, but he is badly injured. Two endings were made for this production, and at the eleventh hour it was decided to put in the one in which Frankenstein lives, because it was explained that sympathy is elicited for the young scientist and that the spectators would leave disappointed if the author's last chapter was adhered to. As for the monster, he is burned when the villagers set fire to the windmill. From the screen comes the sound of the crackling of the blazing woodwork, the hue and cry of the frightened populace and the queer sounds of the dying monster. Mr. Clive adds another fine performance to his list. He succeeds in impressing upon one the earnestness and also the sanity of the scientist, in spite of Frankenstein's gruesome exploits. Lionel Belmore gives an easy performance as the town burgomaster. Miss Clarke, Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye also serve well.

""The Cuban Love Song,"" Lawrence Tibbett's new film, which is now at the Roxy, is on the whole an effective entertainment. It is true that the story is uninspired and somewhat cumbersome, but there are bright lines in the dialogue and, what is ever welcome, Mr. Tibbett's gift of song. Mr. Tibbett appears as Terry Burke, a young man of good family who, on an impulse of the moment, joins the marines. His buddies, known as Romance and O. O. Jones, are impersonated respectively by Ernest Torrence and Jimmy Durante. They are assuredly a discordant trio, but they seem to enjoy each other's company. It is a picture that would benefit by less of Mr. Durante's brand of humor and more of Mr. Tibbett's singing. The vivacious Lupe Velez plays Nenita, the obstreperous Havana peanut vendor with whom Terry falls in love. Miss Velez dances energetically; she also adds her voice to some of the interludes of melody and volleys away in Spanish. W. S. Van Dyke, the director, has done well by most of his scenes, especially the sequence in which Terry is taken to a Cuban police station at Nenita's behest, and another in which he helps her by his singing to sell her peanuts. It is for the most part a rollicking affair which, when it does take itself at all seriously, becomes lethargic and rather dull. The World Warreceives a few instants and then ten years pass in a flash. Toward the close there is the return to Cuba, O. O. Jones having boarded the steamship for that island, believing, as he says, that it was the Hoboken ferry. It has long been a mystery to Romance and Terry concerning what Jones's initials stand for, but at a final stage of the proceedings it is revealed that his given names are Osmund Obadiah. It is a tale of marines going to Cuba, having a high old time, what with driving a flivver, meeting Nenita through crashing into her donkey cart, and then Terry's little affair of the heart. Besides singing ""The Peanut Vendor,"" Mr. Tibbett lifts his strong voice to the lilt of the popular marine song, also to ""The Cuban Love Song,"" and to a chantey called ""Tramps at Sea."" But besides his singing, Mr. Tibbett displays talent for comedy. In fact he looks as though he were enjoying his scenes. This Terry has an American sweetheart, played by Karen Morley, who has every reason to throw him overboard. She has, however, more faith in Terry than most girls would have, especially when at the end he brings home Nenita's child, who is named Terry. Farce and Melody.

Phillip CooperThe small fry of the underworld, the bookies and those who nibble on the fringe of the big money, are saying their say for the microphones from the Warner Theatre screen in ""Reckless Living,"" which is based on the stage play ""The Up and Up."" They draw ingenious distinctions between what is ""legitimate"" in the rackets and what is not. Making bad gin and whisky, they explain, is all right because they can get away with it. Accepting racing bets is more profitable but also more dangerous, because they realize that there is a law against betting on the races. Played expertly and with some degree of truth by Ricardo Cortez, Mae Clark and Norman Foster, it makes fair enough entertainment that is revealing in its atmosphere and meager in its story. Bee and Doggie are going straight, because they love each other and also because they are afraid of the law. They run a little apartment, speakeasy, making their own booze, and they are saving their money to buy a gas station in New Jersey. But Doggie likes to play the horses, and the dice also have an enormous fascination for his twitching fingers. The big shot in their professional life is Curley, who loves Bee and in his spare time is the king of the bookmakers. When Doggie gambles away the last of their little capital, Curley sets the couple up in a fashionable apartment, behind which he operates. In the argot of the underworld they are operating a front for him. That is still ""legitimate,"" but not so much so. The police might not know where the line stops. In the end Doggie braces up and buys his little gas station in West Orange. His transformation is miraculous and pretty dull, but the police raids and the operations of the bookmakers are interesting. Cyril Gardner's direction is competent and conventional.

Brooks Benedict""His Woman,"" which was known as ""Sal of Singapore"" during most of its journey through the studied mills in Astoria, blew feverishly across the Paramount's screen yesterday. It opens in one of those cinematic hell-holes in the Caribbean, where the sailors order gin straight and the dancing girls draw red roses across their lips to show the devil in them. Into this maelstrom of dank passions stalks honest Sam Whalan, skipper of a tramp freighter. He pushes a Spaniard. The Spaniard pushes back. Sam is a little tight, so he picks up a chair and dashes madly about in all directions. Maybe it is the camera, but Sam seems to be giving an imitation of an old woman stirring pudding as he swings his chair. That is only the beginning of Sam's adventures. There are many more laughs later on; some of them intentional. As melodrama, ""His Woman"" never manages to be convincing, or even very interesting. Its humor is a little better. When Sam staggers back to his ship and finds a baby outside his cabin, life becomes complex. He learns to like the little vagrant and he fumbles with milk bottles while his crew shakes its collective head. When he brings Sally Clark on board to give the baby a woman's care, trouble starts all over again. Sally claims to be a missionary's daughter, but the first mate knows better. He leers evilly at her, and Sam, who is better with his fists than with chairs, knocks him overboard. That is murder. It takes ""His Woman"" a half hour more to clear the decks for the wedding. The most effective member of the cast is the baby, a rather remarkable infant who is complete master of his limited emotional equipment. Gary Cooper and Claudette Colbert give their usual competent performances in the leading rôles, but they are beaten down by the general burlesque qualities of the story. When Mr. Cooper drinks frantically to forget his sorrow, the audience snickered. When Miss Colbert has a hysterical fit and announces shrilly that she is going back to her old life, the audience turned around and smiled at its neighbor.""His Woman"" is also at the Brooklyn Paramount.

The photography is good and Mr. Johnson's running comment on the scenes adds to the interest. Apparently the denizens of the Congo wilds are getting accustomed to human visitors, as they seem to have submitted to being put into the picture without any great resentment. Mrs. Johnson remarked in her introduction that this film was made without bloodshed. Especially interesting are the scenes of life among the pygmies, those happy little folk who according to Mr. Johnson, fear no devils nor gods and live in the present without worrying about the past or future. As it would have been almost impossible to invade their forest without frightening them away, several hundred pygmies were induced to come to the Johnsons' camp and spend several weeks there About the only attempt at injecting a ""story"" into the film is an episode resulting in a marriage among the small people.

The dead man wears tennis shoes and stands on his head, covered with branches and disguised as a Christmas tree. ""Mixed Nuts,"" Nora Ephron's frenetic comedy about a suicide hot line in Venice, Calif., is about as funny as that corpse, and about as natural. Adapted from the French film ""Le Pere Noel Est une Ordure,"" it has a farcical tone that loses everything in translation, with only hand-waving, door-slamming and zany costumes left behind. A title song incorporating the names of nut varieties is only one of the film's desperate ploys. Ms. Ephron is generally so much funnier than this that ""Mixed Nuts"" leaves a mystifying impression. Not even its screenplay, which she adapted with her sister Delia Ephron, shows much comic style. The film's modus operandi is unleashing a horde of not-so-cute eccentrics in a confined setting and encouraging them all to talk, fuss and gesticulate at the same time. This leads to a scene with five people crammed noisily into the same bathroom, four of them oblivious and the fifth using the toilet. The revelers here include Steve Martin as a lonely-guy suicide prevention worker along with Rita Wilson, a nervous wallflower type who has to go sit in the bathtub, fully clothed, whenever life becomes overwhelming. Madeline Kahn plays their boss as a variation on her character in ""The Sisters Rosensweig,"" which would be fine if the film were less hysterical and didn't require her to become wackily unstrung. Juliette Lewis, as a pregnant shop owner with a husband dressed as Santa Claus, is as funny as this comedy gets, which is a meaningful measure. If you can't guess whether she will go into labor at the height of the story's New Year's Eve frenzy, you haven't been paying attention. Staged as pure fluff without an ounce of ballast, ""Mixed Nuts"" succeeds only in getting its cast into Halloween-caliber crazy costumes by the time it's over. There is also a soundtrack full of pop Christmas songs, which don't do for this film what Jimmy Durante did for Ms. Ephron's ""Sleepless in Seattle.""The cast (including Rob Reiner, Robert Klein, Anthony LaPaglia and Liev Shreiber as a very large transvestite) inspires good will whenever possible. But in the case of Adam Sandler, it's out of the question. Mr. Sandler dresses as a gondolier, plays the ukulele and sings stupid little nonsense songs in an irritating falsetto. If you didn't know this was part of his established shtick on ""Saturday Night Live,"" you might think ""Mixed Nuts"" was simply crazy.""Mixed Nuts"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity, sexual references and jokey violence.

"FILM REVIEW: MILK MONEY; A Hooker Who Yearns For the Simple Life, And Finds a Simpleton - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from August 31, 1994, Section C, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. For 10 sniggery minutes, ""Milk Money"" actually has something to do with pre-adolescent sexuality. It tells what happens when three sex-obsessed junior high school boys pool their money to raise $100, which they plan to pay some woman -- any woman -- for taking off her clothes. In search of a candidate, they bicycle from their suburb to a nearby city, their faces flushed with the thrill of adventure. Richard Benjamin, laboring under the idea that this is an enchanting premise, directs such episodes as if he were Norman Rockwell in a trenchcoat. Let's not sprain anything, although the screenwriter (John Mattson) may have, explaining how the boys happen to meet V (Melanie Griffith). She's a prostitute who happens to need $100 in the worst way. So V is easily persuaded to display brief, partial nudity, which is not shown on camera. What the audience does see is wide-eyed little Frank (Michael Patrick Carter) chomping corn chips as V, whose back is to the audience, prepares to drop the top of her dress. Frank finally doesn't look, and he doesn't have to. As it turns out, the movie's naughtiness was only a plot device to throw Frank and V together. It is gone right after this.""Milk Money"" may be the first brainless American comedy that deserves to be remade by the French, if only because Gallic sophistication about sex would be so much more welcome than Hollywood coyness. After all, there comes a point in this story where Frank tells V, ""And don't take your clothes off for money!""What makes Frank turn puritan? The fact that he decides V would make a good wife for his widowed dad (Ed Harris). Accordingly, he tells his father that V is a math tutor, which leads Dad into unwitting double-entendres like: ""Frank was telling me what you do. Do you enjoy it?"" Or: ""I would teach him"" -- Frank -- ""myself, but I'm way out of practice.""V, who shortened her name from Eve ""because it sounded too biblical,"" is a movie prostitute. This is not the same thing as a woman who actually takes money for sexual favors. V is seen with only a single client, and the closest she comes to having sex with him is sitting in the back of his car, feeding him chocolate-dipped strawberries and calling him ""Big Boy."" Instead, she's a dreamer, the sort who secretly yearns for a simpler life and enjoys being told she resembles Grace Kelly. The movie actually manages to lob Kelly-related compliments at V on a regular basis. As V begins cleaning up her act, she begins dressing up in the flowered frocks that belonged to Frank's mother, charming Dad and leaving her past behind. What past? This film is so darned open-minded that Frank is able to deliver this homily: ""Dad, you always say it's not what you do, it's who you are.""The film may try to renounce its own tawdriness, but not Ms. Griffith; she brings a certain irrepressible gusto to her role. Among the few genuinely amusing scenes here are those that show her flouncing through the small town where Frank and Dad live, scandalizing the locals and even finding one ex-client strolling with his wife on Main Street. Like any good movie prostitute, she wears precisely the right costume for such occasions. It's skimpy but not truly cheap, and it's hot enough to excite the fashion sense of local pre-teen girls. ""Milk Money"" seems to think a stray hooker would fascinate and charm them, even when she's used by a proud Frank as an exhibit in biology class. Mr. Harris manages to be improbably charming, despite the fact that his character, an amateur ecologist, is presented as one of the dimmest creatures ever to crawl out of the tide pool. This film's ending, which allows V to indulge her own heretofore-unknown ecological interests, deserves comparison with the last moments of ""Indecent Proposal,"" a much more entertaining neo-prostitution tale. Philanthropy in such stories is a favorite way of encouraging viewers to forget what they're really about.""Milk Money"" is rated PG-13 (""Parents strongly cautioned""). It includes brief, partial nudity and sexual suggestiveness. MILK MONEYDirected by Richard Benjamin; written by John Mattson; director of photography, David Watkin; edited by Jacqueline Cambas; music by Michael Convertino; production designer, Paul Sylbert; produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall; released by Paramount Pictures.

FILM REVIEW; A Champion of Fidelity In a Family of Affairs - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from January 27, 1995, Section C, Page 6Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The serious comedies of Woody Allen have inspired a number of entertaining homages, but none that matches ""Miami Rhapsody"" in thoughtfulness and emotional realism. The first feature to be written and directed by David Frankel, a 35-year-old film maker from New York City with a background in television, the movie might be described as ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" with a ""Thirtysomething"" point of view. In its matter-of-fact view of adultery in post-sexual revolutionary times, it feels utterly contemporary in a way that Mr. Allen's movies do not. From its opening credits, in which Louis Armstrong growls a jaunty ""Just One of Those Things"" behind glowing Art Deco titles, ""Miami Rhapsody"" proudly flaunts its reverence for Mr. Allen's style. Those touches, however, are the movie's only nostalgic elements. The film's funniest joke and most blatant tribute is the casting of Mia Farrow in the role of Nina Marcus, a married upper-middle-class woman of around 50 who has a brief affair with a younger man. The movie, set in present-day Miami, examines the romantic peccadilloes of a well-heeled Jewish family through the eyes of Gwyn Marcus (Sarah Jessica Parker), the second of the three grownup children of Nina and her husband, Vic (Paul Mazursky). In the opening scene, Gwyn, a frizzy-haired, wisecracking advertising copywriter, is shown confiding her anxieties about emotional commitment and marriage to an unseen doctor. Most of the rest of the film consists of scenes of marital discord and extramarital dalliance among the members of Gwyn's own family. The fissures in relationships she had assumed were monogamous have prompted her to break off her engagement to Matt (Gil Bellows), a serene, handsome young zoologist who seems almost too good to be true. Gwyn's fantasy that marriage within her comfortable social stratum is synonymous with sexual fidelity is shattered when her mother confesses to having an affair with Antonio (Antonio Banderas), a Cuban exile and male nurse who has been attending Gwyn's invalid grandmother. A Holocaust survivor rendered speechless from a stroke, the old woman is the movie's silent moral grounding wire. Gwyn's father is also shown to be no saint. A flashback reveals his affair with his raucous travel agent Zelda (Kelly Bishop). And the recent marriages of Gwyn's two siblings aren't faring any better. The sexual spark has gone out of the relationship between her older brother, Jordan (Kevin Pollak), and his pregnant wife, Terri (Barbara Garrick). Jordan has a brief affair with Kala (Naomi Campbell), a model who is the wife of his business partner. The marriage of Gwyn's spoiled younger sister, Leslie (Carla Gugino), to Jeff (Bo Eason), a tight-fisted football player for the Miami Dolphins, is in trouble right from the start. Leslie, who was boy crazy in high school, still has a wandering eye. And Jeff obsesses morosely about his professional and financial future. As it jumps breezily from one character to another, ""Miami Rhapsody"" displays the light-hearted narrative rhythm of a Woody Allen film. But unlike Mr. Allen's films, it doesn't go for the comic or emotional jugular. The prospect of the grandmother's death doesn't prompt any darkly funny musings on mortality, evil and the absurdity of existence. What impresses Gwyn the most is how her grandmother survived the physical privations of the Holocaust with her good humor intact. Although Gwyn serves as the film's Allen-like comic commentator, her funnier observations are the sort of barbed remarks found in a smart sitcom. There are no highbrow references to treasured works of literature. The cultural totems at which Mr. Allen clutches with the ardency of a precocious schoolboy fighting off his angst are taken for granted in the world of ""Miami Rhapsody."" Gwyn has no aspirations to be Chekhov or even Woody Allen. Her dream is to make the leap from advertising copywriter to fulltime comedy writer for television. What is most disturbing about the Marcus siblings is their ferocious and unexamined sense of entitlement. Their main preoccupations are career, love life and physical well being. Without overtly condemning them, the movie portrays the Marcus siblings as whiningly self-absorbed representatives of their generation and class. Of the three, Gwyn, whose saving grace is her sense of humor, is by far the most likable. The director has inherited Mr. Allen's superb command of ensemble film acting, and the movie's smooth, psychologically rich performances cohere in a way that makes the Marcuses seem like a real family. Ms. Parker's Gwyn may be engagingly chatty, but she is not instantly lovable. Mr. Pollack and Ms. Gugino bring bracingly sharp edges to Gwyn's unapologetically selfish brother and sister. The happiest character is Mr. Banderas's Antonio. While his role is that of a sensual Latin American who lives for the moment, his performance has a joy and snap that transcends the stereotype. The presence of Mr. Mazursky, who plays Vic with a big-hearted gusto, is a reminder that in exploring marriage and its discontents, ""Miami Rhapsody"" has a notable antecedent in Mr. Mazursky's own 1969 movie, ""Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice."" That film, steeped in the sensibility of the human potential movement, posed with hand-wringing intensity the question: to swing or not to swing. In the world of ""Miami Rhapsody,"" infidelity is still a big deal, but not as earthshaking as it once was. The Marcuses -- most of them, at least -- have the strength to forgive, forget and move on. Gwyn, a thoroughly 90's woman, doesn't have to choose between marriage and career. She can have either or both. But like almost everybody else in ""Miami Rhapsody,"" she doesn't begin to realize how lucky she is.""Miami Rhapsody"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations and brief nudity.

"‘Fighting With My Family’ Review: They Body Slam You, Your Mum and Dad. Lovingly. - The New York Times","cue the cheering crowd. “Fighting With My Family” isn’t much different, which is extremely and shrewdly on point for a movie about professional wrestlers with bigger-than-life personalities and flamboyant stage names who, in a circumscribed space, deliver precisely coordinated, rule-bound narratives of victory, agony and defeat. Like genre cinema, professional wrestling strikes a balance between convention and innovation, between what the crowd knows (expects) and the surprises, the little deviations from the usual script, that can drive it to its feet. Much of the movie turns on a sibling rivalry that upends and nearly rends the family when Paige, selected at an audition for World Wrestling Entertainment, is shipped off to a Florida boot camp. (W. W. E. Studios helped make the movie.) While Paige — a Goth girl with a heavy curtain of jet-black hair — struggles to fit into the competition, where the tanned and the blond rule, often in bikinis, Zak licks his wounds at home, trying and generally failing to deal with disappointment. As Merchant toggles between Zak in Norwich and Paige in Florida, he settles into a familiar struggle between authenticity and artificiality, a seemingly odd divide on which to hang a tale of professional wrestlers. If it works, it’s partly because of the easy allure of authenticity narratives, even the most contrived. Paige considers the other female competitors suspiciously, unwittingly condescending to them because she doesn’t view them as real wrestlers. For Paige, her authenticity is a given, even if her professional persona — which changes along with her wrestling name — is a construct. Merchant gently plays with this idea, mostly to fill in the story as she progresses from obliviousness to self-knowledge and the inevitable third-act clinch. (The genesis of the movie is an entertaining, more open-ended Channel 4 television documentary about the Knights, “The Wrestlers: Fighting With My Family.”)Merchant is probably best known for the original British version of “The Office,” which he helped create. He doesn’t do much with the camera in “Fighting With My Family,” which has a filmmaking style that’s best described as functional. But he has a terrific cast (including Vince Vaughn as a coach), pinpoint timing and a gift for visual japes and physical comedy, for arranging bodies in funny formations and for underlining everyday absurdity. Merchant also has a sense of flow. Even when the jokes are as blunt as the bowling ball that Ricky delivers to another wrestler’s groin — they’re testing out a dubious routine — they just slide into the story, becoming part of its textured realismLike its amiable, irresistible ménage, “Fighting With My Family” softens its rougher edges with humor. It’s often broadly funny but never mean or patronizing; it takes the Knights, their eccentricities and quixotic aspirations seriously, but not enough to squelch the fun. At times, particularly when the family is in its element at its gym (a.k.a. World Association of Wrestling, a.k.a. W. A. W.), which does double-time as a refuge for young neighborhood strays, the movie evokes the working-class milieu familiar from British filmmakers like Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. Merchant doesn’t seem keen to score political points, but he nevertheless quietly delivers some truths amid the laughter and hurt.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/movies/fighting-with-my-family-review.html

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""Murder in the First"" is the semi-true story of Henri Young, who in March 1938 was placed in solitary confinement in an underground vault at Alcatraz and remained thus cruelly confined for more than three years. Released into the prison population and suffering the mind-altering effects of his ordeal, he killed a man he thought had wronged him. Was Henri Young responsible for his own actions after suffering such duress? Was he murderer or victim?The conventions of courtroom drama provide an easy answer to that question, just as they provide James Stamphill (Christian Slater), the idealistic young lawyer who takes the case of Henri Young (Kevin Bacon). Stamphill, a composite of the lawyers who defended Young, is kind, brash and fresh out of Harvard Law School. He's principled. He admires Clarence Darrow. This case means a lot to him. He treats his client with great compassion. It's essential, in this sort of storytelling, that both Stamphill and Young become better individuals because they work together toward a just cause.""Where the Day Takes You,"" Marc Rocco's earlier film about homeless teen-agers in Los Angeles, took place on a smaller scale and much less familiar territory than ""Murder in the First."" This time, while Mr. Rocco again tells a story confidently and elicits sturdy performances from his actors, he falls into a directorial trap or two. Striving for a more grandiose tone, he loads on inspirational music and indulges in enough mobile camerawork to make the head spin. None of this really disguises the fact that this courtroom drama unfolds in expected ways.""Murder in the First"" stakes its claim to toughness with a grueling first half hour, which details Young's suffering in solitary confinement and at the hands of a sadistic warden (Gary Oldman, working menacingly in his American mode). Mr. Bacon tries mightily to capture Young's physical nightmare, and he makes these sequences convincing. But he can't dispel the thought that the film lacks some essential grit. Later on, his Young emerges from the hole broken in body and spirit: scarred, hobbled, cowering and displaying the kinds of actorish disabilities sure to rivet an audience's attention. Like Jodie Foster in ""Nell,"" Mr. Bacon does these things convincingly in a film that doesn't offer a credible context for its main characters. Too often, with the camera prowling restlessly as Stamphill draws Young out of his catatonia, the actors bring passionate conviction to material that seems pat. Surprise is so lacking that Stamphill's opening remarks about his client in the courtroom correspond with what Young says later, when he finally blurts out an impassioned statement about himself. In the courtroom, while the Steadicam ricochets around the set as if it were a pinball machine, Mr. Rocco has assembled a solid team of performers. Mr. Slater, with his hair combed like Ronald Reagan's, paces the set energetically; William H. Macy makes a sardonic prosecutor, and R. Lee Ermey a stern judge. Also in the cast are Embeth Davidtz (of ""Schindler's List"") and Kyra Sedgwick, as women who only bring out Young's pitiable impotence and humiliation, and Brad Dourif as Stamphill's prosperous and cynical older brother. The supporting performers are effective, especially Mr. Dourif and Mr. Oldman. But nothing in the film eclipses Mr. Bacon's intense, tragic performance in the story's pivotal role. Mr. Rocco lets the film's ending drag on in search of an inspirational note, which proves elusive. A movie marquee glimpsed during the story shows a Frank Capra title, redolent of a crusading clarity that ""Murder in the First"" never achieves.""Murder in the First"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, sadistic violence and discreet sexual situations.

Review: Tyler Perry Turns Tiffany Haddish Loose in ‘Nobody’s Fool’ - The New York Times,"Tyler Perry’s instincts as an entertainer are always sharp. Letting the comedic dynamo Tiffany Haddish have her way with his new romantic comedy-drama “Nobody’s Fool” is a typically savvy move. Haddish worked with Perry on his television series “If Loving You Is Wrong.” Here, in this R-rated movie (a rarity for Perry), Haddish riffs and mugs with much less inhibition. As Tanya, the ex-con sister of Tika Sumpter’s successful, love-starved ad executive Danica, Haddish motormouths sentiments unsparingly and hilariously profane, garnished with deliberately squirmy sexual metaphors. But even allowing for Haddish’s hilarious digressions, “Nobody’s Fool” is a baggy movie. In the first 50 minutes, it saunters through about 30 minutes’ worth of plot. Danica is in an online relationship that Tanya finds so suspicious that she ropes in the real-life creators of the series “Catfish: The TV Show.” In the meantime, a sweet, sensitive coffee shop owner named Frank (Omari Hardwick) pines for Danica, while helping Tanya with employment and addiction recovery. Frank, alas, doesn’t have the qualities on Danica’s list for an ideal man; once she finds out he is an ex-con, she’s even less interested. Until their first kiss. If the movie’s looseness lets in an excess of dead air, “Nobody’s Fool” is still dotted with pleasures besides those Haddish brings. Chris Rock has a funny cameo in which he goes near-full Redd Foxx, while Mehcad Brooks enlivens the last quarter as a dream guy who turns out to be very much less than that. Whoopi Goldberg, as the sisters’ pot-growing mom, contributes some funny stoner humor. Nonjudgmental stoner humor, at that. This is the first Perry movie I’ve seen to eschew strident moralizing, and it is all the better for that.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/movies/nobodys-fool-review-tyler-perry-tiffany-haddish.html
FILM REVIEW; Paul Newman in Blue-Collar Gear - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from December 23, 1994, Section C, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. You hear Paul Newman before you see him in ""Nobody's Fool,"" yelling affectionately to Jessica Tandy as his landlady, Miss Beryl. With the raspiness his voice has taken on recently and the irreverence that has always been part of his charm, he shouts: ""Still alive in there, old lady? Didn't die in your sleep, did you?"" Then he sits in her living room chair to put on his work boots, which isn't easy. He has a bad knee that is getting worse and an occasional off-the-books job working construction for Carl Roebuck (Bruce Willis), who owes him money. He lives alone in the apartment above Miss Beryl's, and at 60 he is running out of time for his life to turn out all right. It says everything about Mr. Newman's performance, the single best of this year and among the finest he has ever given, that you never stop to wonder how a guy as good-looking as Paul Newman ended up this way. As Donald Sullivan, called Sully by everyone except Miss Beryl, Mr. Newman does look good, even with a limp and muddy work clothes. But he plays Sully from the inside out. Though the character's humor carries traces of earlier Newman heroes, the effect is as natural as if Sully had watched Butch Cassidy or Cool Hand Luke and decided on a strategy: take life as it comes and face it down with a wisecrack. Mr. Newman's approach -- without cheap sentiment or self-pity -- is matched by the film itself, exquisitely directed by Robert Benton and adapted by him from Richard Russo's novel. On screen as in the book, ""Nobody's Fool"" has the rich texture of a 19th-century novel, as if Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair"" were transported to the blue-collar town of North Bath in upstate New York. Instead of glamour, Bath has the Iron Horse, the local bar where Sully and his perpetually losing lawyer (Gene Saks) bet on the outcome of the People's Court on television. There are tenement houses behind chain-link fences and a banner across Main Street that promotes the town as the future home of the Ultimate Escape Theme Park. Bath is the kind of place people usually try to escape, but ""Nobody's Fool"" is the nearly plotless story of those who stay. In a series of lifelike small encounters, some comic and some deeply emotional, Sully discovers how many people count on him. They include his friend and co-worker Rub Squeers (Pruitt Taylor Vince), who has far more loyalty than intelligence. There is Miss Beryl, who doesn't have much use for her son, Clive (Josef Sommer), the local banker. ""He isn't my son; they switched bassinets at the hospital,"" she says tartly at Thanksgiving dinner with his business associates. In one of her last performances, Ms. Tandy is perfection, spry without being cute. Sully flirts with Carl's wife, Toby (Melanie Griffith), who knows her husband is messing around with his secretary but can't seem to kick him out for good. She is a woman whose beauty is almost ready to fade, and her relationship with Sully has the ease and electricity of an attraction bound to go nowhere. Throughout the film, Sully's past unfolds gracefully, as the pieces fall into his line of vision. An important part of the past literally drives into view while Sully is hitchhiking, and his son, Peter (Dylan Walsh), stops on the road. Peter has just been fired from his job as a college English teacher in West Virginia, and has driven with his wife and two small sons to spend Thanksgiving with Sully's ex-wife, the fastidious Vera (Elizabeth Wilson). Peter is the one character let down by the screenplay. Every word he says seems to express anger at the way Sully abandoned the family when Peter was a baby. His dialogue goes beyond what an injured son might say, and lands in the area of clumsy exposition, even in a comic scene in which Peter helps his father knock out a Doberman and steal a snowblower. The theme of redeeming yourself in someone's love works better and with greater subtlety in Sully's scenes with his grandson, Will (Alexander Goodwin). ""Want to drive?"" Sully asks the boy, putting him on his lap as they drive his old red pickup truck and revealing the easy charm that has made Sully a survivor. A lesser problem is the feeling that something is slightly off in Sully's relationship with Toby. In fact, the film has cut out the character who balanced her in the novel, a married woman named Ruth with whom Sully has had a long on-and-off affair. Ruth's absence plagues the film like a phantom limb, making Sully more isolated, stranding him without a sex life and perhaps making him more acceptable to mainstream movie audiences. But these are slight flaws in a film in which almost everything works. John Bailey photographs Bath with brisk, natural clarity. Mr. Willis uses smarminess to good effect, and Mr. Vince and Mr. Saks create two different but equally touching small-town failures.""Nobody's Fool"" opens on Christmas Day. In its elegiac final scene, Ms. Tandy walks toward her kitchen to make tea, still lively and clear-headed. Sully is asleep in her chair, physically back where he started but emotionally several leaps ahead. If ""Nobody's Fool"" is often heartbreaking in its sense of loss, it is also hopeful in the strength of its emotions and the sheer beauty of its performances.""Nobody's Fool"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some nudity.

Among other things, Cassie wears squashy, old-fashioned hats of the sort that Marie Dressler wore in ''Anna Christie.''Cassie has also had the bad judgment to let everybody know how much she's suffering over her unhappy affair with Billy, the small-town Romeo who has left her in the lurch. When Cassie told Billy that she was pregnant, his passion vanished. ''This is no reflection on you,'' he said earnestly, ''but I'm not ready to cash in my chips. Don't worry. I'll split all the costs right down the line - 50-50.''''Nobody's Fool'' opens today at Loews New York Twin and other theaters. Miss Henley, whose ''Crimes of the Heart'' won the Pulitzer Prize, has a special gift for details that are oddball and/or grotesque. ''Nobody's Fool,'' based on an early, pre-''Crimes of the Heart'' screenplay, has a number of such inspirations, including a formal, small-town wedding featuring an albino bride (''They say she can't see a thing with those pink little eyes. She has to count her way down the aisle - 24 steps'') and a first cousin who, in a moment of despair, baked the family cat in the oven. There are also an aunt who proudly shows off her ''maintenance-free'' (gravel) yard, and Cassie's late father, who, according to Cassie, was killed by his silk socks. There's a comic mind at work here. However, in ''Nobody's Fool,'' these details look like topiary in an otherwise vacant lot. At the heart of the film is the dreary romance of Cassie and a Buckeye Basin transient, Riley (Eric Roberts), the hot-headed lighting designer at the local summer theater. I've no idea whether it's because of the performances of Miss Arquette and Mr. Roberts (who never seem to connect), the writing or the direction (by Evelyn Purcell), but this key relationship is utterly charmless. Everything that's good about ''Nobody's Fool'' is either subsidiary to the central situation or superfluous. Falling into this category are Louise Fletcher, who plays Cassie's mother; Mare Winningham, as Cassie's best friend; Jim Youngs, as the faithless Billy, and Stephen Tobolowsky, who gives the film's funniest performance as a second-rate man of the theater.''Nobody's Fool,'' which has been rated PG-13 (''Special Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13''), includes some discreetly sexual scenes and vulgar language.

At the Albee - The New York Times,"not to mention its audience. Put together with apparently more speed than inspiration, the film narrates the oft told story of a country yokel who comes to Manhattan and outsmarts a gang of real estate racketeers intent on defrauding a nice old lady of three feet of property in Fifty-third Street. That's the gist of ""Nobody's Fool,"" which would probably make a compact three-reeler. But then, ""Show Boat"" is enough to justify a visit to the Albee.

‘Martin Eden’ Review: Reading and Writing His Way Out of the Pit - The New York Times,"its promises, illusions and traumas — sweeps through the audacious and thrilling “Martin Eden.” An ingenious adaptation of the Jack London novel, the film follows its title character, a humble young man as he embarks on a program of self-improvement. Like a hero out of Horatio Alger, Martin strives to change and to advance. A voracious autodidact, he succeeds. But his rags-to-rich path with its hard work, perseverance and bourgeois education, proves far more complicated and finally more shattering than most upward-mobility fairy tales. The story proper opens when Martin (a revelatory Luca Marinelli), a sailor, is still rough clay. He’s a beautiful and raw masculine specimen, with a loose gait, an ominous scar under one eye and a nose that sits on his sculptured face like the prow of a ship. When he’s not at sea, he lives with his sister and her family in a cheerless, suffocating house. On land, Martin seems penned in, but everything about him — his restless body, jutting chin, quick fists — suggests he’s eager to break free. His opportunity comes when he rescues the son of a wealthy family from a thug. Invited to the family’s mansion, Martin is at once awed and seduced by its opulence; he hungrily studies an oil painting and leafs through a volume of Baudelaire. He also falls under the spell of the daughter, Elena (Jessica Cressy), who becomes interchangeable with her world. A wan, pretty avatar of the upper classes, Elena is physically droopy and given to dull pronouncements; she’s educated just enough to think she knows better. She’s been groomed for acquiescence, which makes Martin’s wildness intriguing to her. More important, Elena ignites something in Martin — call it desire — that spurs him to transform into a man he thinks will be worthy of her. The Italian director Pietro Marcello takes an inventive, excitingly irreverent approach to London’s novel, which was published in 1909 to great critical censure. The book is a stunning heartbreaker, and Marcello — who transports this very American story to Italy — follows its sweep as he lingers on some of the milestones in Martin’s transformational journey, his new friends and philosophies. The true miracle of this film is how Marcello translates both London’s scabrous tone and his lush, character-revealing prose into pure cinema. Lines have been plucked from the novel, yet even at its wordiest, the film is never weighed down by the burden of faithfulness. Marcello’s boldest conceptual move is to blur the story’s historical timeline, which he does through brilliant editing, a strategic use of archival footage and playing with the usual period cues. Cars change and the lengths of women’s skirts shift, unsettling your sense of time. Soon after the film opens but before the young Martin is introduced, Marcello folds in silent-era newsreel images from 1920 of the anarchist and revolutionary Errico Malatesta amid an eager throng. The archival imagery suggests the story’s time frame and nods at the larger historical forces at work as Martin rejects socialism to embrace an annihilating individualism. These forces swirl and churn, ebbing and flowing as Martin continues on his quest for self-improvement. He studies and he learns, insatiably reading everything. Each exotic word and ravished book serves to close the gap between him and Elena, or so he believes. What he doesn’t grasp is that all his knowledge — with its dizzying new words and implanted thoughts — only increases the distance between them. That’s particularly true when Martin turns to writing. He buys a typewriter and pounds out stories that he fails to sell until he does, thereby rewriting his fate. Touching and vaguely menacing, Martin looms like a colossus. He’s such an overwhelming presence that it’s a shock whenever he and Elena stand face to face and you remember he isn’t a giant. Marcello lightly accentuates Martin’s size using camera angles and other strategies: Martin is hovering over Elena when he announces he’s going to write. For the most part, though, his bigger-than-lifeness comes from his feverish words (“I felt a creative spirit burning inside”) and from a performance that can make it seem as if Martin were straining at the seams of his very being. His eyes bulge, his shoulders brace. He grows, he transforms, and then he invokes Nietzsche. “Martin Eden” is an autobiographical artist’s novel — “I was Martin Eden,” London later wrote — and a didactic one. London was disappointed that critics didn’t understand the indictment of individualism he advanced through Martin, whose existential condition incorporates philosophical arguments of the day. By transferring the story to the period between the two World Wars, however hazily, Marcello extends those arguments deeper into the century, sometimes to unnerving effect. Late in the story, after Martin’s great and terrible success, he is toasted by a man whose bald head and loving talk of war suggest Mussolini in a scene that could have taken place yesterday. By connecting the triumph of one man’s individual will to fascism, Marcello turns Martin into a time traveler. This Martin is an emissary from the past and a warning for the present. For a time, he is also a hugely attractive, magnetic figure whose power Marcello builds only to coolly dismantle. (Few filmmakers do as much with jump cuts as he does here.) It’s easy to fall under Martin’s spell, to gaze at him like Elena finally does. The genius of “Martin Eden” is that Marcello makes you fall in love with Martin only to reveal — as the hero’s journey devolves into a devastating tragedy — how easily we are charmed by the charismatic man who has absolutely nothing to offer.

"‘Antebellum’ Review: Look Away, Dixie Land - The New York Times","an extended bit of cinematic bravura that takes in the pageantry and cruelty of a Louisiana plantation — seems to locate the action in the midst of the Civil War. Confederate officers circulate among the belles and the enslaved workers; later there will be some boasting about impending victory over the treacherous “blue-bellied” enemy. So maybe “Antebellum” refers not to the Civil War that already happened, but to one that may be on its way. A chilling thought, for sure, and one that a horror movie might help us think. In the wake of “Get Out,” there is still plenty of scariness and satire to be extracted from the toxic matter of American racism, and there is great potential in a movie that connects the microaggressions of the present with the brutality of the past. “Antebellum” is emphatically not that movie. Written and directed by Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz, and propelled by the charisma of Janelle Monáe, it lines up moments of possible insight and impact and messes up just about all of them. That opening shot, for example, is a demonstration of impressive filmmaking skill tethered to a dubious cause, a sign that what follows will be slick, aggressive and muddle-headed. The camera glides through the grounds, disclosing decorum in the front and brutality in the back. Would-be runaways, including Monáe’s Eden, are subjected to savage punishment, a tableau of torture and murder that doesn’t so much depict dehumanization as participate in it. The Black characters, Eden partly excepted, are mostly nameless and voiceless, forbidden by their masters from speaking to one another. Instead of singing while they work, they are ordered to whistle. The cotton they spend the day picking is burned when the work is done, a clue that the setting may not be the Old South we’re accustomed to seeing onscreen. This is a place where Black suffering isn’t the byproduct of economic arrangements, but rather an organizing principle in its own right. The rapes, beatings, brandings and killings we witness are happening for fun. And not only the fun of the designated villains, who include a Confederate commander (Eric Lange) and a hoop-skirted plantation mistress (Jena Malone). “Antebellum” operates according to the well-established logic of exploitation. The horrors in the first part are there to justify bloody acts of vengeance later on. But the transaction also works in reverse: The certainty of eventual revenge excuses the audience’s voyeuristic excitement at the nasty business that comes first. If you want to preserve the movie’s surprise — not a very well-guarded secret in any case — you can stop reading now. What perhaps is not surprising is how “Antebellum” presents the lurid spectacle of a woman’s humiliation as if it were a fable of empowerment. Eden, it turns out, is really Veronica Henley, a best-selling author with a Ph. D. in sociology and a life of 21st-century professional and domestic near-perfection. In between speaking engagements, triumphant television appearances and private yoga sessions, Veronica cocoons with her sexy, devoted husband (Marque Richardson) and their adorable young daughter. On a work trip to New Orleans, she treats herself to a night out with her two best girlfriends (Lily Cowles and Gabourey Sidibe, who supplies nearly all of the fun the movie has to offer). There are some hiccups and annoyances in Veronica’s mostly charmed life, but she knows how to deal with rude hotel concierges and other obnoxious white people. Her work is full of can-do optimism and abstract buzzwords, painting a future of long-overdue individual and collective victory for Black women like her. The middle section of “Antebellum,” which is a flashback to the hours leading up to Veronica’s kidnapping and enslavement, portrays her happiness as superficially as the rest of the film presents her degradation. She’s less a person than a signifier — an image of idealized success put on display for the purpose of being trashed. Who would want to do such a thing? The answer “Antebellum” provides is as shallow as anything else: a bunch of evil racists is who, though the particulars of their methods and motives are left vague. That’s because the real beneficiaries of Veronica’s victimization are the filmmakers themselves, who seem to have reached for easy political relevance without grasping the political implications of what they were doing.

‘Seahorse: The Dad Who Gave Birth’ Review: When He’s Expecting - The New York Times,"Shortly before turning 30, Freddy McConnell, a freelance journalist who has worked at The Guardian, made the decision to bear a child. In “Seahorse: The Dad Who Gave Birth,” McConnell, who is transgender, explains that he saw the decision to carry the pregnancy himself as “the pragmatic thing to do.” Perhaps less obviously pragmatic is undergoing that experience under the observation of a movie crew. With his newspaper involved in the production, McConnell invited the filmmaker Jeanie Finlay to follow him through the process. (Finlay is currently the subject of a Museum of the Moving Image retrospective that will play virtually through July 2.) He told the paper that he felt a responsibility to share the story. What Finlay absorbingly captures is far more than an ordinary pregnancy. She is present as the prospect of parenthood alters the dynamic between McConnell and his partner, C. J., who initially wants to co-parent with him. (“We’re discovering that we were quite different and didn’t know each other that well,” McConnell explains after C. J. decides not to be involved. In the sort of moment that suggests a potentially intriguing interplay between director and subject, he asks if Finlay has seen C. J. since the separation.)McConnell has a strained relationship with his father and relays news of the pregnancy to him by email, writing that he’s afraid of how he would react in person. Most crucially, Finlay trails McConnell as the pregnancy alters his sense of who he is, ushering in what he describes as a “total loss of myself.” After the cessation of testosterone treatments starts changing his body, he finds that he reverts to old, more concealing ways of dressing. Even before a pregnancy is confirmed, he begins thinking more of his previous name and pronouns. Keeping notes on his pregnancy on standard forms, he crosses out “women,” “mothers,” “her” and “she,” an inscribing experience that he says feels “pretty brutal.” McConnell confesses that even well-meaning cisgender mothers who have shared recollections of pregnancy have made him want to say, “No, it’s not the same.”“Seahorse” is the sort of documentary that gains its interest less from its technique than from its subject, and from the fact that the filmmaker was present at the right time. Articulate, reflective and unhesitant about getting personal, McConnell makes for a complicated character study. Although he gave birth to a son in 2018, his story is hardly over, and extends beyond the timeline in the film. In April, The New York Times reported that McConnell lost an appeal to be registered as the boy’s father, not mother. On April 29, he wrote that he was applying to take the case to Britain’s highest court. Seahorse: The Dad Who Gave BirthNot rated. Running time: 1 hour 31 minutes.

"‘Artemis Fowl’ Review: Fowl, Not Fair - The New York Times","lately his taste runs to Agatha Christie — on a bad day, he goes mercenary, stewarding properties like “Thor,” Jack Ryan and now “Artemis Fowl” (streaming on Disney Plus). The latest movie, based on a novel in the young-adult series by Eoin Colfer, projects absolutely nothing beyond a desire to kick-start a new hotshot franchise: Coming soon! Seven sequels. Insert original here. “Artemis Fowl” stockpiles ingredients from successful series of yore, whether “Star Wars” (a robed villain with a technologically tweaked croak), Harry Potter (the dwarf played by Josh Gad surely shares a barber with Robbie Coltrane’s Hagrid) or “Lord of the Rings” (the commotion of sprites and goblins). Even the suits-and-shades aesthetic of “Men in Black” finds a place. Somewhere in this overstuffed grab bag is the title character (Ferdia Shaw), a 12-year-old boy genius and — by the end — professed criminal mastermind. In the hubbub, he gets precious few opportunities to show off his masterminding. The screenplay, by the Irish playwright Conor McPherson (“The Seafarer”) and Hamish McColl, sets up Artemis as a character who theoretically is always a few steps ahead of the audience: a child so smart he can beat a chess champion in five moves or clone a goat. An introductory scene finds Artemis matching wits with a therapist and quickly besting his knowledge of antiques. He points out that a chair that appears to be three centuries old shows evidence of industrial tooling. But after the boy’s father, the elder Artemis Fowl (Colin Farrell), disappears, the protagonist and his bodyguard (Nonso Anozie) are reduced to following clues that themselves progress in a machine-tooled fashion. Or maybe Artemis is simply so smart that he can’t waste time allowing the audience to share in the fun of solving mysteries. Every clue leads directly to another clue; each expository nugget pays off with clockwork precision. Fowl Sr.’s disappearance relates to his knowledge that Earth’s core is filled with fairies, centaurs and other fantasy creatures. (A joke suggests that David Bowie was one of them, living among us.) After the debacle of “Cats,” Judi Dench can surely count her performance as the boss of a special-forces outfit called LEPrecon as a significant downgrade in embarrassment, even if the role does compel her to bark “top of the mornin’” upon arriving in Ireland as if it were a Schwarzenegger catchphrase. The other significant players are Holly (Lara McDonnell), an officer with a tendency to disobey the Dench character’s orders, and Gad’s dwarf, who is large for his species. His function is to narrate the tale and to signal his superiority to the material with an occasional reference to 1980s pop music or a diet fad. (Of why humans should be kept ignorant of the world underground, he says, “Most human beings are afraid of gluten.”)Although Branagh serves up an occasional inspired image (a troll hanging from a boxy-lamped chandelier), the effects mostly have a sense of weightlessness, and the swirl of color offers little to catch the eye. Despite his aptitude for verse, Branagh can’t do much to direct a line like “Some said I was mad. They wouldn’t listen to me. Guess what? They’re listening now” — other than maybe to cut it, which he hasn’t. Once a portrayer of Hamlet’s antic disposition, Branagh has made a movie that is simply antic. Artemis FowlRated PG.

‘Bacurau’ Review: Life and Death in a Small Brazilian Town - The New York Times,"townsfolk facing a violent threat — and bats it around until it all goes ka-boom. Part of what’s exciting is how the filmmakers marshal genre in the service of their ideas, using film form to deflect, tease and surprise. The movie looks and plays like a western but also flirts with dystopian science fiction and pure pulp: bang, bang, splat. By the time the cult actor Udo Kier rolls up it’s clear that anything gleefully goes. It’s also obvious that the writer-directors Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles are having a good time, and they want you to have one too. Dornelles has worked as a production designer on Mendonça Filho’s movies, including his sui generis “Neighboring Sounds” and “Aquarius.” Their partnership proves seamless on “Bacurau,” which flows despite a switch-backing story that starts with a truck bouncing along a remote highway, a woman riding shotgun. The countryside is green in the way of certain deserts, but empty coffins litter the road, along with a corpse. It is quite the enigmatic opener, a variant on those puzzlers that begin with a body sprawled on the parlor floor next to a bloody candelabrum. But there’s no clever detective to put the pieces together. (You have to do that yourself.) There’s also no obvious narrative blueprint and precious little exposition. There are instead beauties, mysteries and characters, like that passenger, Teresa (Bárbara Colen), who arrives in Bacurau on the day of a funeral. As Teresa walks through the seemingly empty town, dragging a suitcase, she passes its boozy doctor, Domingas (Sônia Braga, the one and only). And then Teresa hails a man who pops a hallucinogen in her mouth. The filmmakers spend the first half of the movie introducing the town of Bacurau; they drop you in the middle of it — without an evident story — then nose around its streets and secrets. There’s a pretty white church, but it’s used for storage, and a sturdy little museum built of stone. More characters pop in, including Teresa’s sexy friend, Acácio (Thomas Aquino), who has bedroom eyes and a gun in his waistband. He may be a thief or an insurgent; it’s hard to tell. Bacurau’s younger inhabitants like to watch a recording of him executing people. It looks like a video game and this is the future, but life is still cruel, as is evident once more bloody corpses start piling up. In his earlier features, Mendonça Filho used different spaces and homes — a middle-class neighborhood, a derelict plantation, an apartment threatened with demolition — as conduits to ideas about history, community, surveillance and power. These same issues swirl through “Bacurau,” which eventually settles into a brutal, disturbing story about haves and have-nots, a social division that Mendonça Filho and Dornelles make ferociously literal. This can be read as a metaphor about Brazil (and the inequities that trouble the larger world), but like Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai” this is also a story deeply rooted in a precisely mapped place. That place is Brazil’s backcountry or sertão and, even more specifically, a quilombo, one of the many settlements originally founded by escaped enslaved people. In “Bacurau,” the filmmakers have created a version of a settlement that Mendonça Filho, in an interview with Film Comment, called a “remixed quilombo”: “a black community, a historical place of resistance, but with some white, indigenous, trans and other inhabitants.” When, midway through, some townspeople begin practicing capoeira — a combat game that originated with enslaved Africans — they are both communing with that history of defiance and readying for a new battle. Right before things heat up, two ominous strangers ride up to Bacurau. Like latter-day cowboys, they wander into a modest store filled with hanging animal carcasses and buzzing flies, a setting that’s as unassuming as it is skin-crawlingly creepy (much like this movie). When one of the strangers asks the female proprietor what the villagers are called, her son shouts “people!” The proprietor then explains that the town is named for a bird, and the stranger asks if it’s extinct. Not here, the Bacurau woman says with a smile — it comes out at night and it is a hunter. When the fight finally arrives it’s by turns absurd and horrifying. The second half of “Bacurau” is unsparing in its violence, filled with gunfire, terror in the night and revolutionary fervor that skews pathological. There’s a bandit in eyeliner, a fierce squirt (Silvero Pereira), and a gang of Americans right out of a Hollywood blowout. After an hour of silky camera moves, amusing details and a deep sense of history, Mendonça Filho and Dornelles switch gears, fold in a homage to John Carpenter and go berserk, unleashing a nightmare that’s all the worse for being eerily like life.

"‘The Invisible Man’ Review: Gaslight Nation, Domestic Edition - The New York Times","squeaking and creaking and an abruptly deployed bang — as Cecilia, eyes brightly shining, creeps through the shadows. Working well with his limited budget, Whannell also makes expressive use of Adrian’s cold, self-flattering modernist lair with its walls of glass and sharp angles. Perched on a cliff over the Pacific’s crashing waves, the house is at once an emblem of male success and a female prison, much like ye olde Gothic mansions. With the help of her sister (Harriet Dyer), Cecilia finds refuge at the house of a close friend, James (Aldis Hodge), who lives with his teenage daughter (Storm Reid). Cecilia tries to settle into her freedom, but — much like the audience — remains on high alert, body trembling and gaze nervously shuttling. Then word comes that Adrian has committed suicide, leaving Cecilia a small fortune administered by Adrian’s shifty, unctuous brother (Michael Dorman, giving good sleaze). She finds all this rather hard to take, having a rightly suspicious mind. But this twist allows her to let down her guard, creating a teasing calm that well-trained horror fans know is only temporary. Whannell does a lot that’s smart here, including the way he uses bodies in rooms. He likes to isolate Cecilia in the shot, surrounding her with negative space that at first seems to be just visually expressing her feelings of isolation. This dovetails with how he deploys differing points of view, as he shifts from what Cecilia sees to seemingly unmotivated camera moves, like a pan to an empty corner. Even as Cecilia relaxes into her newfound liberation, Whannell keeps signaling that something is very much amiss. Minor mishaps — a kitchen fire, a falling knife — further flick your nerves and by the time the front door mysteriously swings open, you are primed for the worst. Moss’s full-bore performance — anchored by her extraordinarily supple face — gives the movie its emotional stakes. The figure of the imperiled woman tends to be irresistible, but you need to care about the character, too, really share her worries and her terrors. With her high forehead, prominent jawline and eyes that can pop or menacingly narrow, Moss has an ideal big-screen canvas, one she fills with subtle fluctuations that let you follow Cecilia’s inner states even when she goes quiet. Directors like to over-pump Moss’s tears (she’s a real sob sister), but here the waterworks don’t gush, which complicates the idea of Cecilia as a hapless victim. Whannell has fun with the story’s unseen menace, sometimes a touch too enthusiastically. He builds the scares scene by scene, ramping up the shocks from eeks to shrieks as Cecilia’s renewed isolation and abuse grow progressively worse. Certain moments drift into sadism (there’s some ugly knife work), though this is also part of the genre handbook. Cecilia needs to endure a punishing ordeal and fight for her life as she tries to convince a skeptical world that the threat isn’t in her head. (Never was!) She’s being gaslighted, and while her agony can be unnerving, it is even more shivery when her weeping stops and this horror-movie damsel in distress becomes a threat.

"‘Zombi Child’ Review: Race, Class and Voodoo - The New York Times","or, if you are disinclined to trust Bonello, of evasion. The connection between ritual and revenge in Haitian custom and race and class hierarchies in contemporary France gets a deliberate teasing out here. The movie opens in Haiti in 1962. In a dark room, a man chops up a dead blowfish. He pulverizes the parts into powder, which he sprinkles on the insoles of a pair of shoes. Those shoes incapacitate another man wearing them; he dies, is buried and is revived as a zombie, enslaved, to cut cane in a field with other such afflicted people. Bonello then moves to a girls’ boarding school in present-day France. A professor lectures on the French Revolution and Napoleon’s co-opting of it, which, he argues, also paradoxically fulfilled it. He points out that “liberalism obscures liberty.” Outside of class, the girls have different concerns. Fanny (Louise Labèque), a pretty girl with a blank face framed by lustrous brown hair, and whose love letters to an unknown person sometimes play on the soundtrack, has befriended Mélissa (Wislanda Louimat), another attractive teenager who also seems to be the only person of color at the school. Fanny initiates Mélissa into her clique; at a candlelit ceremony, the other girls ask Mélissa to reveal something personal. She recites a text that begins, “Listen white world; listen to my zombie voice.” Bonello, never much interested in narrative momentum, keeps the idea of story at a steady distance for the first hour. Then he reveals Fanny’s love object and has Fanny approach Mélissa’s aunt Mambo Katy (Katiana Milfort), who, we discover, is the daughter of the zombie we meet at the opening. The younger woman believes Katy to be a voodoo priestess, and asks her for magic relief from erotic obsession. “You have to know the culture,” balks Katy. Fanny sniffs, “Does my unhappiness not count because I’m white and wealthy?”The movie revisits Haiti throughout, time-tripping all the way, as its modern tale puts a genre spin on the theme of cultural appropriation. The movie’s inconclusiveness is the source of its appeal; “Zombi Child” is fueled by insinuation and fascination. Zombi ChildNot rated. In French, Haitian and English, with subtitles.

‘The Disappearance of My Mother’ Review: Son’s View of a Model Parent - The New York Times,"and also, maybe, to be a little afraid of her — the viewer is trapped in a further contradiction. To embrace this movie fully means to accept the case for its nonexistence. At the very least, it’s impossible to watch “The Disappearance of My Mother” without a measure of ambivalence. Gratitude for the chance to make Barzini’s acquaintance, and for Barrese’s sensitivity in making the introduction, is accompanied by ethical queasiness. That is very much the point. Barzini’s critique of the culture of glamour and consumption is not easily refuted, but it is nonetheless partly undermined by her own magnetism. Footage and photographs from her earlier life cast an inevitable spell, as does Barrese’s decision to “cast” young models as versions of his mother. The film opens with screen tests during which these women apply makeup to replicate the grain de beauté that is one of Barzini’s distinguishing rates. Later, they read passages from a memoir in which she recalls her unhappy, wealthy childhood and her subsequent career. This is not “the biography of my mother.” Those unfamiliar with Barzini’s life might consult an interview conducted by one of her nieces and published earlier this decade in Document Magazine. It provides information about her family and her political views that is missing from Barrese’s film, which is more about his mother’s human presence than her history and accomplishments. It is also, of course, about her impending absence — about a mortality that she both dreads and relishes. Her desire to go away isn’t, she says, a suicidal fantasy.

‘Portals’ Review: Snoozing Through Another Dimension - The New York Times,"“doors,” in the film’s parlance, because people can walk through them — variously drive people insane, entice them to enter by showing them the lives they desire and otherwise steal the objectives of monoliths from better science fiction movies. The episodes, which proceed out of chronological order, are interwoven rather than told in a straight progression. One segment — in which a scared family takes a road trip to grandma’s — pops up like commercial breaks between the other sections, for instance. An expository prologue returns as an epilogue during the closing credits, at a point past when understandably impatient viewers will have left. Signs of intelligent life occasionally surface. “Call Center,” directed by Eduardo Sanchez (“The Blair Witch Project”) and Gregg Hale, is set among 911 operators during the early stages of the panic, a promising idea without a payoff. “Sarah,” set three minutes before the blackout in an anonymous parking garage in Jakarta, takes advantage of the potential that the world-going-mad scenario affords for long camera movements — although the director, Timo Tjahjanto, looks to have been more concerned with hitting his marks than with the quality of the acting. It is difficult to believe that an actual first encounter with interdimensional beings would be such a complete waste of time. PortalsNot rated.

‘Satanic Panic’ Review: A Pizza Party for the Prince of Darkness - The New York Times,"the plucky virgin, the devilish matron — but its throwback “final girl” narrative avoids being merely regressive. The movie stands out from contemporary horror for its lack of pretension and its simple commitment to inventing ways for pretty people to get slaughtered. Characters are disemboweled, heroines vomit bugs — the film thrills with gore and grotesquerie. Forgoing the all-too-familiar slickness of computer-generated imagery, Stardust instead showcases old-school practical effects, bringing imaginative glee to her colorful conjuring with every line and image.

‘Ready or Not’ Review: The Run-and-Slay Bride - The New York Times,"especially if the blade is wielded by a disadvantaged Joe or Jane. That’s certainly the case with Grace (a fantastic Samara Weaving) in “Ready or Not,” a blood-drenched, joke-sprinkled harpooning of soul-sucking greed and inbred family values. A former foster child, Grace is eager to marry her ultrawealthy husband, Alex (Mark O’Brien), but not for his money: she’s so keen to have a real family that even his dauntingly odd extended brood will suffice. Until now, Alex has resisted. An heir to a board-game dynasty (“We prefer ‘dominion,’” he tells her), he’s been virtually estranged from his off-putting relatives. As a brief prologue suggests, he had very good reason. So when a post-nuptials family meeting is called to inform Grace that tradition requires her to play an initiation game of Hide-and-Seek, he’s visibly nervous. Off she scuttles in her wedding dress to cram herself into a dumbwaiter, blithely unaware that, somewhere below in this sprawling, Addams-family mansion, her in-laws are arming themselves to the teeth with old-timey weapons. If she survives until dawn, they believe their fortune will disappear; as they’ll find out, the reality is infinitely more messy. Directed, with more efficiency than novelty, by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (two-thirds of the collective known as Radio Silence), “Ready or Not” turns the home-invasion thriller inside out. Relentless and thoroughly preposterous, Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy’s script hews to its own batty logic, its frantic pacing peppered with morbid humor. Alex’s coke-fueled sister keeps accidentally killing the help, and a wicked Andie MacDowell, as Grace’s implacably murderous mother-in-law, is clearly having a blast with that ancient bow and arrow. But it’s Weaving who gives this blunt satire of class warfare a heart. Surrounded by cartoon villains, she’s easy to applaud: There’s no side to Grace, just a fearless decency and school-of-hard-knocks scrappiness that’s never diluted with a nudge or a wink. Her performance — like the tormented way that Adam Brody, playing Alex’s vaguely dissipated brother, delivers his too-few lines — reminds us that extreme wealth is often paid for by the suffering of others. Her deconstructed wedding dress, on the other hand, simply screams that women should think twice before asking for that ring. Ready or NotRated R for ubiquitous splatter and satanic invocations. Running time: 1 hour and 35 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/movies/ready-or-not-review.html
‘Halston’ Review: The Designer as Unsolved Mystery - The New York Times,"cutting along the bias — was basically a biblical miracle. (Women were completely naked under their Halstons. The man had, we’re told, “hands of gold.” And the patterns looked “like a Cuisinart blade.”) A Halston fashion show was a theatrical event that included, with aberrant nonchalance for the times, black models. Liza Minnelli was — and remains — a true-blue bestie. Both the designer and the brand became essential to ideas of attire in the ’70s and early ’80s. (The company made uniforms for the Girl Scouts, the folks at Avis, and the American athletes of the ’76 Olympics; he cut a deal to glamorize the average woman for J. C. Penney, making him a granddaddy of the mass-market fashion collaboration.)Even through the Studio 54 era and the drug-assisted (or drug-induced) workaholism; even though, as the film rewinds to assert, Halston could be a tyrant, things were humming. But then big business — or rather really big business — entered in 1983 and had some concerns. The company’s new corporate parent, Esmark, scrutinized the budgets, and the exorbitant old days seemed doomed. The film details power struggles and ego trips and culture clashes. And the folks gathered here to do the enumerating — his assistants, his pals, one of his boyfriends, the models, the executives, his niece, a movingly protective Minnelli, the dude who erased the tapes — paint such a vivid picture of the atmosphere around Halston, the man and the industry, that you almost don’t mind that Halston himself remains elusive. That’s partly a matter of his indirect participation (he died in 1990, at 57, of AIDS) and because he was as grand a fortress as his buddy Andy Warhol. He’s the mystery the film is trying to solve but can’t. All of that stuff with Gevinson, whose years as a young fashion blogger entitle her to do more here than Tcheng’s droning, seems amateurishly literal. And that’s strange for Tcheng, who’s directed or co-directed good fashion films, about Diana Vreeland and Christian Dior. He’s reaching here. And yet I liked the deluge of visual information and personalities. The pictures, footage, biography, news and gossip are the opposite of a Halston dress — unruly, busy, fussed over. But they come at you with an energy that feels substantial. Knowing what to do with all of that material is its own kind of intelligence. Why overthink it? Or: why show us what you’ve overthought?",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/movies/halston-review.html
‘Trial by Fire’ Review: A Strong Case Against the Death Penalty - The New York Times,"Jack O’Connell does his level best to make Willingham more than the standard-issue Hollywood Complex Roughneck, while Laura Dern, as a prison pen pal who becomes a defense ally, is a reliably elevating presence — the movie’s raw facts are sufficient to rouse viewer indignation. But the material arguably calls for a more proactively provocative approach.

‘Asher’ Review: An Aging Hit Man Finds Love - The New York Times,"My own criminal days being well behind me, I could not speak to the real-life validity of the movie-world truism that professional hit men rarely live long enough to consider what to do once they reach retirement age. Particularly when aches and pains start interfering with the work. Not too long into “Asher,” directed by Michael Caton-Jones and featuring Ron Perlman in the title hit man role, the hired killer has something that might be a heart attack while on the job. The story of a delivery man for death reckoning with his own mortality could really be something. But “Asher” instead tries for the wistful and wise late-life romance. Asher, a former Mossad operative (or so it’s implied) who now operates out of a predominantly Jewish area of Brooklyn’s Williamsburg, is helped by Famke Janssen’s Sophie, who lives near Asher’s intended victim. The two find a halting affinity even as Asher hides his practices from her. Soon, Sophie blurts to him: “My mother has dementia. She asked me to kill her. Imagine actually … killing someone.” Awkward. The performers, who also include Jacqueline Bisset as Sophie’s mother and Richard Dreyfuss as a voluble crime boss, keep the viewer hoping for the best. Caton-Jones and the cinematographer Denis Crossan aim for autumnal visual texture via many shallow-focus shots with diffused brown and orange lights in the background. Unfortunately the pace is so relaxed as to be meandering; and Jay Zaretsky’s screenplay is cliché-packed, as when Asher brings Sophie to his forest cabin with the words, “We’ll be safe here.”",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/movies/asher-review.html
Review: ‘Nelly’ Offers a Complex Portrait of a Woman on the Verge - The New York Times,"seductive sex object for pay, philosophically minded writer, enraged jealous girlfriend. When the Quebec-based woman achieves literary success after the publication of her first novel, “Putain” (“Whore”), she dismisses inquiries as to its autobiographical content by saying such questions lack “imagination.” Fame and intellectual respect don’t solve her problems with reconciling herself to herself, as she can’t be sure of who she even is. “I need to be seen, but it’s not me I reveal,” she tells her therapist (whom she later tries to seduce). The character Ms. Émond and Ms. Mackay create is not likable, but is puzzling in an engrossing way. I am not sufficiently familiar with Ms. Fortier’s work to weigh in on how accurately this film represents it, but as an act of complex homage, “Nelly” gets to a few interesting places.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/movies/nelly-review.html

Review: ‘Show Dogs’ Is a Shaggy Good Time - The New York Times,"Sometimes a rewarding movie theater experience comes from a simple film that doesn’t promise more than it can deliver. “Show Dogs” promises talking dogs who fight crime. It delivers. In Raja Gosnell’s canine comedy, Max (voiced by Ludacris) is a laconic Rottweiler with the New York Police Department who sniffs the trail of an international animal smuggling ring. When the clues lead to a swanky dog show in Las Vegas, Max is assigned to the case as the pooch partner for Frank (Will Arnett), a combative F. B. I. agent. Aided by Frank’s agency contacts and Max’s purebred informants, the two search for their human culprit. “Show Dogs” mixes digital effects with footage of trained dogs to achieve its elaborate flights of fancy. One result of having real dogs on screen is that the dumbest of the doggy dialogue is easy to tune out in favor of the amiably dunderheaded pleasure of watching a pack of pups solve crime. Moments of cleverness zing out from the din, as when RuPaul voices a four-legged fashionista, or a spectacular Komondor (Shaquille O’Neal) offers Max his best Zen mantras. Enthusiasts for particular breeds may be disappointed to find that “Show Dogs” spotlights Rottweilers and Papillons over bulldogs and bloodhounds, but more frustrating for the impartial dog lover is the extreme imbalance of screen time between male and female dogs. In a movie intended for families, it is frustrating that both humans and hounds who are gendered female find themselves relegated to love interest roles. But if “Show Dogs” sometimes betrays its shaggy charms, there is comfort in remembering that many movies are much dumber than this one, and so few of them have either the good taste or the good manners to compensate with puppies.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/movies/show-dogs-review-will-arnett-ludacris-rupaul.html
Review: ‘Roxanne Roxanne’ Is a Slice of Old-School Hip-Hop Life - The New York Times,"In 1984, Lolita Shante Gooden, a 14-year-old from Queens, was on her way to do laundry when she became a hip-hop star. A producer stopped her and asked if she would rap over some beats from “Roxanne Roxanne,” a hit by UTFO about a girl who wouldn’t respond to a guy’s advances. She freestyled some rhymes from the perspective of the girl in the song, punching back with force and style. Her song, “Roxanne’s Revenge,” became a hit, and Lolita transformed into Roxanne Shante, one of the first female hip-hop stars. This origin story may be accurate, but make no mistake: It’s also made for Hollywood. And yet what distinguishes “Roxanne Roxanne,” a sensitively observed new movie with a dynamite performance by Chanté Adams, is that it marries a traditional hip-hop biopic, a form long dominated by male rappers, with a more idiosyncratic and deeply felt slice of life. This movie’s intimate indie vibe is a nice match for the old-school subject, rap stardom in the days before hip-hop culture went global. The director, Michael Larnell, shows you the warts and all, but he nimbly steers clear of another cautionary tale about the evils of show business. Nor is this a superhero story with microphones and Adidas replacing utility belts and capes. (The 1980s period design here is every bit as lovingly recreated as it is on “Stranger Things.”)The music is a backdrop for a gripping, often brutal story of the struggles of a girl growing up poor in Queens. Ms. Adams delivers a compassionate performance as a girl whose swagger and practicality hides a melancholy edge. Stardom changes her life, but less than you’d think. Early scenes show Lolita resorting to petty crime to support her family and butting heads with her strict mother (Nia Long), a compelling character who could use more screen time. And then there’s a small galaxy of men that disappoint or abuse both mother and daughter. As her older love interest, Mahershala Ali gives a silky performance with ominous undertones that never turns into caricature. The scenes between him and Ms. Adams are charged, filmed with a patient if herky-jerky pacing. Some shots linger longer than necessary. At other times, Mr. Larnell cuts quickly, shifting from a shot of sex to pregnancy in a blink. You get a sense of the film’s dramatic priorities from the first scene. Roxanne paces the streets preparing for a rap battle as a crowd of friends trail her. From the look on her face, you can tell she’s formidable, and when she faces off against a guy who scoffs at her, you wait for the virtuoso performance. But then the film cuts away. Don’t worry: There will be rap battles and concert scenes and they do not disappoint. But they are the bass line beat. The drama of ordinary life is what makes this story stick in your head.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/movies/roxanne-roxanne-review-roxanne-shante.html
Review: ‘Nostalgia’ Asks Why We Keep Things - The New York Times,"inspired by a 2013 article in The New York Times — gains thematic heft from exceptionally strong performances. Catherine Keener and James LeGros excel as a grieving couple, and Mikey Madison (riveting as the eldest daughter in FX’s “Better Things,”) is so moving as Kathleen, a mourning teenager, that we want to give her her own movie. Fascinated by the Portuguese word “saudade,” Kathleen defines it as “a pleasure you suffer, a pain you enjoy.” If that’s what Mr. Pellington was going for, he was half successful.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/movies/nostalgia-review.html
"Review: A Sci-Fi Thriller, ‘Beyond Skyline’ Is Beyond Ridiculous - The New York Times","In this peculiar piece of sci-fi sensationalism, Frank Grillo plays Mark, a tough Los Angeles cop, now suspended from the force, whom we first see springing his ne’er-do-well adult son, Trent, from the hoosegow. A stalled truck forces the two to take the subway, at which time their city is subject to a very gnarly alien attack. The prospect of a hybrid of “Battle: Los Angeles” (2011) and Andrzev Wajda’s “Kanal” (1956) is not necessarily displeasing, but as it happens, “Beyond Skyline,” written and directed by Liam O’Donnell, is much, much more. (Among other things, it’s a kind of sequel to the 2010 film “Skyline,” for which Mr. O’Donnell was one of the two screenwriters, retaining its aliens but jettisoning its characters.)Fleeing the invaders via subway tunnels doesn’t work, so soon Mark, Trent and a few stock types are in an alien ship, besieged by fearsome creatures with tentacles that unscrew the tops of human heads. One of the captives is a blind Vietnam vet, which is interesting, because eventually the alien ship crashes in Laos, right on the Mekong River, where Mark must protect the newborn he delivered on the ship. (Long story.) The movie, which lists several Asian companies as co-producers, then morphs into a sci-fi martial arts picture, featuring a scene in which a woman lures a giant alien beast into a minefield. Whether you find this as much fun to watch as it is to describe will depend on your tolerance for clichés in dialogue (“I’m so sorry your family is gone. But killing yourself … is not gonna change that”), music (lots of string sections syncopating in high register) and much else. Also in how credible you find Mr. Grillo as an action star. I remain “meh” on him, but I did admire this movie’s near-lunatic genre-hopping.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/movies/beyond-skyline-review.html

As its lovers coyly tango into bed, the film confuses dark, meaningful gazes and stumbling monosyllabic conversation with insight and feeling. This first feature film by Alan Jacobs follows the relationship of Nina (Laura San Giacomo), a San Francisco shoe-store clerk, with an unnamed Welsh photographer (Paul Rhys) while her husband is away on a three-week business trip. The lovers meet cute in a park where she is sitting behind him, crunching on an apple so loudly that the sound interferes with the music on his headphones. As their courtship progresses, Nina shows up in the park with a gift: the perfect baseball cap. Later, she appears with a portable stereo and tries to instruct him in ballroom dancing. Annoyed, he accuses her of trying to make a fool of him. The couple enjoy playing desultory games of telephone tag on each other's answering machines. When they do connect, Nina pretends to be wearing a black silk nightgown, while her lover says he is undressed. Moments later, they call each other's bluffs. In bed, they experiment with a blindfold but decide that it's more fun to have sex while making eye contact. These details are related to a glum journalist (Michael O'Keefe), who is researching a story about marriage and infidelity. In a subplot, Nina's best friend (Cristi Conaway) has an affair with Paulie (Fisher Stevens), the slimy manager of a coffee bar, who dispenses leering advice about tamping down coffee grounds to get the perfect cup of espresso. Nina generously lets the couple tryst in her apartment, only to be accused of sleeping with Paulie, who has stolen a pair of Nina's panties and left them on the seat of his car.""Nina Takes a Lover,"" which opens today at Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, aspires to be a gently amused evocation of sexual boredom within marriage. It even offers a novel solution to the problem.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. MEET Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis), two renegades living out the oldest story in the teen-age wasteland. They're young, they're in love and they kill people, in thrill-crazy, rock-video style. ""If I don't kill you,"" Mickey says to one soon-to-be victim, ""what is there to talk about?"" For Mickey, it's more than just a rhetorical question. With more sophistry than poetry, Oliver Stone apotheosizes these trash archetypes in ""Natural Born Killers,"" his supposed satire about an America despoiled by violence and exploitation. Satire? In his skill as a manipulator of thoughts and images, in his short-circuiting ordinary narrative, and in his intuitive visual brilliance, Mr. Stone could well turn out to be the most influential American film maker of his generation. But as a satirist, he's an elephant ballerina. Scratch the frenzied, hyperkinetic surface of ""Natural Born Killers"" and you find remarkably banal notions about Mickey, Mallory and the demon media. (""Media's like weather, only it's man-made weather,"" says Mickey, delivering one of the rare memorable lines in the screenplay.) To wit: Born bad. Blame society. The sins of the fathers. Lost innocence. True love. Wild horses, deadly rattlers, fireworks, freight trains. Elements like these would appear more honestly threadbare if Mr. Stone were not a match for Mickey and Mallory in the area of overkill. But he has exploded the slender premise of ""Natural Born Killers"" (from a story by Quentin Tarantino, whose distinctive voice is not heard here) into a firestorm of quick cuts, hot colors, gyroscopic camera movements and emblematic visions. Such techniques, intensified so furiously (thanks to superb editing by Hank Corwin and Brian Berdan) that they become pharmacologically seductive, have a way of obscuring this film's more mundane troubles. Not least of them is the fact that ""Natural Born Killers"" is dense and unmodulated enough to be exhausting. Despite isolated moments of bleak, disturbing beauty, it is finally less an epiphany than an ordeal. Not for the first time, Mr. Stone assembles an arsenal of visual ideas and then fires away point-blank in his audience's direction. If viewers flinch during this tireless two-hour barrage, are they simply no match for the film maker's tough, unrelenting style? Or has he by now perfected his own form of exploitative fallacy? While ""Natural Born Killers"" affects occasional disgust at the lurid world of Mickey and Mallory, it more often seems enamored of their exhilarating freedom. If there is a juncture at which these caricatures start looking like nihilist heroes, then the film passes that point many times. Meanwhile, how can anything Mr. Stone says about his characters be dismissed as tasteless or unfunny, since they themselves are meant to be embodiments of a tasteless world? ""I Love Mallory,"" a grotesque sitcom version of Mallory's childhood, with Rodney Dangerfield in stained underwear as her lecherous father, is fairly typical of the film's light touch. Arriving on the scene as the Prince Charming who will rescue Mallory by helping to murder her parents, Mickey shows up carrying a dripping 50-pound bag of raw meat. Equally representative is an opening sequence at a roadside restaurant, where Mallory taunts the locals by writhing seductively to the jukebox, then savagely attacks a man who tries to flirt with her. At first, while this goes on, Mickey simply sits at the counter, reading a newspaper whose headline says he and Mallory have just killed six teen-agers at a slumber party. Then he joins in, as Mr. Stone pumps up the music, switches film stock, lets the camera sway vertiginously, shows a bullet circling playfully toward the scared face of someone about to die, and so on. Grand flourish: when the spree is over, Mickey and Mallory dance together to ""La Vie en Rose,"" with fireworks exploding romantically behind them. Mini-witticism: Mickey may have killed almost everyone in sight, but when he spoke to the waitress, he ordered nonfat milk. Unfolding in only semi-linear fashion, ""Natural Born Killers"" devotes its first hour to Mickey and Mallory's rampage, interspersing lurid bloodshed with moments of eerie tenderness. (After the opening slaughter, these two find themselves in the moonlight, with a holy glow enveloping Mallory as she squats in the dirt and speaks about angels.) The couple's blood wedding, with an exchange of rattlesnake rings and Mallory's white veil drifting off into the abyss of a deep canyon, offers one of the film's most genuinely haunting visions, if only because it eludes easy understanding. That's hardly the case with ""American Maniacs,"" the tabloid television show starring Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.), who appreciates Mickey and Mallory for their entertainment value. At one of its funnier moments, the film dwells on the show's re-enactment of their exploits, with a title that says ""A Dramatization"" as two actors, playing Mickey and Mallory, shoot a bicyclist identified as an American bronze medalist. Finally persuading Mickey to sit for an interview after 50 killings in three weeks, Wayne asks the inevitable question: ""Any regrets?""As played by Mr. Downey with a thick Australian accent and perfect lip-smacking unctuousness, Wayne is one of the film's more deft inventions. But he, like everything else about ""Natural Born Killers,"" is allowed to go overboard. After their operatic arrest in a ghastly, green-lit drugstore (another of Mr. Stone's genuinely disturbing images), Mickey and Mallory go to prison and are manipulated by a leering detective (Tom Sizemore) and a publicity-happy warden (Tommy Lee Jones). Even before it culminates in an actual riot, this section of the film becomes hysterical, to the point where it even features the rare out-of-control performance from Mr. Jones. Mr. Harrelson and Ms. Lewis deal as captivatingly as they can with the film's wavering attitudes toward their characters. Both hit the requisite raw nerves, and both also make sense of the material's occasional romantic reveries. Used in a labored effort to give this story a spiritual dimension is Russell Means, as the only character in the film whose life means anything to Mickey and Mallory. Balthazar Getty is seen briefly as a young man who gets killed at a gas station, which probably qualifies as some kind of black joke. Mr. Harrelson looks wild-eyed and deadly during parts of ""Natural Born Killers,"" but he is at his scariest when serenely telling Wayne that he feels possessed of a certain purity. ""I don't think I'm any scarier than you are,"" he says. ""That's your shadow on the wall. You can't get rid of your shadow, can you, Wayne?"" The point is made even more chillingly over the closing credits, as Leonard Cohen, a true poet of doom, sings succinctly: ""Get ready for the future, it is murder.""Just before those credits roll, Mr. Stone shoots himself in the foot with a quick montage of tabloid television's latest, greatest hits: the Bobbitt and Menendez trials, Tonya Harding, O. J. Simpson. For better or worse, those are spectacles that cast a long shadow. And for all its surface passions, ""Natural Born Killers"" never digs deep enough to touch the madness of such events, or even to send them up in any surprising way. Mr. Stone's vision is impassioned, alarming, visually inventive, characteristically overpowering. But it's no match for the awful truth.""Natural Born Killers"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language, sexual situations and extreme, frequent violence, of the sort that could well have warranted a tougher rating.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. In the frankly touristy ""Only You,"" a Pittsburgh schoolteacher named Faith flees her dull fiance and races off to Italy, traveling cute in a black raincoat over a bouffant wedding dress. Supposedly the purpose of this trip is Faith's finding her true soul mate, a man whose name -- Damon Bradley -- she has been given by a Ouija board. Actually it's all about scenery, as the story moves from Venice to Rome to Positano, stopping for suitably fabulous vistas and fountains and flowers. There are worse things than commissioning Sven Nykvist to photograph Italy at its most picturesque. One of those worse things was assigning the role of Faith to Marisa Tomei, who may be the least convincing actress ever to pretend to teach school. Too adorable by half, Ms. Tomei does nothing here to recall that her comic talents (in ""My Cousin Vinny"") have brought her an Academy Award. This performance does suggest that if the current mania for feature-length films based on old television shows ever extends to ""That Girl,"" the Marlo Thomas role will be easy to cast. Ms. Tomei does have the advantage of statuesque good looks, which are greatly enhanced by Milena Canonero's slinky, glamorous costumes and do something to compensate for her brittle, bright-eyed delivery. ""Only You"" is only about appearances anyway. It's the kind of film in which strangers applaud when young lovers kiss and tourists say things like ""He promised to take me on a tour of the fountains.""Trying for either ""Roman Holiday"" or something in the tradition of his own ""Moonstruck"" (and throwing in glimpses of a great big moon whenever possible), Mr. Jewison takes a voluptuously cornball approach to this story. And the story itself, by Diane Drake, is actually rather sweet. In search of her phantom lover, Faith ignores the fact that she has met Mr. Right. He is Mr. Peter Wright (Robert Downey Jr.), to be precise. But when he figures out that only Damon Bradley can make Faith happy, he calls himself Damon Bradley instead. Meanwhile, Faith's sister-in-law, Kate (Bonnie Hunt), decides to make a much-needed getaway from Faith's brother, Larry (Fisher Stevens), a Pittsburgh roofer. Once in Rome, she is courted by Giovanni (Joaquim de Almeida), a skilled hand-kisser who knows what unhappily married American tourists like. (They like rooftop restaurants with nice views of Rome and exclamations like: ""La bella Italia! She's waiting!"")Meanwhile, mistaken identity and the Damon Bradley question keep Faith in a series of swoons and snits, while love-struck Peter Wright waits for her to come to her senses. A yacht figures prominently in these developments. So does Billy Zane, who has some funny moments as a handsome Mr. Wrong. Mr. Downey, who recently weathered ""Natural Born Killers,"" continues to prove how versatile and entertaining he can be in any surroundings. Even in this stock role, he shows off a lively comic style. ""Only You"" also includes a first-rate supporting performance from Ms. Hunt, who makes a fine sardonic sidekick for Ms. Tomei. Mr. de Almeida, last seen as part of the drug underworld in ""Clear and Present Danger,"" goes from sinister to suave without missing a beat. Mr. Stevens also has a few amusing moments, during which he pronounces ""Italy"" as a two-syllable word. Mr. Jewison does his utmost to keep ""Only You"" big and glossy, but sometimes reality intrudes. The film conspicuously plugs every hotel and restaurant it features, doubtless meaning to help viewers who'd like to make travel plans. Not shown: the exciting moment when Faith, Kate, Peter and Larry return home from their mad escapades and open those credit card bills.""Only You"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity, mild sexual situations and brief, partial nudity.

About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The tough, muscular characters in Lee Tamahori's ferocious ""Once Were Warriors"" are primed for fighting. And they need no battlefield: their hostilities are played out in the bedroom, in front of the children or in crowded bars. In his visceral first feature, Mr. Tamahori offers social realism with a savage kick, depicting Maori New Zealanders whose ties to their own history have been destroyed. Left floundering in an inhospitable urban world, they have lost touch with their tribal past to become part of a rootless global subculture. The misery seen here would be familiar anywhere. Having said he hoped to make a film that would stand viewers' hair on end, Mr. Tamahori fully realizes that goal. ""Once Were Warriors,"" a tale of vicious brawls within the family of Beth Heke (Rena Owen) and her belligerent husband, Jake (Temuera Morrison), is a brutally effective family drama. Rough around the edges and crudely obvious at times, it still presents a raw, disturbing story of domestic strife. Only when he tries to look on the bright side does Mr. Tamahori sound false notes. Both this film's stars are frighteningly credible, in part because they both look like pure sinew and brawn. Beth has long tied herself to a violently abusive husband, but ""Once Were Warriors"" makes it clear that she is not simply a victim. Ms. Owen, a fiery actress with the sad, sensual look of a hard-knocks Jeanne Moreau, radiates a physical vitality that makes sense of this union. Against her better judgment, Beth falls for Jake's swagger even while she recoils from his bullying cruelty. Jake sports the tattoos, black leather and heavy musculature that make most of the film's characters resemble members of a biker gang. There's something poignant about their need to dress interchangeably and look fierce in this way. The film's male characters are drawn together in boozy solidarity, grasping for the collective identity that vanished with their Maori tribal life. When Jake brings home his drunken buddies for middle-of-the-night parties in the Heke household, the revelers sing together as if they were gathered around a campfire, wishing for a fellowship that no longer exists in their everyday lives. Behavior within this group is ritualized and sharply divided along male and female lines. While the men brawl heartily and glower at their women, the women are meant to stand by admiringly and gossip about the men's sexual prowess. When we first see her, Beth still accepts these ground rules, however grudgingly. ""You're a hard lady,"" Jake tells her, delivering what sounds like the highest compliment of which he's capable.""You're a hard man, Jakey,"" she replies.""Once Were Warriors"" begins with the sharp contrast of an idyllic New Zealand landscape -- which turns out to be a billboard -- and the gray, crumbling reality of the film's actual setting. It is no less startling in first showing how violently Jake's mean streak contrasts with his physical appeal. As a late-night party disintegrates, Jake hauls off and punches Beth's face, beating her so badly that she doesn't dare attend a court hearing the next morning. One of the Hekes' five children winds up in a state institution after that. All of them know the kind of battering their mother has regularly endured. Adapted by Riwia Brown from a less optimistic novel by Alan Duff, and shifting the story's emphasis from Jake to Beth, ""Once Were Warriors"" uses the Heke children to show the toll taken by their parents' problems. An elder son finds solace with an ornately tattooed leather gang, which has a family's closeness and a steelier sense of identity than Jake's sodden crowd; a younger boy, sent to that state home, regains some sense of Maori pride when he's away from his father. Grace (the gentle, affecting Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell), the family's teen-age daughter, suffers in ways she won't describe even to her best friend, a homeless boy who lives in an abandoned car. It takes her children's unhappiness to make Beth take a hard look at her life, which leads ""Once Were Warriors"" to some easy grandstanding. The title, from a line about the Maori past, comes from a speech patently constructed to make audiences cheer. That's part of what has made ""Once Were Warriors"" the most popular film in New Zealand's history, but Mr. Tamahori isn't often this facile. The film works not only for its pitiless depiction of these characters' unhappy lives, but also for its genuinely poignant idea of how their collective destiny has gone astray. Director, stars and writers all come from backgrounds that are at least part Maori, and together they create a powerful sense of longing. Except for small roles in ""Rapa Nui"" and slight connections to ""The Piano,"" none of these principals are familiar here, which makes the film's furiously energetic performances seem that much more intense. Mr. Morrison is actually well known in New Zealand for playing a nice-guy doctor on a soap opera. But here he becomes a wildly dangerous presence, a tortured man whose only means of addressing his own pain is in hurting others. Matching Ms. Owen's volatile intensity, he turns Jake's rage into something much angrier than the product of one man's foul temper.""Once Were Warriors"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, sexual situations and graphic domestic violence.

"FILM REVIEW; The Hero Is Hoffman, The Villain a Virus - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from March 10, 1995, Section C, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""I hope that 'Outbreak' is like the 'Jaws' of the 90's,"" the director Wolfgang Petersen has said, offering an invaluable insight into why super-deadly Biosafety Level 4 viruses are such big business this season. Following in the toxic wake of two scarifying nonfiction books, ""The Coming Plague,"" by Laurie Garrett, and ""The Hot Zone,"" Richard Preston's best seller, ""Outbreak"" also overwhelmed another, less virulent movie project (""Crisis in the Hot Zone"") in its rush to bring one of today's ghastliest medical nightmares to the big screen. Why? Well, the fascination of nonfiction virus studies lies in gory details, especially when described in chillingly suspenseful fashion and accompanied by the prospect of a major plague. But the liquefying organs that loom so large in Mr. Preston's account have only limited movie appeal, so a bit more entertainment value was necessary. With that in mind, ""Outbreak"" invents Dr. Roberta (Robby) Keough (Rene Russo) and Dr. Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman), ex-spouses who start off spatting about the custody of their two slurpy dogs and re-team to ward off a calamity. ""The fate of the nation, perhaps the world, is in our hands,"" someone in this film straight-facedly declares. Not trusting the scientific interest of a possible global emergency to rivet audiences, Mr. Petersen comes up with his own cure for undue solemnity: movie hysterics. The signs are telltale: characters pacing importantly down hallways as they bark orders, tracking shots for every occasion, hints of a conspiracy plot, and a loudspeaker ordering the citizens of a small town to ""remain calm."" The town is Cedar Creek, Calif., and it isn't a beach resort, or there might be a shark, too. The last action hero one might expect to find in such a story is Mr. Hoffman, an actor more comfortable in less slam-bang circumstances. The attempt to create a big, bold role for him here is nothing if not blunt. Perhaps to counteract the fact that he spends so much time looking awkward in protective gear, Mr. Hoffman has been given opportunities to commandeer a helicopter, barge into a television station to make an emergency broadcast and reassure a child that he won't be hurting the nice little monkey she mistook for a pet. Production notes for ""Outbreak"" explain how much Mr. Hoffman learned about viruses and epidemiology as he prepared for this role, even if its most arduous requirement was tossing off wisecracks to members of his research team. (When it's time to catch the above-mentioned monkey, tactics don't get much more complex than leaving an apple on a plate where the monkey can find it.) The film's nonchalance is so exaggerated that talk about the Daniels' marital troubles is given the same conversational weight as saving the world from a lethal disease. ""I can't believe you're taking a deadly virus and turning it into a family matter!"" Sam is told. The screenwriters, Laurence Dworet and Robert Roy Pool, should have heard their own warning on that score. There were hints of similar flippancy in ""In the Line of Fire,"" Mr. Petersen's most successful foray into Hollywood-style storytelling. But they were obscured by fine acting, flirty chemistry and a plot with much more genuine excitement than the trumped-up intrigue here. This is a film in which one brave character finds himself stumbling onto Something Big, in this case involving biological warfare. It's the type of conspiracy that involves Donald Sutherland in his sinister mode, and it goes all the way to the top. The obligatory White House scene presents a map of the United States on which a few red dots indicate disease outbreaks. Then the map goes solid red to show just how disastrous matters will soon be, unless Sam Daniels saves the day. Can he do it? Let's just say that Sam is eventually moved to defy his superiors, and that he makes an impassioned plea in behalf of America's soul. In telling such an overheated story, Mr. Petersen loses the essential appeal (though that's the wrong word) of his subject matter: that it might be real, and that in an age of AIDS it has terrible relevance to viewers' lives. The effort to turn ""Outbreak"" into an action picture insures that little of it will be believable, regardless of how much scientific data has been woven into the story. The film's shallowness also contributes to the impression that no problem is too thorny to be solved by movie heroics. If a person spends enough time looking serious, sounding defiant and staring intently at computer screens, all will be well with the world. Mr. Petersen's technical proficiency is on a higher level, delivering genuinely chilling frissons whenever he concentrates on something straightforward, like the specifics of how the disease is spread. Scenes that trace the plague's progress become edgy and suspenseful, especially when contrasted with more hyperbolic events elsewhere in the story. The camera hurtles forward too automatically at the prospect of any excitement, but Michael Ballhaus's cinematography is sharp and nimble, giving ""Outbreak"" a crispness that suits its story. This and colorful production design make the film look more substantial than it sounds. The supporting actors are appealing despite the perfunctoriness of their roles. Morgan Freeman is the longtime military officer torn between conscience and duty. Mr. Sutherland is suitably spooky and wears perfect white hair. Kevin Spacey is the acerbic research sidekick who proves, under pressure, that he's less cavalier than he sounds. Cuba Gooding Jr. is the rookie, which makes him the sounding board for passages explaining lesions, hemorrhages and other virus-related details. Ms. Russo is as pleasing a presence here as she was in ""In the Line of Fire."" She provides warmth, intelligence and window-dressing in equal measure.""Outbreak"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Its gore is relatively discreet, but it graphically illustrates the effects of a deadly plague. OUTBREAK Directed by Wolfgang Petersen; written by Laurence Dworet and Robert Roy Pool; director of photography, Michael Ballhaus; edited by Neil Travis, Lynzee Klingman and William Hoy; music by James Newton Howard; production designer, William Sandell; produced by Arnold Kopelson, Mr. Petersen and Gail Katz; released by Warner Brothers.

THE SCREEN; A Wild-Eyed Story of Empire Is 'The Sun Never Sets' at Music Hall--New Films at Capitol and Palace - The New York Times,"God save the Crown!—the irrepressible Randolph family whose coat-of-arms must be inscribed with a stiff upper lip rampant on a field of whisky-sodas. The Randolphs had been manning the outposts of empire for so long, stoutly swallowing their quinine and their final ""gs,"" that Zurof should have known better than to select their corner of a foreign field—the African gold coast—for the discovery of his mallabadium mine (or whatever the stuff was) and the establishment of his secret radio station. But there he sat, right under the patrician noses of two of the Randolph boys, spreading revolt, strikes, arson, bomb plots and war fever all over the world from his jungle hideaway. Finally the hour neared for the really crucial broadcast. ""If we don't stop it,"" gravely said one of the experts"" in the Home Office, ""the world will be in for it.""Well, the Music Hall is in for it, for off-hand it's hard to recall a sillier salute to our British cousins, or one more embarrassing to its cast, some of whom really seem to have taken it seriously.

Sidney BracyEven though you've heard it before, only a churl would stop Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the middle of a harmless crime story like ""Six Thousand Enemies"" (at the Capitol) since at least it gives employment to pleasant people like Walter Pidgeon, Rita Johnson, Paul Kelly, Nat Pendleton, Grant Mitchell et al. But then, of course, it IS the one about the tough prosecutor who finally gets sent up the river himself; there's no getting around that. If Mr. Pidgeon thinks he can fool us just because he isn't Otto Kruger, he's mistaken; we've been sentenced to so many prison pictures by now, we begin yammering at the sight of a stone wall. The present stretch becomes a pretty tough one before it's over, especially during the sequence in which Walter squares himself with the muggs and the punks by showing them that he can take it as well as dish it out, a method which, in penological circumstances, really seems too Frank Merriwell for words. Then there's the romance that develops between Mr. Pidgeon and Miss Johnson, the latter sent up on an embezzlement charge framed by Harold Huber, just as Walter was sent up on a bribery charge framed by the same human viper. (Mr. Huber, it appears, is the tuber of all evil.)Such moments admittedly are hard to bear, and the memory, for the hypersensitive, may not be totally expunged by the big climactic sequence in which practically everything happens, including a wholesale jail break marked by a regular kermess of machine-gunning, point-blank pistoling, conking and jaw-socking, though all that helps, of course. Incidentally, the appearance of both Nat Pendleton and Guinn (""Big Boy"") Williams in a picture may lead to some confusion among those who have previously had a vague impression that they are one and the same person.

Twentieth Century-Fox has discovered the infallible way for a young man to succeed, to become vice president of his company—and is retailing the information in one fairly easy lesson labeled ""It Could Happen to You,"" now on view at the Palace. The secret: go to a so-called stag party with a bunch of the local big men; get yourself thoroughly plastered and arrive home with a dead night club singer tucked away in the rear seat of your car; notify the police and let them rush you unceremoniously to jail—and then trust the little wife, who has been urging you on all the time, to blackmail your frightened superiors into springing you and raising your pay. That, at least, is the fine American way in which Stuart Erwin accomplishes his ambition in the film under present discussion. True, it is all a quasi-comedy—sort of a lower-level cross between ""Made For Each Other"" and ""A Slight Case of Murder""—so that makes everything all right. And bits of it are very much all right, in a biting, satiric way. But, frankly, the greater part of it is surprisingly cynical and grim, the forces of law and order are flouted unmercifully and even that old stand-by, the best friend, is made out a terrible heel.

All-American Boy Who May Be a Buddha - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from May 25, 1994, Section C, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Living in pre-Industrial Light and Magic times, the Buddha attained spiritual enlightenment the old-fashioned way: sitting beneath a bodhi tree until he arrived at perfect knowledge. But in Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Little Buddha,"" a rapturous $35 million epic about rejecting worldly excess to embrace simpler values, there is a better way. Or at least a bigger one. And so, as Prince Siddhartha (Keanu Reeves), who will evolve into the Buddha (or Enlightened One) through this experience, is seen beneath the tree during this film's most staggering sequence, all the wonders of the special-effects world are unleashed to convey his visions. If this dazzling mixture of Buddhist thought and cinematic fireworks had been possible a couple of decades ago, it would have prompted the ""Oh, wow"" heard round the world. Even today, in less giddy times, it makes for a gorgeous, grandly presumptuous spectacle that really deserves to be seen.""Little Buddha,"" a crazily mesmerizing pop artifact that ranks alongside Herman Hesse's novel ""Siddhartha"" in terms of extreme earnestness and quasi-religious entertainment value, finds Mr. Bertolucci working in an uncharacteristic vein. For all its obvious seriousness, ""Little Buddha"" has a naive, miracle-gazing intensity that turns it into Mr. Bertolucci's first Spielberg movie, complete with awestruck faces and intimations of higher knowledge. This is also the film maker's first close encounter with visual tricks like morphing, which makes for religious experience of another kind.""Little Buddha"" also has a greater visual sophistication that echoes some of Mr. Bertolucci's own wide-screen exoticism, as captured most recently by ""The Last Emperor"" and ""The Sheltering Sky."" Photographed stunningly by Vittorio Storaro, accompanied by Ryuichi Sakamoto's powerfully insinuating score, this film rises above its own obviousness to work in genuinely mysterious ways. At his best, Mr. Bertolucci can present an image of cars on a highway and still suggest something of the unknown. Once again following his own compass to extraordinarily beautiful places (in Bhutan, in Katmandu and even in Seattle), Mr. Bertolucci tells a two-tiered story. This film's means of approaching the tale of Prince Siddhartha, the young Buddha, is by means of the Conrad family of Seattle and a group of Tibetan monks. Led by Lama Norbu (played with courtly distinction by Ying Ruocheng), the monks seek out the Conrads for a reason. They reveal to Lisa Conrad (Bridget Fonda) and her husband, Dean (Chris Isaak), that they think the couple's 9-year-old son, Jesse (Alex Wiesendanger), is the reincarnation of a Tibetan lama. Lisa and Dean are sufficiently open-minded to take this news in stride. Whenever ""Little Buddha"" explains a basic Buddhist tenet like reincarnation, it takes pains to find some kind of visual correlative. When Jesse is told that meditation can make bad thoughts seem like passing clouds, for instance, he is in an airplane and there are passing clouds outside the window. This didacticism would be more tedious if it were not presented so avidly, and if the other half of ""Little Buddha"" were not so splashy. If movies experienced reincarnation, then the pageantry-filled early scenes of Prince Siddhartha's story probably had an earlier life as ""The Ten Commandments.""Bronzed, painted and bejeweled, with a head covered with luxuriant ringlets, Mr. Reeves is truly a thing of beauty. That's not the same as being a plausible stand-in for one whose teachings have so profoundly influenced life on this planet, but for the purposes of this film, it works. Despite the fact that Mr. Reeves' voice sounds oddly reprocessed, and that he retains traces of surfer-boy body language at the most unexpected moments, he more than commands interest during those sections of the film that depict Siddhartha's evolution. When a huge cobra magically appears to shield Siddhartha from rain, for instance, Mr. Reeves need only sit in meditation and look serene. That he can do. The screenplay, by Mark Peploe and Rudy Wurlitzer from a story by Mr. Bertolucci, is free to take liberties, since so little is actually known about Siddhartha's early life. They fare more successfully in these religious sections than in the ordinary business of understanding the Conrads, despite the airy, affirmative quality both Ms. Fonda and Mr. Isaak bring to the film. And the screenplay also pales when it reveals that two other children are candidates for being the reincarnated lama. Although the word candidate is used, the idea of competition is meaningless to ""Little Buddha,"" since the film strives for such a beatific mood. That attitude is admirable, but it also serves to put a damper on the film's dramatic possibilities. Despite the screenplay's stray anachronisms (Siddhartha uses words like ""ego"" and ""architect""), the writers succeed in giving a storybook tone to much of this material. In fact, an actual storybook is used to ease transitions back to the Siddhartha tale, in a stroke of simplicity that communicates the film's overall sweetness. In this, ""Little Buddha"" displays a deliberate innocence that suits its subject, even if it contrasts so markedly with much of Mr. Bertolucci's moodier, more unsettling work. ""Lama, what's impermanence?"" Jesse asks in one scene. For one example, his teacher could point to ""Little Buddha"" and its untroubled inner peace.""Little Buddha"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity.

Ten years after ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" first scared the daylights out of audiences, Wes Craven returns to his now classic horror premise and takes it to a new dimension. With equal debts to Pirandello and P. T. Barnum, Mr. Craven brings his prize creation, Freddy Krueger, out of the realm of Halloween masks and into the so-called real world. Realism is fundamental to the ""Nightmare"" series. Mr. Craven does not deal chiefly in phantasmagoric demons; he deals in terrifying extensions of everyday experience, the stuff of which true nightmares are made. The Northridge earthquake in California coincidentally occurred during the shooting of ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare,"" and has been cleverly incorporated into this film's strange story. But if that earthquake hadn't happened (far exceeding one prophetic tremor that the film maker had already staged at a cemetery), it could easily have been something Mr. Craven invented.""You know, it's life on the fault line,"" Heather's baby sitter says breezily, when Heather (Heather Langenkamp) thinks she feels an aftershock or two. In this edgy, post-quake atmosphere, Heather feels a premonition that warns her not to leave her young son for the day, which is just the sort of small, believable, nervous-making thought Mr. Craven exploits best. In his films, life on the fault line is a constant state of mind. Although nothing is precisely amiss at the start of this intricate new ""Nightmare,"" the film is loaded with warning signals, like the fake Freddy Krueger hand that flexes its claws unexpectedly and seems to have a mind of its own. The film begins with (and returns to) an image of Heather in the midst of horror-film special effects, including fire and brimstone along with that runaway hand. Who but Mr. Craven would send his heroine to hell and back in pajamas?Ms. Langenkamp, the terrified ingenue of the first ""Elm Street"" (she also appeared in the third one), seems to be playing herself this time. She is addressed by her real name and is seen working as an actress, making a horror film while her husband, Chase (David Newsom), works on special effects. Heather and Chase have a young son, Dylan (Miko Hughes), whose arrival has made Heather worry about some of the films on her resume. Horror is especially disturbing when juxtaposed with Heather's super-wholesome domestic life. Heather has made her break with Freddy Krueger, but he still leaves subliminal scratch marks on her consciousness. Post-earthquake cracks in the wall have a peculiar pattern. Dylan shapes a familiar evil face in his oatmeal. Then there are those bad dreams, with awful intimations of Freddy bleeding seamlessly into Heather's normal thoughts. Mr. Craven, working at a high pitch of anxiety, is not about to make things easier on his audience by indicating where these dreams actually leave off. Bit by bit, Heather finds her loved ones in peril and her life subverted. And as Mr. Craven, her former co-stars and executives from New Line Cinema work their way into this story, Heather is lured back to Elm Street. She even visits New Line's president, Robert Shaye, in an office conveniently devoid of ""Mask"" toys but lined with ""Elm Street"" memorabilia. ""The fans, God bless 'em, they're clamoring for more,"" Mr. Shaye insists. ""I guess evil never dies, right?""Craftily following that thought past its natural limits, Mr. Craven appears on camera to deliver a definitive pronouncement, telling Heather that only by battling Freddy in another Craven film can she put an age-old demon to rest. Within the wisdom and hucksterism of that thought there lies an ingenious storytelling idea, and Mr. Craven spins it into a dizzying web. What's best about ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" is its wicked unpredictability. If Mr. Craven's thinking about good and evil works its way to a peculiar netherworld, his film gets there too. Meanwhile, ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" takes time to contemplate what Mr. Craven's old nightmares have wrought. There is the celebrity of Freddy Krueger, who turns up here on a talk show. (""Love ya, babe! We'll do lunch!"") There is the eerie co-option of Robert (Freddy Krueger) Englund, who supposedly plays himself here but drifts weirdly into Freddy mode during the story. There is the influence of horror on small children, a matter that comes up repeatedly, whether Heather is reading her son ""Hansel and Gretel"" or being lectured by a doctor about her son's welfare. ""I'm sorry,"" says the doctor, ""but I'm convinced those films can tempt an unstable child over the edge.""""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" is Mr. Craven's own best defense against such charges, an ingenious, cathartic exercise in illusion and fear. Its embrace of horror as a creative outlet for the imagination is best expressed by a minor character who turns up in a morgue scene. (But of course.) ""Sometimes,"" he says, ""it's what we don't see that gets us through the night.""Special effects here are sinister and intense, like the tongue that springs out of a telephone, until they boil over somewhere in purgatory. The film's flat-out climactic battle is elaborately staged. But after a lot of subtler menace, it plays as overkill. Ms. Langenkamp, who looks enough like Nancy Kerrigan to have played her in a television movie, is a capable heroine. Mr. Englund should delight his fans by seeming even stranger without Freddyisms than he does with them. Little Miko Hughes, who also develops a Krueger tic or two, is eerily convincing. It's alarming that a 7-year-old should even see this ""Nightmare,"" let alone appear in it.""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes graphic gore and violence, as well as scenes that are frightening in more discreet ways.

"‘Chasing Mavericks,’ by Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted - The New York Times","welcome to California, people! — who back in the day helped shape a legend-to-be: Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston), a boy with a dream and a battered board. What Jay wanted to do was conquer the surf break known as Mavericks, home of killing, crushing, gorgeous monster waves that surge and crash near the coastal city of Half Moon Bay, 30 miles south of San Francisco. To judge from all the big-wave surfing movies, YouTube clips, books, blogs, competitions and dollars now in circulation, he was part of a vanguard. What entices these surfers and looky-loos to Mavericks are waves that become behemoths topping 50 feet, giants that owe their size to long swells, the continental shelf, fault lines, reef beds, storms and shallow water. According to lore, the surf break is named after a German shepherd, Maverick. He would follow the surfers who frequented the area in the early ’60s and, like them, didn’t tackle its biggest waves. That history hovers in “Chasing Mavericks” as the macramé-and-chakra backdrop for a resolutely old-school tale, by turns seductive and cornball, about a master, a young grasshopper and the Way of the Wave. Its hero journey spans seven years and begins in 1987 with Frosty (Gerard Butler, with taciturn appeal) plucking the young Jay (a sweet Cooper Timberline) from the ocean after the boy, who likes to time waves from the shore, accidentally tumbles in. Frosty makes a living in construction, but his identity, his being, is wholly wrapped up in surfing. It’s who he is, to the gentle consternation of his wife, Brenda (Abigail Spencer, looking like a hippie Sarah Silverman). He has children, she reminds him, responsibilities. Ms. Spencer beams brightly in a hackneyed role that’s part saint, part bummer. As his handle suggests, Frosty isn’t the warmest savior, though he melts soon enough, done in by the boy’s yearning. This longing initially revolves around surfing and provides some of the movie’s most appealing scenes, including ones of Jay hurtling into the waves on a board held together with duct tape. Seven years later, and the boy is a teenager slaloming down waves and played by the eager Mr. Weston. (His short blond ’fro and somewhat distressingly happy-vacant stare may induce flashbacks to William Katt and that classic of surfer movies, “Big Wednesday.”) Jay lives to surf, though he also works hard both at a pizzeria and at home, where he tends to his inattentive, often bedridden and depressed mother, Kristy (Elisabeth Shue). She’s a downer, but “Chasing Mavericks” is emphatically upbeat. (It’s a co-production of Walden Media, which is in the inspiration business.) When the movie works, its buoyancy can be infectious and persuasive, particularly in the surfing scenes and in the mesmerizing shots of the heaving, churning ocean and waves. The movie captures the hypnotic quality of this watery landscape, with its steel blue undulations and the Freudian oceanic feeling it summons. It invites you to gaze into this watery abyss, to ponder its mysteries as well as those of the swimmer whose image brackets the movie and evokes John F. Kennedy’s observation: “We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea, whether it is to sail or to watch, we are going back from whence we came.” So, keep your eyes on the waves, just like the watermen in “Chasing Mavericks,” whose numbers include the surfers Greg Long, Peter Mel and Zach Wormhoudt, who show up briefly to lend it authenticity and genuine cool. The surfers and the surfing, along with the natural beauty of the California coastline, help balance the movie’s weak areas, including its lamentably one-dimensional protagonist. (Mr. Apted took over the last 15 days of shooting, after Mr. Hanson left the production for health reasons, which may help explain the movie’s unevenness.) When he isn’t surfing, the fictionalized Jay tends to drag the story down, whether he’s smiling moonily at Frosty, the ocean or one of the women in his life. He nearly sinks a story that the real Jay Moriarity surfed into legend. “Chasing Mavericks” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Children may want to move to California to become surfers.",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/movies/chasing-mavericks-by-curtis-hanson-and-michael-apted.html
"‘Joffrey: Mavericks of American Dance,’ a Documentary - The New York Times","most jarring, perhaps, for a classical ballet company — is “Billboards” (1993), set to the music of Prince. Together they become an important piece of not only the company’s history but also of dance history, explained by interviews with former company members and others there at the time. And the company’s financial troubles — a break with its early benefactor, Rebekah Harkness, and its later move to Chicago — are also covered. Alas, dance films like Wim Wenders’s innovative, kinetic “Pina” have now set a high barre, and by comparison the traditional talking-head style of this documentary seems primed for showings on public television. And while this hagiographic film touches on the lives of the company’s founders, Mr. Joffrey and Gerald Arpino, it doesn’t have time, or ability, to create fully dimensional portraits of these men. That said, I wish a good future for “Joffrey,” the film; the heritage of dance deserves it.",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/movies/joffrey-mavericks-of-american-dance-a-documentary.html

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""YOU always been gutless?"" an ornery poker player snarls across the table at Bret Maverick. Mel Gibson looks thoughtful -- for all the world like Jack Benny pondering ""Your money or your life?"" -- then cheerfully answers, ""Yeah, I guess so."" As the suave but disaster-prone Maverick has cause to say later, ""Being spineless has kept me alive a long time."" It also helps that he's quicker on the draw than most gunslingers, smarter than the average gambler and wears a lucky poker shirt. Fast, funny, full of straight-ahead action and tongue-in-cheek jokes, ""Maverick"" is ""Lethal Weapon"" meets ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" That combination won't win any prizes for originality, but it works like a movie mogul's dream and sets the summer-film season off to an unbeatable start. Heading for a high-stakes poker game on a riverboat, Maverick is a few days away, $3,000 short and trailed by villains hired to keep him out of the game. On the way he hooks up with Jodie Foster as Annabelle Bransford, a semi-efficient con woman, and James Garner, television's original Maverick, as Zane Cooper, a marshal who can teach Maverick a thing or two about spineless survival. As they bumble their way through the Old West, they turn it into the New West of moviedom with their smart contemporary tone. Richard Donner, who directed Mr. Gibson in all three ""Lethal Weapon"" pictures, takes a similar approach here. Just as ""Lethal Weapon"" is an action movie that chuckles at action movies without straining anyone's brain, ""Maverick"" exploits and undermines every western cliche from gunfights to war-whooping Indians to runaway stagecoaches and heroes hanging off cliffs. William Goldman isn't shy about borrowing from his own classic ""Butch Cassidy"" screenplay. No meeting between strangers is quite what it seems in this story, which relies on con after con after con. You don't have to know anything about poker to guess that even away from the table, everyone in ""Maverick"" is bluffing all the time. The stars are wildly comfortable in roles that seem shaped for them. Mr. Gibson, one of our best comic actors, plays Maverick with a gleam in his eye, knowing enough not to take the character too seriously. Though he wears fancy vests and his hat cocked back on his head, Maverick is not always the debonair hero. When the film starts, he is sitting on a horse with a noose around his neck, urging the horse not to move. In a flashback he remembers how he got into this fix, starting with the day he rode into town on a burro looking to scrape together the extra $3,000. Men with names like Pork Chop owe him money, but he's not good at collecting debts. That leads to lines like, ""The widow Pork Chop conned me!"" He is fond of quoting things ""my old pappy used to say,"" though those self-preserving sayings don't help much when he is dragged behind the runaway stagecoach or surrounded by hissing snakes. When Annabelle, a poker player herself, throws herself in Maverick's arms and announces how stunningly attractive he is, maybe she means it and maybe it's a ruse. From Annabelle's tell-tale gestures at the poker table to her fake Southern accent, Ms. Foster keeps us guessing about when the character is putting on an act. She and Maverick are more cohorts than lovers, though there is one notable, frantic tryst between poker games. Mr. Garner, of course, is the father of all Mavericks and the master of the wry, slow take. He also brings to his character a lot of Jim Rockford's dryness. And while his presence adds a warm and generous touch to the movie, as the story develops it becomes clear that his role is not just ceremonial. More than a stable counterpoint to the reckless Maverick, his Coop becomes central to the plot in a couple of unpredictable ways. At almost every turn, ""Maverick"" adds sly comic episodes. Among the most elaborate and entertaining is a sequence in which Graham Greene plays Joseph, a smooth-operating Indian who masquerades as a me-want-wampum type of guy. When Joseph and his tribe, in full war paint, surround Maverick, Annabelle and Coop, it's a good thing Maverick can speak Joseph's Indian dialect. Danny Glover also appears in a small cameo with his ""Lethal Weapon"" partner. And the riverboat gamblers, led by James Coburn, are a portrait gallery of familiar western faces, from Doug McClure of ""The Virginian"" to country singers like Clint Black and Waylon Jennings. The film has an affectionate surprise ending, with the hero in a bubble bath. It's the perfect slippery conclusion for a smart, newfangled ""Maverick.""""Maverick"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some action scenes and some strong language.

"MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE; So Witty, So Sophisticated, So Lonely - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from November 23, 1994, Section C, Page 9Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Famed for their stinging wit and conversational savagery, the wags of the Algonquin Round Table would undoubtedly have had claws out for a drama like ""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,"" Alan Rudolph's name-dropping celebration of their heyday. Surely Dorothy Parker herself, a caustic critic who lacerated even ""The House at Pooh Corner,"" could have had a field day with this film's pretensions, omissions and overweening literary lights. But that would miss the fascination of a film with a charismatic, unforgettable heroine, stunningly well-played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. ""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" has its flaws, but it also has a heartfelt grasp of what set Dorothy Parker apart from her fellow revelers and makes her so emblematic a figure even today. The film lives up to Mr. Rudolph's observation (cited in production notes) that ""the 20's seemed to me the source of many contemporary notions, only with better language.""Since that language is both a bane and a windfall for ""Mrs. Parker,"" it takes getting used to. (So does the acid purr with which Ms. Leigh delivers her lines, imitating a woman whose best bons mots were often muttered under her breath. This actress makes the most of her sodden vocal intonations, whether charming a full panoply of Algonquin walk-ons or gazing at the camera to recite breathtakingly bitter examples of Mrs. Parker's verse.)One of Mr. Rudolph's chief affectations here (in a screenplay written with Randy Sue Coburn) is the use of wall-to-wall quips, many of them famous and all delivered with studied, improbable nonchalance. The cleverness is so incessant that Robert Benchley, played beautifully by Campbell Scott as the true, unavailable love of Dorothy Parker's life, cannot so much as order eggs without asking for them ""loosely scrambled -- like my brains.""Jarring at first, this mannerism becomes useful as it incorporates so much droll dialogue and lively biographical information into the film. Sure, the tone can be too arch and there are assorted howlers (about Harold Ross's new magazine: ""Well, if it's about New York, why not call it The New Yorker""?) And there are major gaps, like the absence of any significant mention of Dorothy Parker's left-wing political passions. But this film crams a remarkable amount of fact and nuance into the telling of its wrenchingly sad story. If Dorothy Parker, whose celebrated brightness dissolved into such a boozy haze, is remembered as a victim, she is also recalled as a smart, tough woman who was the architect of her own destiny. That is why she remains of such enduring interest: as a brilliantly rueful writer whose intellect brought her more acclaim and attention than she could handle, and who wrote scathingly about love and self-loathing, about frivolity forcing talent into decline. This film is trenchant enough to capture both the Mrs. Parker who gazed contemptuously at Mrs. Benchley (Jennifer Beals), dismissing her as a homebody, and the one who longed for romantic and domestic satisfactions she denied herself. Drinking, wisecracking and lavishing love on her dogs became the only ways out. And there came a point at which the waning Algonquin party was emphatically over.""Mrs. Parker"" first finds her in Hollywood, a fading legend thinking back to her glory days. (""I suppose it was -- colorful,"" she says, beginning a flashback that moves the film awkwardly from black and white to color.) Then, younger and more sparkling, she is seen at the end of her marriage to Edwin Parker (Andrew McCarthy), newly returned from World War I with an addiction to morphine and little apparent appreciation of his wife's repartee. ""You don't want to become the town drunk, Eddie,"" she cautions him. ""Not in Manhattan.""Mrs. Parker, whose friends called her that or Dottie, is also seen being forced to leave Vanity Fair for writing scorching reviews, after which her friend Mr. Benchley quits in solidarity. The platonic affection between these two is stirringly captured in a way that makes full sense of what Alexander Woollcott said when someone pointed to Mrs. Parker and asked, ""Would that be Mrs. Benchley?""""Yes, that would be Mrs. Benchley, were it not for the fact that there already is a Mrs. Benchley,"" Woollcott explained.""Mrs. Parker"" fares best with intimate exchanges between these two and well-played figures like Charles MacArthur (Matthew Broderick), whose love affair with Dottie left her brokenhearted, or Alan Campbell (Peter Gallagher), the husband she disparaged but married twice. Much showier and chancier are big scenes packed with caricatured literary figures, who do emblematic things like play croquet or invent the famous Round Table. The cast is huge, uneven, and not always easily recognizable; in the film's more crowded scenes, it takes a keen ear for name-dropping to determine who's who. The screenplay's nonvintage lines can also be clumsy: ""Oh, here's Kaufman -- George!"" ""I'm hungry, aren't you?"" ""No, I'm Mr. Sherwood.""As she confirms here and also showed with her amazing mimickry in ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" Ms. Leigh has lately evolved from a promising young performer to an accomplished actress capable of dazzling surprises. One of this film's best scenes is its very last, in which her aging, distracted Dorothy Parker is asked to deliver her own epitaph. With sudden relish she rises to that occasion, answering: ""What a morbid thing to ask a person! You've just stolen my heart.""Milling on the outskirts of ""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" are actors who often physically resemble their characters and seldom deliver more than a line or two. Lili Taylor's Edna Ferber appears only briefly, but startles the Algonquin sophisticates with her bluntness; Sam Robards is around for a mention of ""the little old lady in Dubuque,"" but does not otherwise suggest Harold Ross; Wallace Shawn (as the hotel maitre d') and Keith Carradine (doing Will Rogers) help to think up the Round Table. Mr. Rudolph lets much of this run on too long, but he doesn't seriously meander. He sustains a sharp idea of where Dorothy Parker fit into this group portrait, and why her brittle fun with the Algonquin's Vicious Circle came to such a lonely end.""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes mild profanity, brief nudity and sexual situations. MRS.

Review/Film: Carlito's Way; The Triumph of Atmosphere Over Detail in Spanish Harlem - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from November 10, 1993, Section C, Page 19Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. When Carlito Brigante gets out of prison in 1975, he returns to Spanish Harlem as a street-smart Mr. Big. This has less to do with Carlito (a vaguely written, not-so-clever character) than it does with casting, since ""Carlito's Way"" brings Al Pacino back to familiar dramatic territory. Playing one more tough, savvy gangster, Mr. Pacino brings vast entertainment value to a film that otherwise would not make great sense. And Brian De Palma finally succeeds in a ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" vein, delivering a droll portrait of the disco years as seen through a bemused, jaundiced eye.""Carlito's Way"" is supposedly fueled by Carlito's dreams, which are to open a car rental business in the Bahamas (really) and resume his romance with Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), the kind of woman who calls him Charlie. But the film's real heart is in the very places Carlito speaks of escaping: the seedy social clubs and slick dance palaces where the story's main action unfolds. In these settings, letting his camera swoop and soar in countless unexpected ways, Mr. De Palma captures the grandiose romanticism of his story without concentrating too heavily on the hard facts. ""Carlito's Way"" is best watched as lively, colorful posturing and as a fine demonstration of this director's bravura visual style. Based on two novels by Justice Edwin Torres of New York State Supreme Court (one of them so steeped in street argot that it includes a glossary), ""Carlito's Way"" also has its gritty side. At times the film's sharply urban look and its vivid minor characters suggest Mr. Pacino's work with Sidney Lumet (""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""Serpico""), but ""Carlito's Way"" turns out to be more overheated than those films were. This one unfolds against a backdrop of such churning decadence that Carlito becomes the one cool head in the story, not its crusading maverick. Indeed, Carlito's main job is to stay out of trouble, trying to defend himself against the new breed of hoodlum, the type that sneeringly brands him ""a used-to-be bad guy.""One of the plot's more dubious contrivances is the idea of Carlito's huge debt to David Kleinfeld, a lawyer who epitomizes the film's wry view of get-rich-quick chic. Look closely at David Kleinfeld: behind the glasses, sideburns, flashy clothes and thinning, frizzy hairdo, Sean Penn remains truly unrecognizable for a while. But Mr. Penn's presence becomes more obvious as Dave gets crazier, thanks to a cocaine habit that the film documents in ominous detail. (Among the film's indelible images is that of Dave in ascot and blazer, awash in bad vibes and new money as he throws a huge, druggy party in his waterfront backyard.) Mr. Penn's strange, jarringly intense performances are infrequent these days, but this one was worth waiting for. Intent on breaking with his criminal past, Carlito has become something of a businessman. A voluptuously grisly shootout early in the film leaves him holding a nest egg, and he pursues his dream of paradise at a nightclub by that name. The club has the look of a garish cruise ship, which somehow fits in with the scheme that will drag Carlito into trouble. The fast-sinking Dave enlists his favorite client in a plot involving an Italian gangster, with a central episode that is meant to take place on water. ""You killed us,"" Carlito tells Dave simply, when the plan goes wrong. Actions eventually have consequences in ""Carlito's Way,"" but the film includes many vivid digressions along the way. Foremost among these is Carlito's romance with Gail, a would-be ballerina and Broadway actress who actually dances in a strip club. Gail is perhaps meant, in David Koepp's screenplay, to be more substantial than the film makes her, but Ms. Miller keeps the character both sexy and shrill. The role is essentially thankless, since no woman (notwithstanding Michelle Pfeiffer's appearance in Mr. De Palma's ""Scarface"") can really compete with the fiery machismo on which ""Carlito's Way"" thrives. Also in ""Carlito's Way"" are a couple of short, searing performances from John Leguizamo as the young tough guy who is Carlito's worst nightmare, and Viggo Mortensen as the desperate, wheelchair-bound hoodlum who also plays into Carlito's self-image. Luis Guzman, cast as another thug, provides sinister proof that Carlito isn't as shrewd as he should be, and James Rebhorn is dryly effective as the District Attorney who won't believe that Carlito has escaped his life of crime. Paul Mazursky appears briefly as the exasperated judge who lets Carlito out of jail. Among the film's sweeping atmospheric touches are a weird, witty soundtrack of disco hits assembled by Jellybean Benitez, and another appearance by a major train station, like the one that figured so prominently in Mr. De Palma's film of ""The Untouchables."" This time, Grand Central Terminal is used as the backdrop for a sustained, thrilling chase that starts out on the subway and ends, for Carlito, in a place that is not simple to describe. Aided by the staccato editing of Bill Pankow and Kristina Boden, and by Stephen H. Burum's dazzlingly supple camerawork, Mr. De Palma ends his film with a sequence Hitchcock might have envied.""Carlito's Way"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold"" centers on a treasure hunt, and there's no mistaking the kind of loot it's after. This sequel has no real purpose beyond the obvious one of following up a hit, although the original film was just as casual at times. Both of them rely on Billy Crystal's breezy, dependably funny screen presence to hold the interest, even when not much around him is up to par. Both also count on the irascible Jack Palance, even though Mr. Palance's Curly was dead and buried when the first film was over. One mark of this sequel's listlessness is that it takes so long to orchestrate Mr. Palance's return, this time in the role of Duke, Curly's twin brother. Twin brother? That's almost as desperate as suggesting the first film's ending was all a dream. But the real problem with the screenplay (by Mr. Crystal with Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel) is that it unfolds so slowly. It takes almost an hour to get Mitch Robbins (Mr. Crystal) away from the New York radio station where he works, and away from some gruesome marital hanky-panky with his wife (Patricia Wettig), who isn't any more fun than she was the first time. These domestic scenes may be intended as loving, but once again Mitch is awfully glad to escape to the Wild West. The film is almost too big-hearted to disparage Mitch's wife, who keeps promising him a red-hot birthday celebration and calls him at the office to describe her plans in graphic detail. However, it does reduce her to nothing but a set of nagging rings on Mitch's cellular phone, which is eventually crushed by a horse. The first ""City Slickers"" was about its characters' midlife crises, which have not exactly abated. Daniel Stern, as Mitch's hapless friend Phil, still makes the most of his crybaby role. Jon Lovitz, in the new role of Mitch's pesty brother, manages to be comparably annoying. But beyond their whining, which was central to the first film's sense of fun, these three tenderfeet also follow a treasure map left behind by Curly and embark on an adventure. Compared with the first film's cattle drive and its homage to ""Red River,"" this idea is, according to Mitch, ""more fun -- and you don't have to watch where you step.""But beyond giving Mr. Crystal chances to do what he calls ""the Walter Huston dance"" (the gleeful jig from ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre""), this story isn't as compelling as the earlier one. The idea of male urban yuppies experiencing their self-doubts in a cowboy setting was at the heart of ""City Slickers,"" and it isn't well used this time. It falls to Mr. Crystal to register the absurdity of the setting in his own distinctive way, as when he looks at one dangerous, unfriendly westerner and says: ""Gays in the military. Your thoughts?"" A little of this would go a long way, but there's not enough of it to go around. Mr. Palance does a nice job of reiterating his earlier, Oscar-winning turn, laughing wickedly at Mr. Crystal and never quite explaining what the one big secret of life might be. His last scene suggests a third ""City Slickers"" in the offing, but by then even this genial second installment has run out of gas. Also notable are Bob Balaban, as a radio talk-show host who will be reduced to being a movie critic if he isn't careful, and Jayne Meadows. She delivers one of the film's few moments of real hilarity when she provides the voice of Mitch's mother wishing him happy birthday.""City Slickers II"" also has animated opening credits, which are cute but slightly creaky in ways that echo the film's overall tone. The credits also recall the first film's cattle-birthing episode, while making viewers glad this isn't a line-by-line copy. At least nobody in ""City Slickers II"" feels precisely the same need to have a cow.""City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes slight sexual suggestiveness and mild profanity.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. On the surface, ""Clean Slate"" is a ""Groundhog Day"" clone, played in reverse. Instead of Bill Murray waking up every morning doomed to repeat the day before, in ""Clean Slate"" Dana Carvey wakes up with no memory of the previous day at all. But the new film is not a slavish copy; it is an amiable movie with its own ambitions, and too many missteps to duplicate the comic sweetness of last year's hit. Mr. Carvey's character leaves a tape recorder by his bed at night. Each morning he turns it on and listens to his own voice remind him that he is a detective named Maurice Pogue. Or as he tells himself, ""You're a small-time gumshoe"" in Venice, Calif. The film has a 1930's or 40's story, and sometimes style, trapped in a 90's comedy. A woman named Sarah Novak (Valeria Golino), dressed in a 40's suit and hat, comes dashing into Pogue's run-down office, saying: ""They're following me. They're trying to kill me."" Soon Pogue learns that Sarah is supposedly dead, and that they are both being hunted by a thug looking for a coin worth $7 million. Mr. Carvey has some genuinely funny moments, most of them when Pogue stumbles into some awkward situation in which it would come in handy to have a memory. He tries to talk his way out of trouble at a surprise birthday party in his honor and while giving important testimony in court. He plays Pogue as a regular guy, and not as a series of broad comic inventions, but it wasn't an inspired idea to create a movie around a character who has no character. Pogue is too much of a cipher to make the romantic plot work. The suspense seems like a flimsy excuse for the comedy, and the deliberate old-movie echoes are abandoned not long into the story. Children may not be annoyed by this mishmash, but adults probably will. Minor characters are played by an overqualified and underused cast that includes James Earl Jones as a district attorney in a neck brace and wheelchair, Michael Gambon as a rich thug in a white suit, Michael Murphy and Kevin Pollak. The film also gets much comic mileage from Pogue's dog, a terrier with a depth perception problem. The dog wears an eye patch that obviously isn't much help, because he keeps aiming for and missing the doorway, the food bowl, his owner's hand. The director, Mick Jackson, handles the film in a low-keyed manner far more reminiscent of his mild ""L. A. Story,"" (written by and starring Steve Martin) than his busy, Kevin Costner-Whitney Houston blockbuster, ""The Bodyguard."" Like ""L. A. Story,"" ""Clean Slate"" is perfectly pleasant to sit through, but always feels as if it's about to become funnier than it is. Something is cockeyed about a movie in which the dog is the most consistently comic character.""Clean Slate"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes a bit of mild language.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""CLIFFHANGER,"" the new high-altitude thriller starring Sylvester Stallone, wastes no time in establishing its first priority, that of sending its audience into a cold sweat. This effect is achieved spectacularly well with a long, death-defying credit sequence set somewhere near the ozone layer. Mr. Stallone, playing a pumped-up Rocky Mountain rescue worker with an incongruously Presidential haircut, does his best to save a young woman who hangs precariously from a rope across a terrifyingly deep abyss. You will be in no hurry to mountain-climb after watching this scene. At such moments, and ""Cliffhanger"" has many of them, thoughts about life insurance come to mind. Was Sylvester Stallone really filmed atop the dizzyingly high, needle-shaped peak that figures prominently in the film's opening? Did he really scale the kinds of cliffs and mountainsides that are seen here? Did he hang in midair from a fraying rope, cross great chasms via rickety bridges or battle over a helicopter about to plunge into oblivion? Obviously, a great deal of credit goes to stunt doubles and optical tricks, but the illusion is still astonishingly effective. ""Cliffhanger"" really seems to be set somewhere up in the sky. Featuring beautiful Alpine vistas (much of ""Cliffhanger"" was shot in Italy, in the Dolomites), this film treats Mr. Stallone as a smaller, more mobile and no less impressive piece of scenery. His muscles bulging, the veins of his neck etched in sharp relief, his jaw set determinedly, Mr. Stallone is every bit as physically impressive as the material requires him to be. As with Steven Seagal, who finally had a big, entertaining film built around him by the makers of ""Under Siege,"" Mr. Stallone has been surrounded by better actors but is unrivaled as his film's main attraction. Main animate attraction, that is. All of the performers are upstaged by the film's breathtaking backdrop, and by the fast and furious way Renny Harlin, the director, approaches action sequences. Just as he did in ""Die Hard 2,"" Mr. Harlin concentrates on generating nonstop excitement at the expense of small talk. In fact, his pacing can be so fast that the occasional transition is missing, though the film's staging remains perfectly clear. Quickly and efficiently, Mr. Harlin leads the film from one perilous escapade to another, following a visceral plot that somehow manages to avoid repetition. Even though ""Cliffhanger"" leads off with a couple of its biggest scenes, a can-you-top-this momentum sustains it all the way through. Dialogue is the only real drawback, since the screenplay by Michael France and Mr. Stallone tends to be as drab as the mountains are beautiful. Mr. Stallone plays Gabe Walker, whose morale is badly injured during that opening rescue attempt and who spends the rest of the film getting it back. In the process, he also loses and re-wins Jessie Deighan (Janine Turner), the plucky mountaineer who is part of his rescue team, and proves his grit to Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), who still bears a grudge against Gabe for the debacle that haunts them both. ""If you don't do this now,"" Jessie tells Gabe, prodding him into action by recalling the trauma, ""you're going to be stuck on that ledge for the rest of your life.""Gabe is forced back into action by a harrowing air crash, which Mr. Harlin stages in typical high-octane style. A plane carrying Treasury Department officials and $100 million in new bills is hijacked in midair, and later goes down in the mountains. When Gabe goes to the rescue, he becomes the captive of a gang led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow), an urbane Englishman who oozes sarcasm from every pore. Mr. Lithgow's suave delivery is rarely matched by the lame repartee that has been written for him (when someone is called a ""piece of work"" in this screenplay, it's pretty obvious what the rejoinder will be). Still, Mr. Lithgow's debonair performance is as refreshing as the snowy panoramas that surround him. Until it takes a turn toward nasty sadism in its later stages -- one character is impaled on an icicle, for instance -- ""Cliffhanger"" remains relatively bloodless and crisp, preferring to concentrate on sheer gamesmanship and clever effects. The sophistication of the latter is one of the film's most enjoyable aspects. Whenever the actors seem to be doing the impossible, it's time to draw back and wonder what was used to help them, but the film works very credibly on its own terms. The special effects seen here are as perfect and hard-won as Mr. Stallone's musculature, and that's saying a lot. Ms. Turner and Mr. Rooker contribute as much spark and variety as is humanly possible, which turns out to be a great deal. The film is also helped by John Vallone's rustic production design on those few occasions when it moves indoors. The rest of the time, Alex Thomson's bright, hard- edged cinematography contributes to the film's rugged atmosphere. Even Trevor Jones's music has muscle.""Cliffhanger"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence and profanity.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. You'd have to visit the planet Remulak to find anyone who really thinks the Coneheads needed to be brought to the big screen. Based on the string of gleefully absurd ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches about a family of queasy extraterrestrials going native in America, ""Coneheads"" is not conspicuous for its wide-ranging wit. Nonetheless, the idea has been stretched out to feature length and propped up with sight gags, ""Saturday Night Live"" cameos and special effects. These visual tricks allow the Coneheads to broaden their horizons in expensive and not-terribly-necessary ways. They are actually seen visiting the planet Remulak, for example. As Hollywood's latest effort to build the Empire State Building out of toothpicks, and as a film squarely aimed at those who found ""Wayne's World"" too demanding, ""Coneheads"" still has its dopey charms. It brings back Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin in the welcome roles of Beldar and Prymaat, a Conehead couple bound by weirdly touching notions of Earthly propriety. Prymaat forms her ideas of wifely behavior by reading women's magazines and looks particularly poignant in head cone, pearls and cardigan sweater. Beldar, who like his wife speaks fluent techno-jargon (""starch disk"" is what they call a pizza), has the darting-eyed, paranoid manner of someone who almost thinks his ruse is a success. These venerable Coneheads (along with Michelle Burke, who now plays their vixenish daughter, Connie) are embroiled in a plot about their escapades in Paramus, N. J. The chief point of the film's meandering screenplay seems to be incorporating as many other ""Saturday Night Live"" players as possible. Many of the current cast members are here, with Chris Farley genuinely funny as the love-struck slob who becomes wildly devoted to Connie after watching her devour a hero sandwich. Adam Sandler appears briefly as a mobster who helps Beldar to assume a new identity and teaches him to say he attended Hobart College. The film's limited intrigue concerns the efforts of an overzealous Immigration and Naturalization Service agent, whom Michael McKean has the good sense to play straight, to apprehend these illegal aliens. ""The United States of America can no longer solve the employment problems of the universe!"" he proclaims grandly, ever the Government bureaucrat, even though he happens to be on Remulak at the time. David Spade has some droll moments as his unctuous aide. Jon Lovitz plays an Earth dentist who is unfazed by Beldar's three rows of teeth. Blink and you will miss the original ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members Garrett Morris and Laraine Newman, neither of whom was given a real role. As directed by Steve Barron (""Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles""), ""Coneheads"" falls flat about as often as it turns funny, and displays more amiability than style. Visually, Mr. Barron has trouble making huge, awkward close-ups of these Coneheads look as enjoyably silly as they did on the smaller screen. The film's best visual conceit comes late, in the form of an old-fashioned movie monster named Garthok who has the jerky movements and constant blinking of a Japanese Cyclops, circa 1958. The idea that simpler and cheaper-looking effects can be more fun does not otherwise seem to have sunk in.""Coneheads"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes profanity from the planet Remulak and brief sexual references.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. In ""Color of Night,"" his first film since the cult success of ""The Stunt Man"" (1980), the director Richard Rush has cast Bruce Willis as a thoughtful, sensitive New York psychologist. This is not so much a casting decision as a throwing down of the gauntlet, an announcement that this film's defiant follies will not be run of the mill. Indeed, the enthusiastically nutty ""Color of Night"" has the single-mindedness of a bad dream, and about as much reliance on everyday logic. Set up as a conventional cat-and-mouse thriller, it plays more like a gleefully demented campfire tale. Mr. Rush, whose eclectic resume also includes ""Getting Straight"" (1970) and ""Freebie and the Bean"" (1974), hasn't come close to making a good movie out of ""Color of Night."" But he does succeed, at times backhandedly, in creating something memorably bizarre. This film's looniness extends right to the bewildering appearance of one of its characters, who is supposed to be in mufti but whose disguise won't fool anyone, anywhere. Is this character's identity supposed to be a mystery? Or are we simply meant to enjoy the joke? Mr. Rush indulged in plenty of gamesmanship in ""The Stunt Man,"" and in that respect he hasn't changed. The difference is that this time his material is more ordinary, and it less reasonably accommodates jokey little extravagances like this.""Color of Night"" begins when Dr. Bill Capa (a very solemn, sometimes bespectacled Mr. Willis) accidentally provokes the suicide of one of his patients, and moves to Los Angeles to forget. The screenplay (by Matthew Chapman and Billy Ray) throws in the dimly Hitchcockian idea that Dr. Capa has become unable to see the color red. Mr. Rush has a more blunt way of emphasizing the trauma: in a bold, De Palma-like shot from below sidewalk level, the camera looks up through a sheet of glass at the victim's body lying in a pool of blood. Later on, locked up symbolically and otherwise, Dr. Capa lives in a house with a doorway resembling a keyhole. Stylistic timidity is not a problem here. But storytelling is, once Dr. Capa arrives in California and helps to oversee the therapy group run by Dr. Bob Moore (Scott Bakula), his old friend. Each of the five patients is a fruitcake, and one of them has threatened Dr. Moore's life.""It'll probably just blow over,"" says Dr. Moore, shortly before he is killed by someone wearing a fingerless chain-mail glove with a built-in dagger at the knuckles. Soon Dr. Capa, who is said to be a veritable ""tuning fork"" when it comes to being sensitive to his patients' personalities, is hot on the trail of the killer. By the time that killer's identity is unveiled, ""Color of Night"" has turned sufficiently home-improvement gothic to equip the villainous party with a nail-shooting gun. And the story's psychological pretensions have truly gone berserk. But the middle of the film keeps busy with the colorful problems of the patients (including Lesley Ann Warren as a beaming nymphomaniac, and a hilariously fussy Brad Dourif as a lawyer). It also dwells on the affair between Dr. Capa and Rose (Jane March), who first meets him by ramming into his car. Cheerfully referring to herself as ""the old fender-bender,"" Rose shows up in a variety of get-ups, like the ruffly apron she wears around his kitchen, sans other clothing. In a more level-headed film, Rose would strike any psychologist as A-plus patient material, but here she manages to pass as reasonably normal. Graphic, acrobatic sex scenes between Mr. Willis and Ms. March (who reveals much the same talent she displayedin ""The Lover"") have much more to do with this film's potential grosses than with its plot. A subdued Mr. Willis appears to be taking ""Color of Night"" very seriously, which is not the best tack. Far more successful is Ruben Blades, giving the film's most flamboyantly funny performance as a police detective who simply blurts out whatever is on his mind. Examining the ornate bed of the late Dr. Moore, Mr. Blades exclaims: ""Everybody's having fun but me!""Also in ""Color of Night,"" appearing briefly and delivering dialogue that's just as wild, is Shirley Knight. ""My husband died last year,"" she says. ""If it makes you feel better, he suffered a lot. Well, anyway, it made me feel better.""""Color of Night"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes gory violence, nudity, profanity and graphic sexual sequences.

In ""Cops and Robbersons,"" Chevy Chase has an unfortunate chance to prove that there's something even more unfunny than his disastrous talk show. In this, a Chase vehicle with four flat tires, he plays a sad-sack suburbanite who secretly yearns to live dangerously, having watched too many police dramas on television. He gets his chance when a surveillance team in his squeaky-clean neighborhood takes over the house next door. Jack Palance, as the policeman in charge of the operation, has the film's only fun when gazing appreciatively at the pitiful Norman Robberson (Mr. Chase). ""He's an idiot,"" Mr. Palance says happily. The film treats him like an idiot, that's for sure. As directed surprisingly lifelessly by Michael Ritchie, the joke-free ""Cops and Robbersons"" condescends miserably to its one-note characters. Dianne Wiest is especially ill-used as Norman's wife, who boasts fatuously about her abilities as a housewife and is so orderly she has posted a household schedule for bathroom time. ""Now we have two that work! We're a normal family again!"" she exclaims, once Jake (Mr. Palance) finds time to fix the Robberson's broken toilet. Fix the toilet? Help out around the house? ""Cops and Robbersons"" goes from bad to worse once Jake changes from glowering sourpuss (Mr. Palance's strong suit) into -- oh, no! -- nice guy. It turns out that Norman and Jake are going to become friends and become better people. Once the Robberson children begin calling Jake ""Uncle Jake,"" you may as well crawl under your seat and close your eyes. Jake is in a Santa Claus suit before the film is over. As for Bernie Somers's screenplay, it includes the following exchange about a hand-rolled cigarette: ""I learned this from an old Rastafarian friend in college."" ""Where was he from?"" ""Oh, Rastafaria."" ""I never been there."" Feeble as that is, it can't match the squirm quotient of the film's embarrassingly bland, supposedly satirical decor. Single worst moment: Mr. Chase's lamely imitating Robert De Niro's ""You talkin' to me?"" riff from ""Taxi Driver.""The best Mr. Chase manages to do here is remind viewers how much funnier he has been playing the same type of character in National Lampoon comedies. The best the film makers can do is concoct a sequence in which two strangers inadvertently share a bathroom and wind up naked in the same shower. Nobody's as stupid as that.""Cops and Robbersons"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes profanity and fleeting nudity.

"Review/Film; A Movie Within a Movie, With a Demure Madonna - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from November 19, 1993, Section C, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. It takes a certain moxie to use Madonna in a film, cast her as a famous actress who casually sleeps with both her director and her leading man, devise a plot in which she is violently slapped around and manage to make her the most demure character in the story. (It takes even more moxie to do this for Maverick, Madonna's own production company, but that's another matter.) But by now Abel Ferrara is well known for having nerve to spare, and for stopping at nothing when it comes to putting his raw, corrosive visions on screen.""Dangerous Game,"" his latest, is a ""Bad Director"" to Mr. Ferrara's previous ""Bad Lieutenant,"" with Harvey Keitel again personifying the film maker's darkest, most mischievous thoughts about the human condition. Those who admired Mr. Keitel's warmly romantic performance in ""The Piano"" had better see ""The Piano"" again for more of the same, since the Mr. Keitel on display here is a far more sodden and primal being. This time he plays Eddie Israel, a passionate film director and not-so-dedicated family man. ""You been a good boy?"" he asks his young son idly. ""Why?""Eddie is first seen in a domesticated state, complimenting his wife on her pasta and listening to classical music. This, by Mr. Ferrara's standards, amounts to a colossal joke. The real Eddie is obsessed with his lurid film about domestic violence, in which a husband hooked on drugs, booze and infidelity (James Russo) attacks his pious wife (Madonna), whom he considers a fraud. Eddie is seen directing from the sidelines, encouraging his actor to do things like urinate on the wall-to-wall carpet in order to show his wife what he thinks of her middle-class hypocrisies.""So it becomes an argument between heaven and hell, if you will, to find what the right path is,"" Eddie comments solemnly about the film being made. That was more true of ""Bad Lieutenant,"" in which Mr. Keitel's corrupt police officer wrestled so agonizingly with his many demons, than it is of ""Dangerous Game,"" a ragged, scorching psychodrama played out in a smaller arena. Besides, Mr. Ferrara, working from a screenplay by Nicholas St. John, his longtime collaborator, appears to see the absurdity in Eddie's grandiose side. So he lets Eddie croon Harry Chapin's ""Taxi"" at a supposedly romantic moment. And he kills off Eddie's unseen father-in-law just so Eddie can be especially awful to his wife on the day of the funeral. Much of ""Dangerous Game"" concentrates on filming the aptly named ""Mother of Mirrors,"" which indeed has a hall-of-mirrors quality. Mr. Ferrara's own presence is strongly felt in scenes showing Eddie charming and browbeating the actors who work for him. Madonna's public image is invoked pointedly as she plays Sarah Jennings, a jaded star with a lot of sway over her fans. Eddie's wife is played forcefully and well by Nancy Ferrara, the film maker's own wife, who can't help adding an extra dimension to the tale. It is she who must chatter away obliviously at a family barbecue while her husband reaches new heights of alienation, stretched out in a lawn chair with all of Los Angeles beckoning in the distance. Mr. Keitel's ability to immerse himself in Mr. Ferrara's stories of self-abasement is once again stunningly complete. It is also given a playful twist by this film's Hollywood context. When a boozy, debauched Eddie gazes at the film being shown aboard an airplane (""The Cutting Edge,"" an uplifting ice-skating fantasy), the sheer disbelief on his face says everything about how Mr. Ferrara perceives mainstream movie making. Yet it's not entirely clear whether he intends ""Mother of Mirrors"" as a viable alternative, given the pulpiness of its action and the sheer viciousness of its escalating violence. Mr. Ferrara retains enough detachment to see that a man as wasted as Eddie may not be working at the peak of his talents, and that when he encourages his actors to improvise, the results may not always be golden. ""I want you to hit the points about the American way of life,"" he instructs his actor, who then simply inserts the word ""consumerism"" into one of his wife-abusing harangues. Whatever else actors do in Mr. Ferrara's films, there's no question that they're given real opportunities to act. And Madonna submits impressively to the emotions raging furiously around her. She cries, whines, pleads and lets herself look dreadful for Eddie's camera. But she becomes a much more nonchalant presence in private moments, like the scene that finds her in bed with her co-star. (Mr. Ferrara saves a particularly mocking surprise for the end of this episode.) The role, which isn't glamorous, is free of artifice in a way that Madonna's screen roles seldom are. Viewers may actually have to remind themselves that they've seen this actress somewhere before.""Dangerous Game,"" which opens today at the Art Greenwich Twin, is not Mr. Ferrara's most daring film (""Bad Lieutenant"" still holds that distinction), but it may be the one that cuts closest to the bone. Shot in a grainy, urgent style with occasional lapses into video, it has a fury that goes well beyond the story at hand, and an energy level that transcends the story's self-indulgence. This tough, abrasive film maker is seldom without his deadly serious side. ""Dangerous Game"" is angry and painful, and the pain feels real.""Dangerous Game"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Leslie Banks in a Fantastic Tale of a Mad Russian Hunter -- Ann Hoarding's New Film. - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from November 21, 1932, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Through the imaginative fashion in which it has been produced, together with its effective staging and a note-worthy performance by Leslie Banks, the fantastic theme of ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" the film feature at the Paramount, makes a highly satisfactory melodrama. It has the much-desired virtue of originality, which, in no small measure, compensates for some of its gruesome ideas and its weird plot. This grim pictorial offering owes its origin to a short story written by Richard Connell. The film had the advantage in its direction of the combined talents of Merian C. Cooper, Ernest B. Schoedsack and Irving Pichel. It is concerned with the strange conduct of a mad Russian, known as Count Zaroff, a big game hunter who is impersonated by Mr. Banks. Zaroff talks rationally, but he happens to have become mentally unhinged through life in the wilds. As he puts it: ""A terrible thought crept like a snake into my mind-hunting was beginning to bore me.""He goes on to explain to Bob Rainsford and Eva Trowbridge, survivors of two different shipwrecks near the small island on which the Count makes his home, that finding no thrill in hunting tigers, leopards or jaguars, he appreciated that he needed a new animal. So he turns to hunting men, letting them loose on his estate, which is no larger than a deer park, with a knife, declared by the madman to be equal to the fangs and claws of wild beasts. He is in the habit of giving his quarry time enough to hide and then starting out with his bow and arrow. He may use a high-powered rifle if the fancy strikes him, and in the event that his man succeeds in avoiding him for a certain number of hours he gives the hunted one his freedom. Another point in this Count's favor is that while he delights in killing the male, he never injures the female, preferring to capture the latter alive. Mr. Banks makes this strange Count really interesting. In fact his portrayal is so good that both Joel McCrea and Fay Wray, who impersonate respectively Rainsford and Miss Trowbridge, are quite over-shadowed. They depend merely on their youth, agility and good looks to elicit sympathy. Miss Wray and Mr. McCrea seem to be far too cheerful during many of the exciting incidents. Mr. McCrea as Rainsford is the sole survivor of a wreck. Yet Rainsford looks as if all that was bothering him as he enters the Count's home was getting some food. Subsequently there is a reason for Rainsford's composure, for he is adjured by Zaroff to assume an ease he does not feel so as not to perturb Miss Trowbridge. Zaroff when giving a start to Rainsford and Miss Trowbridge warns Rainsford against ""fog hollow,"" where they might be even more easily caught than in other sections of the wooded island. The sequences dealing with the mad Nimrod's hunt are set forth in a peculiarly impressive fashion. M. Chevalier Stays On. In the stage revue, ""Paris on Parade,"" which was held over from last week, Maurice Chevalier sings ""Valentine,"" his old French success, and ""Mimi,"" one of the numbers in the film ""Love Me, Tonight.""Rubinoff conducts the orchestra in the playing of ""Ziegfeld Memories."" The hawk-eyed juggler, the dancing girls and others help in the smart entertainment. THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, based on a story by Richard Connell; directed by Ernest B.

‘The Rental’ Review: High Infidelity - The New York Times,"the smug alpha male, the messed-up loser, the outsider and the innocent — settle in for some drinking, drugging and hot-tubbing. Charlie (Dan Stevens), a successful tech entrepreneur, enjoys needling his underachieving brother, Josh (Jeremy Allen White), who worries that his girlfriend, Mina (Sheila Vand), is too smart for him. Bright and bold, Mina is Charlie’s business partner and secret crush; she’s also the only interesting character onscreen. Unforgivably, Franco (who wrote the screenplay with Joe Swanberg) saves the most clueless role (of Charlie’s blandly pleasant wife, Michelle), for his own wife, the marvelous Alison Brie. Only when Michelle is tucked up in bed does the fun begin as Mina and Charlie discover that their Ecstasy-fueled knee-trembler might have been filmed. Suspect number one is the property manager (a subtly sinister Toby Huss), whom Mina has already accused of having a racist reaction to her Middle Eastern heritage. Yet it’s clear that this foursome was doomed to implode even absent the threats of a location cloaked in mist and a plot soaked in voyeurism — one that leaves the door propped wide open for a sequel. Whether anyone will care to walk through it is another matter. The RentalRated R for shower sex and shoreside body disposal. Running time: 1 hour 28 minutes.

‘My Spy’ Review: A Secret Agent Gets Outsmarted - The New York Times,"In the kind of movie “My Spy” is, comedy is derived from fish-out-of-water scenarios. The flailing fish here is the burly, physically adept C. I. A. field agent JJ (Dave Bautista), who is demoted and left gallivanting around the schoolyard with the 9-year-old girl, Sophie (Chloe Coleman). The plan is to nab Sophie’s nefarious uncle, Marquez (Greg Bryk), who is on the brink of selling nuclear weapons plans to another terrorist. There are pratfalls and dodge ball along the way. The film, streaming on Amazon Prime and directed by Peter Segal, seems like a missed opportunity for much of its running time. A better movie would have taken its familiar premise, of a nearly-incompetent spy who’s shown how to get the job done by his prepubescent pal, and leaned into it. “My Spy” could have used its espionage elements to channel a contemporary genre take on “Paper Moon,” with Coleman as a spiritual relative of Tatum O’Neal. An amusing montage shows how effective Coleman is at punching above her weight class. But Bautista, rather charmless, is no Ryan O’Neal. Instead, “My Spy” meanders, uncertain of its audience: It has too much violence and language for family viewing, but doesn’t commit enough to the danger of spy thrillers to stir the Bond and Bourne lovers among us. In the end, it doesn’t know which mission it chooses to accept. My SpyRated PG-13 for violence and language. Running time: 1 hour 39 minutes. Watch on Amazon Prime Video.",http://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/movies/my-spy-review.html
‘Bloodshot’ Review: Shoot to Kill? Good Luck With That. - The New York Times,"this may not be the technical term — Wi-Fi-enabled, meaning he can instantly download and digest a piloting manual, just like in “The Matrix.” So what vulnerabilities does Ray have? The movie, based on a comic by the independent publisher Valiant Entertainment, has fun posing that question, as well as upending its own clichés, in ways that make it prone to spoilers. Ray awakes from his retrofitting with amnesia, but one memory comes back: He saw his wife executed while her murderer played “Psycho Killer” in the background. Diesel strikes the right balance of contemplation and meatheadedness, and Guy Pearce brings more conviction than is necessary to the role of a scientist who crows about how Ray is his “billion-dollar prototype.” Of the Pearce character’s other cyborgs — again, maybe not the technical term — K. T. (Eiza González) is the only one of remote interest. “Bloodshot” runs out of meta tricks before it is over, and David S. F. Wilson, who borrows his visual vocabulary from Tony Scott and Michael Bay, delivers action sequences with such choppy continuity that viewers may be as confused as Ray. He deserves bonus points, however, for embracing silliness: One car crash involves a truck filled with flour. BloodshotRated PG-13. Self-reversing body blows. Running time: 1 hour 49 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/movies/bloodshot-review.html
‘Stuber’ Review: There’s an App for That (Riding With the Law) - The New York Times,"with somewhat diversified casting, as here — the focus on the preservation (veneration) of heterosexual male intimacy remains constant. That’s the case in “Stuber,” which centers on Stu (Kumail Nanjiani), a sweetly beleaguered Los Angeles Uber driver with an aspirational “FIVESTAR” vanity plate. One day, he picks up Vic (Dave Bautista), a police detective who, on the same day that he’s had eye surgery, gets a tip on a killer (Iko Uwais). Since Vic can’t drive, he summons an Uber, thus initiating the latest high-concept duet. Written by Tripper Clancy and directed by Michael Dowse, “Stuber” squeaks by on the charm of its two male stars, who handle the nonsense capably. Bautista steam-rolls through both the frame and the dialogue, but he’s a natural, magnetic physical presence — a nimble hulk — and fun to watch. He’s comfortable sharing the screen with, and being routinely upstaged by, Nanjiani, who’s more adept at making the cheap goods feel less insultingly formulaic. With sidelong looks, leaping eyebrows and unpredictable line readings that invariably personalize the material (he’s as breathy as Marilyn Monroe), Nanjiani transforms a cliché into something resembling a person. The story is as ridiculous as the setup and largely involves Vic and Stu learning how to care and share while chasing down the killer as their strained meet-cute mellows into a full-blown homosocial love-in. Amid the gunfire, spilled blood and cutesy macho posturing there are predictable turns, adorable pups, ethnic stereotypes and a few class-conscious touches (Vic’s apartment, Stu’s main gig). Also notable are the various women who embody challenges that the men must surmount together: Stu’s often-teasing, cruelly elusive crush (Betty Gilpin); Vic’s warmly loving artist daughter (the appealing Natalie Morales); and Vic’s hard-charging boss (Mira Sorvino). There’s another woman in the mix, too, a murdered cop (Karen Gillan), who dies soon after “Stuber” opens. She isn’t around long enough to really register, but her end is ugly, repellent in its unthinking lack of gravity and in its narrative functionality. The death jolts the movie, giving it instantly recognizable stakes; more specifically, it gives Vic something interesting, a tragedy that becomes his principal purpose. In death, she enriches his life, and that’s what makes her a character. Just as important, the dead cop — like every other significant woman in “Stuber” — serves as a test for our two heroes, a hurdle they must clear in order to find themselves, or, rather, each other. StuberRated R for extreme gun violence and the usual bloody action-movie violence. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/movies/stuber-review.html

Review: ‘Blindspotting’ Walks a Tense Line in a Gentrifying Oakland - The New York Times,"young, white, start-up-happy, new-money types — seem eager to embrace the area’s “authenticity,” as long as their interactions with its longtime residents don’t involve any real discomfort. Collin (Daveed Diggs), nearing the end of his probation for a felony we don’t learn much about until relatively late in the movie, initially confronts the “new” Oakland via a bottle of green juice now being sold at his regular bodega. It goes for 10 bucks a pop. Feeling flush on his way to his job at a moving company, he picks one up — partly to impress Val (Janina Gavankar), his ex-girlfriend, who works as the moving company’s receptionist and scheduler. “It’s part of my regimen now,” he tells her, unconvincingly. (He takes one sip and looks as if he’s about to be sick.)Looking good to Val is one of Collin’s many concerns. Anticipating getting sprung from a halfway house, he’s maintaining regular work hours and keeping his nose clean. His friends aren’t, it seems, completely dedicated to his cause. Collin’s best buddy from childhood and partner at the moving company gig is Miles (Rafael Casal). He’s white, while Collin is black. They sometimes like to recap their days and evenings by concocting rhymes together; this element of their friendship comes into crucial play at the movie’s nerve-grinding climax. Miles, despite having a child by the girlfriend with whom he lives, seems more devoted to being “street” than Collin is — he even wears a grill in his mouth — and when Miles illegally purchases a gun from a mutual friend for “house protection,” you just know that nothing good is going to come of it. But the movie’s first occasion of gunfire comes from the police. Driving home one evening, nervous about making his 11 p.m. curfew, Collin witnesses a white cop shooting an unarmed black man. Near paralyzed at the sight, he’s ordered to move along — but not before locking eyes with the officer (Ethan Embry). The shooting makes the local television news, distorted from the reality of what Collin saw. One night while hanging out with Val, who’s studying psychology, Collin notices in her textbook an illustration called “Rubin’s Vase,” a set of two-dimensional forms that appear to be a vase or two human profiles depending on your perception of it. The changing social sets in Oakland are, in this movie, creating not just ambiguity but distortion. And as Collin approaches the end of his probation, he seems to gain clarity with respect to the victims of police brutality. They begin to haunt him even as he fails to see the immediate ways he’s putting his own life in danger. This movie, which was written by Mr. Diggs and Mr. Casal, has an energetic-to-the-point-of-boisterous style. Its lively frequency is embedded in the writing, bolstered by Carlos López Estrada’s direction, and kept buoyant by the performers. This particular aspect of the film makes it exciting to watch, but can also be confounding. “Blindspotting” often seems as if it wants to split the difference between its social concerns and its engagement level as an entertainment. The schematic nature of the movie’s story line and the on-the-nose quality of many of its observations can add to the frustration. My first impression was that “Blindspotting” worked best as a suspense narrative, with its countdown structure, ticking off the days before Collin’s probation ends. Collin is so appealingly portrayed by Mr. Diggs — a 2016 Tony winner for “Hamilton” — that you want him to be O. K. Indeed, the movie’s ultimate compassion is such that it makes you want everyone to be O. K., including Miles, who often just behaves like a straight-up knucklehead. But whatever my quibbles, the actual core of the movie is so pertinent that I’ve continued to think about it, hard, since I first saw it. (The same is true of another new, Oakland-set movie about race and American society, the outrageously affecting “Sorry to Bother You.”) What I took to be tonal inconsistency may actually be a form of dialectic. I unabashedly admire the movie’s aims, and think “Blindspotting” ought to be seen by the widest audience possible.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/movies/blindspotting-review-daveed-diggs.html
Review: ‘Dark Meridian’ Is a Crime Thriller Starring New Orleans - The New York Times,"an attempt to make a storage tank of lemonade from one lemon. The story begins when Spencer (James Moses Black), a cop in league with a local gangster, confronts one of the gangster’s sons, Tevi (Dave Davis), outside the warehouse that he’s staking out — minutes before a blood bath inside that leaves only one survivor. Quentin Tarantino-style flashbacks illuminate what happened. Inside the warehouse, Tevi and his father’s henchmen had been avenging the killing of Tevi’s brother. But Tevi, untrusting of the rival gangsters who delivered the ostensible murderer (Billy Slaughter), wasn’t sure they had the right guy. In the present time frame, Tevi, the smart son who could have avoided a life of crime, and the avuncular Spencer team up track down the wounded man who escaped the scene. Mr. Hickman clearly knows New Orleans and has branched out beyond obvious locations, making the city a central presence. The acting, on the other hand, might best be described as uneven, and a hollow finale mutes whatever impact the movie might have had as a character study. “Dark Meridian” proves that Mr. Hickman has the capacity to surprise, but it doesn’t prove much more.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/movies/dark-meridian-review-new-orleans.html
"Review: In ‘The Disaster Artist,’ How to Fail at Moviemaking - The New York Times","particularly the inhibited Greg — by turning up the volume on Stanley Kowalski while thrashing about as if demonically possessed. An odd, inexplicable friendship begins, and before long Greg and Tommy are driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, where much of the story takes place. Shacked up in Tommy’s apartment, the two men try and fail to break into the entertainment business, though Greg manages to sign with a talent agency. Hope fades, as it does, amid the sunshine and smiles, and this movie slips into idle. Tommy continues to prove his lack of talent in a very funny and terrible audition; Greg finds romance with a bartender, Amber (Alison Brie). At last, inspired by Greg, Tommy — who has mysteriously deep pockets that never seem to empty — decides to direct and star in his own movie, with Greg as backup. It’s a personal vision that eventually spirals into a mutual hallucination. James Franco, who also directed “The Disaster Artist,” swoops through the movie like a star, one who has no idea that he never achieved liftoff. His face framed by a dramatic curtain of inky black hair and noticeably if discreetly modified by prosthetics, Mr. Franco certainly looks the part and sounds it too, having perfectly captured Mr. Wiseau’s puzzling accent and arrhythmic intonation. Yet even at its most convincing, Mr. Franco’s performance retains an interior lightness, a playfulness, including when Tommy goes emotionally dark. Mr. Franco isn’t making fun of his character, at least not entirely; rather, he’s put distance into the mix, as if to point out that Tommy is very much a self-made man, a construction. The making of “The Room” gives “The Disaster Artist” its point and much of its broad comedy. Filmmakers love making movies about movies, and Mr. Franco is no exception. (He mined similarly reflexive terrain in the very dissimilar “Interior. Leather Bar.,” an experimental feature that he directed with Travis Mathews about the making and remaking of “Cruising.”) Mr. Franco recreates the production of “The Room” — and the escalating behind-the-scenes nuttiness — with an assured, energetic touch, some fitting burlesque and an appealing cast that includes Jacki Weaver and Seth Rogen, who gives his deadpan a workout to play Tommy’s put-upon script supervisor. Written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, “The Disaster Artist” is a straighter, more obviously commercial-minded project than some of the other movies that Mr. Franco has directed. It’s a divertingly funny movie, but its breeziness can also feel overstated, at times glib and a bit of a dodge. In “The Room,” Mr. Wiseau comes across as somewhat menacing, with an underlying intensity that can’t be entirely laughed away. (That’s part of what makes the unwatchable almost watchable.) Mr. Franco’s performance keeps you hooked, in large degree because of its entertaining visual spectacle. Tommy’s wardrobe, for one, suggests a commitment to the 1980s and a familiarity with the defunct catalog International Male, a source for padded briefs and Jack Sparrow frippery. Yet if Mr. Wiseau is a bona fide eccentric, he proves to be not an especially interesting one in this incarnation. The filmmakers try to complicate Tommy, including with some self-referential layering that never meaningfully develops. At one point early on, Greg and Tommy visit the site where James Dean died, a pilgrimage that at once nods to Mr. Franco’s breakthrough role as Dean and telegraphs one of the more ludicrous scenes in “The Room.” Dean becomes Greg and Tommy’s inspiration, a success story that they invoke while struggling to make it. But there’s no sense that either remotely grasps Dean’s art, which might have made their failure and “The Disaster Artist” more resonant. Mr. Wiseau has made the most of his 15 minutes, which have already been generously extended by “The Disaster Artist.” His website for “The Room” suggests that he’s a busy man. It lists where and how you can see the film, sometimes with him in attendance. In the synergistic spirit of Disney (but with lavish misspellings), the website also features a line of tie-in products like “Room”-themed watches, backpacks, jackets and men’s briefs emblazoned with Mr. Wiseau’s name on the waistband. It’s funny and somewhat depressing, which also pretty much sums up the “The Room,” one of those cultish attractions that is so terrible it makes you wonder if the laugh finally is on us.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/movies/the-disaster-artist-review-ames-franco-tommy-wiseau.html
"Review: In ‘Wait for Your Laugh’ and ‘Gilbert,’ Comedians Work Hard - The New York Times","and Dan Harmon, the creator of “Community,” displays an insightful critic’s eye — but the heart of this movie is Rose Marie talking you through her own life with the same attention to pleasing the audience as she shows onstage. Her steely good cheer is good company as she relates taut, action-packed stories about run-ins with Al Capone and Jimmy Durante with a minimum of introspection. Jason Wise’s documentary, which relies on re-enactments and backstage footage with sparing use of performances, is a love letter to the performer but not the business, in which she managed to achieve a measure of fame for nine decades, while still being overlooked. Her single-minded focus on work is presented as admirable but also something of a curse. As in the documentary “Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,” this is a movie about a star never at peace unless she’s performing, a contrast with “Gilbert,” another compelling, surprisingly moving documentary about an eccentric with an old-school work ethic. The stand-up comic Gilbert Gottfried has built a highly respected career telling profane, even shocking jokes in a sandpaper voice. The director Neil Berkeley nicely sketches his career with an emphasis on controversial comedy. (“I have a flight to California,” he said at a roast weeks after Sept. 11. “I can’t get a direct flight. They said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first.”)What distinguishes this documentary is the incongruity between the raucousness of the humor and the quiet, mundane rituals of his domestic life, whether puttering around his New York apartment or in more joyous scenes with his two children and wife, Dara Gottfried. As an unlikely love story, this movie excels, presenting a relationship so affectionate and warm that it overwhelms the jokes. When he curses at his wife, she takes it as a sweet nothing. And when she cracks a joke, he’s quick with a booming laugh. “Gilbert” is that rarest of things, a portrait of a happy comic.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/wait-for-your-laugh-review-gilbert-gottfried-rose-marie.html

Review: A Civil War Erupts in ‘Bushwick’ - The New York Times,"moving north over Brooklyn from Coney Island — that turns out to be the view from a helicopter gunship. The city is under attack, invaded not by a foreign or extraterrestrial army but by forces of secession from the southern United States. A young woman named Lucy (Brittany Snow), on her way to visit her grandmother, finds herself caught up in a new civil war. This is not a bad premise. The idea that regional and ideological divisions might erupt into violent conflict doesn’t seem entirely far-fetched these days, and low-budget genre movies can often generate more political insight than their prestige-minded Hollywood cousins. But while “Bushwick,” directed by Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott from a script by Nick Damici and Graham Reznick, offers reasonable technical competence — following shots that are as fluid and kinetic as expert video-game play — its storytelling is dimwitted and amateurish. Fleeing black-uniformed snipers and storm troopers, as well as opportunistic street criminals, Lucy teams up with a burly janitor named Stupe (Dave Bautista), and they zigzag through the neighborhood that gives the movie its title. The name once signified a working-class black and Latino part of New York, but lately it has become synonymous with the artisanal, post-collegiate culture of 21st-century Brooklyn. The filmmakers feign boldness in tackling national politics, but revert to coyness and caricature when it comes to local matters, gesturing toward a multiculturalism that isn’t even skin deep and sweeping gentrification under the rug. The civil war “Bushwick” imagines is mostly about white people, which kind of makes the movie a piece of historical revisionism about something that hasn’t even happened yet.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/movies/bushwick-review-brittany-snow-dave-bautista.html
Review: Cosplay and Comedy in ‘Brigsby Bear’ - The New York Times,"a familiar plight for many superfans. The obsession in question is “Brigsby Bear,” an amusingly weird live-action children’s television show that James (Kyle Mooney) has been faithfully watching since childhood. Now somewhere in his 20s, James shows no sign of moving on. He doesn’t merely love the plucky, heroic bear — as well as Brigsby’s adorable helpers, the Smiles Sisters, and his villainous foe, the Sun Snatcher; James has absorbed the show, its stories and ethos into his being. His walls are lined with images from it; his shelves are crammed with recordings of each episode and related paraphernalia. He can mouth old dialogue verbatim. He even sleeps on “Brigsby” sheets, as if tucking into his own fanboy nest. If this sounds familiar, it’s no wonder. Who, after all, hasn’t taped a Marilyn Monroe poster on her college-dorm door or hung a really nice poster for the film “Anatomy of a Murder” on a wall? People have been surrounding themselves with objects of worship since time immemorial, even if today’s fetish is more likely to be a Chewbacca collectible than a terra-cotta object. Sure, in the age of global corporate media and cross-platform branding, fandom is a cradle-to-grave commodity lifestyle, from “Star Wars” onesies to superhero coffins. And, yes, this isn’t always cosplay; it’s a matter of life (and death). That’s partly what “Brigsby Bear” is about, though mostly it’s a sweet and sometimes delightful melancholic story of a lonely man saved by imagination and love. That sounds like a bushel of cornball and might have devolved into pure ick if the director, Dave McCary, didn’t lead from the heart and wasn’t adept at navigating seemingly clashing tones. He hooks you early with an uneasily ha-ha, strange opener in which James and two others — Jane Adams plays April while a warm, wonderful Mark Hamill plays Ted — engage in “Brigsby” banter. Soon, sirens are flashing and the movie darkens; a few beats later, it brightens, then swerves into silliness only to veer into seriousness. Much of what follows involves James’s confusing, awkward reintroduction into the world, or what some call adulthood. There’s the family he’s never met (Matt Walsh, Michaela Watkins, Ryan Simpkins); a friendly cop (Greg Kinnear); and a clueless therapist (Claire Danes). There are new buddies (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.), who with smiles, mood enhancers and some unpersuasive narrative nudging help usher James into the here and now. Yet James, having been cut off from Brigsby World, can’t quit the bear, who’s seen every so often saving the day in some of the wittily conceptualized, visually degraded television clips sprinkled throughout the movie. And, really, why should James turn off the love?Mr. Mooney, currently cutting it up on “Saturday Night Live,” manages the twists and tonal fluctuations in “Brigsby Bear” beautifully. (He wrote the story and shares screenwriting credit with Kevin Costello.) It’s no surprise that he can sustain and complicate a deadpan. But what makes the character work is the unconditional emotional seriousness that shapes the performance, deepening each glance and gesture. Mr. McCary fills the movie with modest comic jolts, from James’s shock of hair to the near-Lynchian cardboard surrealism of the “Brigsby” show. The biggest jolt, though, is how each laugh brings forth more feeling in a movie that flirts with tragedy but opts for joy.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/movies/brigsby-bear-review-kyle-mooney.html

But they later burst into tears when they hear how they and their families have been presented in materials to donor groups — put, as one says, in “the wrong light.” Even so, perhaps the families are denying the truth out of shame. The rest of the film tries to determine the facts, though questions remain.

"Review: In ‘The Little Hours,’ These Sisters Are Neither Chaste Nor Obedient - The New York Times","seasoned with a sprinkling of Monty Python — the writer and director, Jeff Baena, turns an Italian convent into a hotbed of repressed desires. Boccaccio might have had medieval audiences rolling in the aisles, but Mr. Baena squanders an R rating and a roster of household names while managing to raise little more than a smile. At times, the atmosphere is so clubby that the actors seem to be performing mainly for one another. Centering on three irreverent nuns played by Aubrey Plaza (witchy and bitchy), Alison Brie (frustrated and snooty) and Kate Micucci (bi-curious and babyish), the goofy plot never finds its groove. Molly Shannon, in the role of senior sister, is virtually ignored; and Dave Franco’s hunky handyman is mostly just a ripped body for female characters to enthusiastically molest. Lushly shot in northwest Tuscany by the cinematographer Quyen Tran, “The Little Hours” is saved from ignominy by two brief standout performances. Fred Armisen’s monologue as a scandalized bishop is priceless; but it’s the fabulous Lauren Weedman (who injected warmth and pathos into the thankless role of a gay man’s best friend on the regrettably short-lived HBO show “Looking”) who rises above her one-note character. As a lust-filled lady whose lord leaves her cold, Ms. Weedman sucks every syllable dry. It’s too bad she doesn’t have more of them.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/movies/the-little-hours-review.html
"Review: ‘Dying Laughing,’ About Bombing Onstage, or, Conversely, Killing - The New York Times","it’s magic.” He describes his first impression of a comedy club audience as “a dead-silent room of unhappy people.”“Dying Laughing” changes topics every few minutes. But one of the longer sections is devoted to life on the road, with its terrible food, miserable lodgings, deadly boredom, loneliness and hostile audiences. In a segment dealing with hecklers, Sarah Silverman good-humoredly recalls hearing someone in the back of a club letting out a light whistle as if a bomb were dropping. Pared down, this overcrowded movie could be a teaching tool in a comedy school. But as one comic after another recalls triumphs, misadventures and painful lessons learned, the stories become redundant. Garry Shandling, who died last year, and to whom the movie is dedicated, may have the most sage advice. He calls stand-up comedy a “calling,” which he warns “is too painful and difficult” for anyone to pursue casually.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/movies/review-dying-laughing-about-bombing-onstage-or-conversely-killing.html
"Review: ‘Vince Giordano,’ a Nostalgist With Fresh Takes on Jazz - The New York Times","As you absorb the buoyant ’20s and ’30s jazz bubbling through the documentary “Vince Giordano: There’s a Future in the Past,” you may well wonder if this is the happiest American music ever created. It’s a peppy, carefree sound that conveys a frantic energy but is rendered with a light touch. Born and based in Brooklyn, Mr. Giordano, 64, has been leading the Nighthawks, his 11-piece band specializing in the pre-swing era, for nearly four decades. He plays several instruments, including tuba, string bass and bass saxophone, and sings in a voice that evokes a less rambunctious Fats Waller. His popularity playing hotels has spawned a subculture of young fans who flock to his performances in period dress. You probably know the music of this passionate preservationist, which has been featured in Woody Allen’s movies and the HBO series “Boardwalk Empire.” His devotion to stylistic authenticity infuses his band’s performances to the degree that, to quote a ’70s pop song title, “everything old is new again.” Played with such vigor and attention to detail, it sounds utterly fresh. Much of the space in Mr. Giordano’s Brooklyn apartment is devoted to his ever-growing, meticulously annotated collection of 60,000 big-band arrangements. They are culled from his extensive search for original manuscripts and radio transcriptions of music that the film calls hot jazz. What the singer, pianist and cabaret performer Michael Feinstein is to vintage popular songs, Mr. Giordano is to hot jazz. “There’s a Future in the Past” is a ground-level exploration of this historian at work, leading the Nighthawks or one of their satellite ensembles and traveling the country to examine and rescue old arrangements that have turned up in radio station archives and musicians’ basements. What others would dismiss as trash is the equivalent of discovering gold to Mr. Giordano. This movie, directed and produced by Dave Davidson and Amber Edwards, digs deeply enough into Mr. Giordano’s world to convey the drudgery and headaches of being a bandleader: juggling personnel, scheduling, dealing with a musicians’ union and lugging around instruments. But for all the players’ expertise and devotion, their profession won’t make them rich and famous. They do it for love. The most memorable performances are carried by a mysterious lilt that makes them the next best thing to dancing on air.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/movies/vince-giordano-theres-a-future-in-the-past-review.html
"Review: ‘I, Daniel Blake,’ Stuck on the Bureaucratic Hamster Wheel - The New York Times","from the comedian Dave Johns, who portrays Daniel, down to the tiniest role — are so fine-tuned that you often feel you are watching a Frederick Wiseman documentary. While viewing “I, Daniel Blake,” it’s easy to forget that Mr. Loach is a polemicist who has always stood up for working-class Britons, whom his films portray as oppressed, mistreated and noble. He and his longtime screenwriting partner, Paul Laverty, are masters of a dour, clinical neorealism that conveys their feisty resilience in a conservative climate in which struggling workers are demonized as little better than parasitic social refuse. You may applaud when Daniel finally confronts the government workers in person, but the experience is actually more humiliating than dealing with them by telephone. When one sympathetic social worker gives him an extra moment of time, she is sharply reprimanded by her superior. Interviewed face to face, the poor and indigent are interrogated like naughty school children. If they raise their voices in protest, security guards appear to remove them. For Daniel, a skillful woodworker, the seemingly insurmountable obstacle in his quest is his complete ignorance of computers. It makes it impossible for him to create an acceptable résumé, which he is required to post online. The digital divide looms as a personal catastrophe as you watch him being shown the basics but finding himself stymied by every small misstep. What makes the pain of this film bearable is Daniel’s unquenchable decency, courage and perseverance: Mr. Johns, who bears a striking resemblance to the musician Phil Collins, portrays him as a genuine working-class hero with a deep streak of kindness and generosity, a besieged Everyman who reacts to injustice and humiliation with fuming indignation. He refuses to surrender to despair. Is he too good to be true? Probably. At the welfare office, he observes a young woman, Katie (Hayley Squires), and her two children being turned away after arriving a few minutes late for an appointment because she took the wrong bus. Daniel takes it upon himself to be her defender, and for his pains is ousted along with Katie and her children. Katie, we learn, was evicted from her London apartment after filing a complaint. Daniel soon becomes her protector, a creative Mr. Fix-It who makes her crumbling apartment a little less shabby, and a sort of surrogate father to her children. (Fortunately, the movie doesn’t take the Hollywood route of suggesting any romantic connection between the two.) In her quiet way, Katie is as heroic as Daniel. She goes without food to feed her children, is caught shoplifting groceries and in a moment of desperation at a food bank, tears the lid off a can of beans and pours the syrup into her mouth. “I, Daniel Blake” builds up an oppressively claustrophobic atmosphere of mounting dread, and you wonder if the stresses of Daniel’s circumstances will catch up with him in his weakened state. The movie eventually goes a little too far, and makes Daniel’s predicament a popular rallying cry on the street. It’s a showy feel-good moment in an otherwise feel-bad film.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/movies/i-daniel-blake-review-ken-loach.html
"Review: In ‘Kickboxer: Vengeance,’ Duty Calls for an Unpracticed Fighter - The New York Times","a reboot of a foot-fighting franchise from the 1980s and ’90s — follows a tiresome martial-arts movie formula. But amid the hoary conventions are agreeable inklings of an alternate sensibility. When Eric Sloan (Darren Shahlavi), an expert in the savate and Muay Thai fighting styles, accepts an invitation from a shady promoter (Gina Carano, a former mixed-martial-arts champion) to compete in Thailand for a huge purse, his brother, Kurt (the fresh-faced newcomer Alain Moussi), is skeptical. And, yes, Eric meets his maker in an underground ring, facing the behemoth Tong Po (David Bautista, Drax the Destroyer in “Guardians of the Galaxy”). Needless to say, duty calls for Kurt. (I direct you to the movie’s title.)But first there is the inevitable training sequence, which seems to extend for hours. In a compound run by the seasoned instructor Master Durand (an aging Jean-Claude Van Damme, star of the original “Kickboxer,” from which this version lifts elements), Kurt is put through his paces. These include being dunked in a pond while astride a bicycle, doing splits, pulling Master Durand around in a rickshaw and being asked to use his own fists to split coconuts that children lob at him. If it sounds slightly absurd, credit the understated mischief of the director, John Stockwell (“Blue Crush,” “Turistas”), who infuses the proceedings with a winking comic leavening. When Kurt and his love interest, Liu (Sara Malakul Lane), a Thai police officer, encounter masked attackers on a congested street, Kurt must navigate around two passing elephants as he defends himself. In the heat of combat, he momentarily faces one of the animals, but refrains from striking it. You don’t mess with a pachyderm. A less intentional humor arises in brawls designed to highlight Master Durand’s prowess. It takes deft editing to conceal the seams in Mr. Van Damme’s weary exertions, and at that “Kickboxer: Vengeance” only fitfully succeeds. But at least we can bask in the luminous charisma of Ms. Carano, even if she is underused and deprived of a fight scene of her own. (If you haven’t seen her in Steven Soderbergh’s “Haywire,” rent it at once.)Alas, the film’s testosterone cocktail curdles at the end of Kurt and Tong Po’s bloody climactic bout. When cheering Thai spectators are led in a chant of “White warrior!,” the scene queasily evokes grateful villagers praising their conquerors in old adventure serials. That’s when you wish the Thai action star Tony Jaa would step in and teach the filmmakers a thing or two about cultural self-determination. I’d like to say that Mr. Jaa is in the coming sequel. But all we can expect is more Mr. Moussi and Mr. Van Damme. “Kickboxer: Vengeance” is not rated. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/movies/kickboxer-vengeance-review.html
"Review: In ‘Nerve,’ a Shy Girl Seduced by the Internet - The New York Times","apparently, people who can anonymously fill your bank account can also drain it — but the larger problem is a screenplay that amounts to little more than a string of flashy stunts before fizzling to a contrived close. For all its hints at imminent catastrophe, “Nerve” feels surprisingly tame. Juliette Lewis appears briefly as Vee’s spectacularly clueless mother, and the endearing young actor Miles Heizer (so perfectly awkward in NBC’s “Parenthood”) is forced to play Vee’s best friend mostly from inside a car. Internet personalities, like the Instagram comic Josh Ostrovsky, fail to fill in the blanks where real actors should be, but an unusually wide-ranging soundtrack — Wu-Tang Clan and Benny Mardones! — offers spot-that-tune distraction. “Nerve” might have nothing novel to say about the internet, but if it spikes downloads of Roy Orbison’s “You Got It,” who can complain?“Nerve” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Don’t see it if you’re afraid of heights, speeding motorcycles or bare bottoms. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/movies/nerve-review-emma-roberts.html
"Review: ‘Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,’ Antics to Not Love nor Cherish - The New York Times","the co-stars Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick, as well as the character actors Stephen Root and Sam Richardson — were well paid. Somebody needs to come out of this mess ahead. The story is immaterial, and boilerplate. Adam Devine plays Mike; Zac Efron plays his brother, Dave. Their parents — knowing that their sons tend to ruin family events with their unfunny, often dangerous bro-antics (in one flashback, they send their grandfather to the grave) — insist that they bring dates to their sister’s nuptials. The brothers put an ad on Craigslist, which is where Ms. Plaza and Ms. Kendrick come in. Anonymously directed by Jake Szymanski, what follows isn’t really a story, just a succession of thuddingly leaden, patchily strung together bits in service to the underlying theme: Mike and Dave’s fear of sexualized women. Oh, there’s also a racist joke pegged to the singer Seal. You could see “Mike and Dave” as the latest manifestation of white heterosexual male panic run amok. A throwaway line about heteronormativity (I’m sure I heard that right) suggests that someone behind the scenes would like viewers to believe that there’s a degree of self-awareness to all the desperation and yuks about booze, babes and bros. Perhaps there is; whatever. But token reflexivity never got anyone off the hook. It certainly doesn’t obscure the more resonant if completely predictable truth that the movie evinces a profoundly troglodytic worldview toward women. And while that says a lot about Mike and Dave, it says even more about the industry that made this movie. “Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It’s bad for your brain. Running time: 1 hour 45 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/movies/mike-and-dave-need-wedding-dates-review-zac-efron-adam-devine.html
Review: ‘Neither Heaven Nor Earth’ Engages the Horrors of War - The New York Times,"involving dominion over rocks and scrubby trees — are nearly as murky as their larger strategic purpose, which they rarely talk about. The allegiances of their hosts are also unclear. All this simmering unease reaches a crisis when Captain Bonassieu’s men start disappearing. Were they somehow taken by the Taliban? That appears to be the only plausible explanation until a Taliban commander shows up looking for his missing fighters. He and the captain are forced into an unlikely alliance by a common, invisible enemy. I won’t say too much more, except to note that what Mr. Cogitore pulls off is less a plot twist than a genre switch, a feat he executes with impressive dexterity. He sticks to the visual and psychological conventions of war-movie naturalism in order to expose their limitations, and also to find metaphor, magic and metaphysical terror in the midst of grim realities. On the most fundamental level, “Neither Heaven Nor Earth” is an impressive stunt, a horror movie masquerading as a film about the horrors of war. But its gravity and intelligence — the unassuming authority of Mr. Renier’s performance and the sly self-confidence of Mr. Cogitore’s direction — make it something more. It’s not just spooky; it’s genuinely haunting. “Neither Heaven Nor Earth” is not rated. It is in French and Persian, with English subtitles.

Review: ‘Heaven Knows What’ Dramatizes a Young Junkie’s Life - The New York Times,"which is frequently — you glimpse passers-by steering their way around the commotion with the practiced resolve of New Yorkers trying to mind their own business. At the very least, the directors, Josh and Benny Safdie, have created a small, beautiful classic of street theater by rendering these public disputes within a vibrant Manhattan setting through ingenious photography. The Safdies’ focus, Harley (Arielle Holmes), is hooked on heroin and seriously infatuated with a fellow addict, Ilya (Caleb Landry Jones). When we first see Harley, she’s preparing to appease her cruel, weirdly imperious mate with an act of self-destruction that instead tears them apart for a while. All of which might sound hopeless to endure at first, if this fleet-footed film didn’t have such a beautifully attuned eye and ear for Harley and her fellow street dwellers from moment to moment. Harley’s breakaway from Ilya leads us into her usual blur of days and nights on the Upper West Side, in the parks and byways that she and her doper friends call home. She eventually takes up with a boxer-faced dealer, Mike (Buddy Duress), who’s subletting from a raspy-voiced den mother for addicts (apparently in a rent-controlled apartment). From one fix to the next, the movie tumbles right along with Harley; her stringy blond hair and eager eyes still suggest a teenage runaway rather than a burnout. In the film, the screaming need of addiction isn’t front and center, and the Safdies don’t romanticize her life, which is partly drawn from that of Ms. Holmes, who was cast after a street encounter. “Heaven Knows What” portrays Harley’s experiences by building up from ground-level perceptions: the back and forth of shouted arguments and negotiations, the exchanges of glances, the stop and start of street pursuits. The director of photography, Sean Price Williams, skillfully orchestrates lingering close-ups and up-the-street long shots, which are beautifully interwoven in the editing by Ronald Bronstein and Benny Safdie. Ilya, Harley’s obsession, is by any measure a cowardly creep, but this fierce independent is perhaps the most dangerous drug for her. As played by Mr. Jones, the metal-music-loving brooder could nearly be a high school trenchcoat-mafia type if he wasn’t on the streets, yet Harley remains wedded to her starry-eyed vision of self-sacrifice and devotion to him. The paroxysm of feelings that he induces in her seem to be expressed by the analog synthesizer soundtrack and its shuddering cascades (arranged by Isao Tomita from music by Claude Debussy). While Harley’s story is based on Ms. Holmes’s writings (which publicity materials say will soon be a published memoir titled “Mad Love in New York City”), the character remains a bit opaque and not fully formed. That’s perhaps because she hasn’t yet fleshed out her own life beyond chasing Ilya and drugs. But the Safdies avoid using her gamine looks to arouse sympathy for her risky lifestyle, and her druggie milieu seems destined to age better than the walk on the wild side offered by “The Panic in Needle Park.” Born and raised in New York — an upbringing they partly portrayed in their earlier film “Daddy Longlegs” — the Safdie brothers capture a density of activity as endemic to the city as it is to Harley’s daily hustle. By tapping into her routines, instead of framing her along solely tragic lines, the filmmakers fashion a diary of experience that’s all the more absorbing. “Heaven Knows What” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for drug use throughout, pervasive strong language, disturbing and violent images, sexuality and graphic nudity.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/movies/review-heaven-knows-what-dramatizes-a-young-junkies-life.html
‘Heaven Is for Real’ Stars Greg Kinnear - The New York Times,"a delicate operation, as the “Noah” backlash attests — has been ramping up lately, with major players like Ridley Scott and Ben Kingsley mining the Bible for box office gold. But if there’s such a thing as a safe bet in this genre, it’s “Heaven Is for Real,” a Christian sermon that even the most doctrinaire believer can applaud. Already successful as a book in 2010 (and a children’s book the next year, both runaway best sellers), the story of Colton Burpo, the almost-4-year-old who returned from a near-death experience claiming to have detoured through heaven, is a faith-based find. (Colton’s father, Todd, a Nebraska pastor wrote both books with the assistance of the ghostwriter Lynn Vincent.) As the caboose of this franchise, a movie about Colton’s celestial experiences was as likely as the big-tent inoffensiveness of its message. Working with hushed choirs, tasteful beams of light and an ethereal aesthetic, the director, Randall Wallace, and his cinematographer, Dean Semler, transform their Canadian locations into a verdant prairie poem. This earthly paradise may feed the spirit, but it doesn’t fill the bellies of the pastor (Greg Kinnear) — who doubles as a volunteer firefighter, wrestling coach and carpet hauler — and his picture book family. A softball injury and kidney stones help neither his bank balance nor his faith, but luckily both are eventually salvaged when Colton (Connor Corum) surfaces from a ruptured appendix, insisting that he saw seraphim and a horse-riding Jesus. Preachy and pretty, “Heaven” is a classy-looking product with a vanilla flavor and a pastel palette. What friction there is occurs mainly among Todd’s friends and church board members (led by the reliable Margo Martindale and a subdued Thomas Haden Church), who worry that Todd’s public pronouncements will garner a snake-wrangling image for their quiet congregation. Unaddressed are the theological implications of Colton’s description of a Jesus with blue-green eyes — and, according to a painting by a Lithuanian-American girl seen in the film, who makes claims similar to Colton’s, lovely blond highlights. Cleverly circumventing any parental influence, the film allows Colton to deliver his visions in the first person, leaving doubt only in the reliability of everyone’s hearing. What remains could be proof of the Divine or simply the prelude to a tale of how one financially fragile man turned his son’s imaginings — and maybe some of his own — into a phenomenon. This film, at least, has made up its mind. “Heaven Is for Real” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It presents heaven as a place where winged entities float in the sky, old people become young adults, and the unborn grow into happy children.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/movies/heaven-is-for-real-stars-greg-kinnear.html
"In Heaven, Underground: The Weissensee Jewish Cemetery — Review - The New York Times","and death probably tops that list — it’s touching how the practical and the tangible still have their grip. So it’s reassuring when Britta Wauer’s documentary about the Weissensee Jewish Cemetery, one of the oldest active institutions of its kind in Europe, begins with Rabbi William Wolff describing one of his primary tasks: It’s important, he says with a chuckle, to get that coffin in the ground as smoothly as possible. Rabbi Wolff presides over many services in this cemetery north of Berlin, lovingly displayed across the seasons. The place is beautiful, a secluded forest with uneven, obscured rows of dignified stone markers, some 130 years old. A more convincing picture of a cemetery’s quixotic calm would be hard to find. But as the camera swoops in stately fashion up, down and around this oasis, the featured people give this documentary heart: the mourners, of course, but also the coffin makers, the security guards, the groundskeepers, the schoolchildren, the historians, the administrators, the birdwatchers (yes) and the living residents (yes too: a young family with a toddler who have an apartment on the grounds). “Stately” applies to the film’s pace, as well; there’s history here (shots of prewar Berlin are particularly interesting), but the documentary doesn’t offer much narrative momentum. That’s not what it’s about. “In Heaven, Underground” captures the aura of the Weissensee in its many layers. The sense of place may be expected, but it’s also poetic and exquisite.",http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/movies/in-heaven-underground-the-weissensee-jewish-cemetery-review.html

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Contrary to its title, ""All Dogs Go to Heaven 2,"" not every canine in the film ends up perched on a fluffy cloud, smiling beatifically, a halo floating over its head. Near the end of this sequel to the 1989 animated film, one of its scruffier doggie characters actually joins the scarlet-faced feline devil in the underworld. Maybe a better title would have been ""All Dogs Go to Heaven but One.""Although ""Dogs 2,"" which opened yesterday, has its flashes of wit, it is so worried about possibly losing the attention of a young audience that it packs three times as much plot as is necessary into its 75 minutes. As a result, the movie is afflicted with stretches of narrative chaos. The sequel brings back Charlie and Itchy, the original movie's canine sidekicks, and finds a clever way to return them to earth for further adventures. The trouble begins when Carface (Ernest Borgnine), one of the newest celestial arrivals, rebels against the prevailing sweetness and light and tries to steal Gabriel's horn, without which the Pearly Gates can't open. When the instrument accidentally falls to earth, landing in San Francisco, Carface tumbles after it. Charlie (Charlie Sheen) and Itchy (Dom DeLuise) are dispatched to San Francisco to retrieve the horn. But Charlie finds he likes the bad old days too much and is put in touch with a shady character named Red (George Hearn), who is actually the devil in disguise. Red gives the two friends special collars that transform them from angels into dogs for one day, but at a price. Their adventures culminate in a doggie Armageddon during which the angels are sucked out of heaven and imprisoned in a canine Alcatraz. And that isn't the half of it. Charlie also becomes the guardian angel for a little boy who has run away from home and falls in love with Sasha (Sheena Easton), a sleek, doe-eyed nightclub singer. Meanwhile, Carface has his own difficulties.""All Dogs Go to Heaven 2,"" directed by Paul Sabella, makes the mistake of not trusting its characters to be engaging in themselves and relies instead on increasingly frenetic Saturday-morning cartoon-style action to drum up energy. But Ernest Borgnine's tough, cigar-chomping bulldog gets off some good lines, and George Hearn's devil huffs and puffs up a storm. The film's strongest element is its score, by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, the same team who supplied ""Muppet Treasure Island"" with its songs. They have given Ms. Easton a slinky nightclub number, ""Count Me Out,"" that defines Sasha better than any of the dialogue. The best song, ""It's Too Heavenly Here,"" succinctly defines the trouble with paradise: ""Life is much too quiet and too mellow/All your brain cells turn to Jell-O.""""All Dogs Go to Heaven 2"" is rated G (General Audiences).

Review/Film: Heaven and Earth; A Woman's View Of Vietnam Horrors - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from December 24, 1993, Section C, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. MAKING his third film about the Vietnam War and its consequences, Oliver Stone suddenly finds himself on foreign terrain. The reason: ""Heaven and Earth,"" his latest and least controversial film on the subject, tells its story from the standpoint of a Vietnamese woman. This is a tale of extraordinarily melodramatic hardship, involving rape, torture, disgrace, prostitution and a disastrous marriage to an American G. I., all heightened by the despoliation of the heroine's homeland. Her name is Le Ly Hayslip. But considering all these perils, it could have been Pauline. A computer could have suggested that after describing the American soldier's combat experience (""Platoon"") and its aftermath (""Born on the Fourth of July""), Mr. Stone might round out his work with a shift of gender and nationality. But a computer would not have factored in the essentials of Mr. Stone's style. His best direction is volatile, angry and muscular in ways that Ms. Hayslip's story, that of a resilient, long-suffering victim, simply cannot accommodate. Mr. Stone tells this tale vigorously, but he has the wrong cinematic vocabulary for his heroine's essentially passive experience.""Heaven and Earth,"" which opens tomorrow, runs nearly two and a half hours and still manages to seem abrupt in places, thanks to the tumultuous, chameleonlike quality of Ms. Hayslip's life. (Her own account, on which the film is based, fills two books.) It encompasses wild extremes of lyrical beauty -- most notably in the opening glimpses of Le Ly's Vietnamese village -- and of lurid excess, too. The same is true of most of Mr. Stone's films, but this one lacks an emotional center, despite Ms. Hayslip's presence in nearly every scene. Sympathetic as she seems, she is never allowed a wide range of attitudes or reactions. She emerges as a strong person rather than a strong dramatic character. As played with impressive confidence by Hiep Thi Le, a Vietnamese-born California college student making her film debut, Le Ly certainly does not lack energy. She moves through the film with a scrappy vigor that suits her story. First seen as a young girl living with her parents (the beautiful Joan Chen, disguised here as a toothless peasant, and Haing S. Ngor), Le Ly watches apprehensively as the French and then the Viet Cong take over her village. The film often returns evocatively to her memories of a lost, peaceful home. The early sections have the feeling of an illustrated history lesson, despite Mr. Stone's ravishing images of the unspoiled natural scenery. (The film, photographed vibrantly by Mr. Stone's usual cinematographer, Robert Richardson, was shot mostly in Thailand.) Only when Le Ly begins to be abused does the story come perversely alive. After bringing a shade too much zeal to scenes depicting Le Ly's suffering at the hands of the Viet Cong, Mr. Stone next takes her to Da Nang, where she becomes a servant in the household of a wealthy man and soon becomes attracted to, and pregnant by, her employer. The film, trying to present this episode as both romantic and cruel, winds up making it muddy and unconvincing, which is what often happens in sequences describing Le Ly's feelings about men. When Mr. Stone treats his Vietnamese heroine as both sexual martyr and national metaphor, he so overburdens her story that Le Ly disappears as a real person. The film's extremes of masculine guilt are often overpowering, as in the sequence that has Le Ly lured into having lucrative sex with American soldiers. When one G. I. tries to talk her into this (""Fifteen minutes and it ain't even work""), the director sympathetically depicts Le Ly as having no choice and shamefacedly accepting her fate. But as she walks helplessly toward the Americans, she leaves her half-naked baby crying in the dust, in the midst of bustling soldiers, as a truck rolls by. The audience will sense something oversimplified and incredible in such images of Le Ly's total abjection. Certainly ""Heaven and Earth"" sets off sparks with the arrival of Tommy Lee Jones, as the one American soldier who isn't out to exploit this woman. But Mr. Jones, whose Sgt. Steve Butler is a composite of several men the real Ms. Hayslip knew, has a tough row to hoe. Steve changes from unbelievably nice guy into violent, abusive husband in record time, even if these are among the film's most colorful and involving episodes. When Mr. Stone brings Le Ly to the United States as an astonished war bride, he is suddenly comfortable again. He may not know what life in a Vietnamese hamlet is like, but he certainly knows how middle-class America looks, as seen through a worldly and jaundiced eye.""Heaven and Earth"" incorporates an element of Buddhist acceptance and serenity, particularly in the thoughts that end the film on a philosphical note. It seems unimaginable that Mr. Stone would conclude a film about any man's wartime experiences quite this beatifically, no matter how true the film is to Ms. Hayslip's attitudes or her ordeal. On screen, her story is vivid but incomplete, diminished by its nobility and by the director's obvious respect for his subject. Mr. Stone's reverence is understandable. But he remains a fiery, impassioned film maker, and reverence is not what he does best.""Heaven and Earth"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Could the world be so terrible that in the near future unborn babies refuse en masse to leave their mothers' wombs? That is the bizarre supposition of Marion Hansel's deadly earnest film, ""Between Heaven and Earth,"" which opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse. An uneasy hybrid of science fiction and medical information, the movie follows the mood swings of Maria (Carmen Maura), a television journalist in her 40's who becomes pregnant after a one-night encounter with a man in a stalled elevator. Initially thrilled at her impending motherhood, Maria begins having nightmares after meeting, outside her obstetrician's office, a woman who says her unborn child has been screaming warnings about the end of the world. Maria's growing anxiety prompts her to do research, which shows that an alarming number of births are having to be induced. In Maria's dreams, her unborn child (a fetus shown floating in amber liquid) whispers that it doesn't want to enter the world. During a television discussion of induced birth, Maria creates a small panic by announcing her certainty that more and more babies are choosing not to be born. Eventually Maria agrees to have her labor induced to save the child. But moments before the procedure, she overhears two nurses commenting worriedly on the number of stillborn babies they have seen. She flees to the seashore, where she sweet-talks her unborn child into changing its attitude.""Between Heaven and Earth"" is a philosophical cry from the heart, in which all the characters are programmatic stick figures. Jean-Pierre Cassel plays Maria's sexist boss; Didier Bezace, her would-be lover; Samuel Mussen, the metaphysically precocious little boy next door, and Andre Delvaux, a disenchanted genetic engineer. Miss Maura, an actress who has illuminated many of Pedro Almodovar's films, has little to do in the film but run around and look distraught.

At the center of ""Fallen From Heaven"" is a pig as big as a cow. In most Latin-American films, the presence of such a bizarre creature would be a cue to bring on the magical realism, to make the pig fly or at least have some smart conversations. But one of the brightest touches in this alluring film from Peru is that it teeters on the brink of magic without ever resorting to impossible events. Though ""Fallen From Heaven"" ultimately takes the shape of a dark comic parable about life, fate and death, the route to those giant themes is wry, twisty and lighter than a pig's wings. The episodic narrative weaves deftly among three connected sets of characters ranging across Lima's social classes: Lizardo and his wife, Jesus, an old couple bent on completing a marble mausoleum even if it means selling the family heirlooms; their former housekeeper, a blind old woman who lives in a shack with her two small grandsons, and a radio talk-show host whose on-air name is Don Ventura. He tells stories of people who conquer impossible odds and gives inspirational advice that always ends with the take-charge admonition ""You are your fate.""The director, Francisco J. Lombardi, links the story's threads smoothly, without forced connections. Lizardo owns a row of houses. One tenant is Don Ventura. Another is an unimportant character who, instead of paying the rent, offers the old folks the pig, which they give to the blind woman. As ""Fallen From Heaven"" takes us deeper into these apparently ordinary lives, the film begins to question the wisdom of Don Ventura's radio show, called ""Life Lessons."" The characters' circumstances grow darker and more absurd at once. Jesus prays for death, which will unite her with their dead son, while Lizardo warns: ""Don't be in such a rush. We still owe money.""The old woman becomes obsessed with sending her grandsons to the local dump to collect food to fatten up the already-huge pig and will not relent even when the boys are sick and hungry. Seen outside his darkened studio, the sanguine Don Ventura has a deeply scarred face and discovers his own melodrama when he saves a young woman from jumping off a cliff. She moves in with him, chastely, and guards some disturbing secret. The evidence mounts that everyone is dying or wounded or helpless. And the stories eventually yield disturbing questions: Is a house in this world more important than a house in the next? Will a scarred man be repulsed by physical imperfection? How far should you go to feed a prize pig?The plots are tied up in wickedly appropriate and unexpected ways, relying on the kinds of coincidences that only exist in parables and other life lessons. But, the film suggests, who's to say life is less strange than that?The actors are wonderfully restrained, especially Carlos Gassols and Elide Brero, who make Lizardo and Jesus's building plans sweet and sensible. The film wanders vibrantly from a peaceful cemetery to a dump, without making a fuss about social class. That restrained manner gives ""Fallen From Heaven"" much of its effectiveness and its ability to sneak up on viewers with its dark little surprise endings. Running just over two hours, the film feels about 20 minutes too long. But it is worth sitting through some redundant scenes until the story twists back on itself, livelier than ever. ""Fallen From Heaven"" will be shown tonight at 9 and tomorrow at 6 P. M. as part of the New Directors/ New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art. Its playful yet bleak vision is so vividly realized that Mr. Lombardi stands out as a distinctive new voice. Fallen From Heaven Directed by Francisco J.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Haruki Kadokawa's ""Heaven and Earth,"" opening today at the 57th Street Playhouse, is an elaborate but totally weightless Japanese historical film, of less interest for what is on the screen than for how it got there. The movie looks like a wildly expensive vanity production. The time is the 16th century, just a few decades before the events depicted in Hiroshi Teshigahara's superb ""Rikyu."" The story, said to be based on fact, is about the series of battles fought by two strikingly different warlords for the privilege of unifying Japan. On one side is Kagetora, a brilliant strategist who is too humane and spiritual for his own good. He prays a lot and at one point vows to remain celibate if the gods favor him. This causes him no end of woe when he falls in love with a pretty young woman who plays the flute. Kagetora can win battles, but he hesitates when he must put children to the sword. His opponent is less squeamish. He is the older, rougher Takeda, an equally good strategist who does what's necessary to instill fear and trembling in his enemies. According to an opening screen statement, the battles fought by Kagetora and Takeda were ""destined to become a legend in both heaven and earth."" That may be, but they haven't yet made a very good movie. Mr. Kadokawa, who not only is the director but also collaborated on the screenplay and is its executive producer, is not a subtle film maker. The battle scenes were shot in Canada on the Goodstoney Indian Reserve in Morley Flats, Alberta. They are big. The production notes say they involved 3,000 extras, 4,400 spears, 5,800 swords and 16,000 feet of webbing for saber belts. They also have been photographed and edited in such a lofty, impersonal style that it's impossible to tell who's fighting whom, or even to care. It's spectacle for its own sake. This may also be the result of the tepid drama that surrounds the battles. The focus of the film is mostly on Kagetora, a melancholy warlord who is frequently discovered staring off into distances surrounded by falling leaves, sometimes by cherry blossoms. Far more interesting than the movie is the story of Mr. Kadokawa as reported in the production notes. He is a successful publisher who became a film producer in 1976 and directed his first film in 1982. He is also said to be a Shinto priest, a noted adventurer and the author of numerous books. He is active on Broadway, and participated in last season's production of ""The Threepenny Opera"" starring Sting. With James Clavell and Joe Harris, he recently presented ""Shogun: The Musical.""Next year he plans to sail a replica of Columbus's flagship, the Santa Maria, on a 17,000-mile voyage from Barcelona to Japan, in honor of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's 3,000-mile voyage to America.""Heaven and Earth"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some violence.

FILM: 'HEAVEN HELP US' FROM MICHAEL DINNER - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from February 8, 1985, Section C, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. ST. BASIL'S, the Brooklyn parochial school at which ''Heaven Help Us'' takes place, is not the usual setting for schoolboy comedy. But then, ''Heaven Help Us'' is not the familiar assemblage of gags and antics, though it contains enough of these to draw a teen-age crowd. The director Michael Dinner, making his feature debut, and the screenwriter Charles Purpura have an unusually good feeling for the time, the place, the characters as kids and the adults they later turned into. It is this last group at which ''Heaven Help Us,'' like ''Diner'' and the current ''Flamingo Kid,'' is principally aimed. The adults at St. Basil's - the headmaster (Donald Sutherland), the hipster neophyte (John Heard), the sadistic disciplinarian (Jay Patterson) and the sex-crazed priest (Wallace Shawn) who insists on a lecture about lust and hellfire just before a school dance - are as well-drawn as their students, which gives the film an effective tension. So does the casting of the young men, who are a diverse but memorable lot: quiet, serious Michael Dunn (Andrew McCarthy), a new boy with a sad history; Caesar (Michael Danare), who's the resident egghead and looks like Richard Dreyfuss crossed with a walrus; and Rooney, a likable lout played by Kevin Dillon, who resembles his brother Matt. In a smaller role, Stephen Geoffreys speaks volumes while barely saying anything, as a boy with absolutely no control over what the priests keep telling him are his basest impulses.''Heaven Help Us,'' which formerly had the much more apt title ''Catholic Boys'' and which opens today at the Gemini, works as a series of vignettes, the best of them detailing life in the small, claustrophobic St. Basil's community. Waiting on line to make their confessions, the boys engage in a form of plea-bargaining; they tone down their most blatant sins and then just add lying to the list. Running afoul of their most vicious teacher, they may find themselves wearing gum on their noses or balancing volumes of the encyclopedia in either hand for long stretches. The teachers, for their part, can't stand to hear ''Dominique'' on the radio and are moved to tears when they venture to Manhattan to watch the Pope make his visit. The boys, seeing this temporary softening on the part of the faculty, use this as an occasion to sneak off to the movies to watch Elvis in ''Blue Hawaii.''At obligatory intervals, Mr. Dinner must give one of the kids a chance to wreck his father's car or throw up or whatever; he also ends the film with a jokey and superfluous epilogue. If that gives ''Heaven Help Us'' a certain inconsistency of tone, it doesn't damage the small, well-observed moments Mr. Dinner handles best. A good example is Michael Dunn's courtship of the pretty, sullen tomboy who runs the local soda fountain (Mary Stuart Masterson), a sequence made gently effective as they dance to an Otis Redding song and wind up under the boardwalk. Mr. Dinner gives this episode some novelty and emotional force by keeping it sexually ambiguous, and by giving Michael a subsequent scene with his kid sister that puts the romance into larger perspective. The look of ''Heaven Help Us,'' one that's almost comically gloomy, is captured by the cinematographer Miroslav Ondricek and enhanced by some well-chosen props, particularly the unfashionable eyeglasses that turn up on much of the cast. Mr. Danare's make him especially funny, though he would be anyhow. At the other end of this film's wide temperamental spectrum, Mr. Patterson's make a prim, malicious teacher seem all the more frightening.

A Film by Beatty:A Remake of 1941 - The New York Times,"at least in its life-after-death form — doesn't hold the fascination for us that it does when there's a war going on, as there was in 1941 when ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" was released and became such a hit. Or perhaps we are somewhat more sophisticated today (though I doubt it) and comedies about heavenly messengers and what is, in effect, a very casual kind of transubstantiation seem essentially silly. Whatever the reason, ""Heaven Can Wait,"" Warren Beatty's remake of ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan,"" gives the impression of being a swinging 1978 romantic comedy struggling to free itself from the body of the 1941 film. Most of the time it remains locked in, embraced by the unyielding requirements of its elaborate, facetious plot gimmick. This, as in ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan,"" which also was based on a play titled ""Heaven Can Wait,"" is about a professional athlete, a star quarter-back with the Los Angles Rams, who is accidentally gathered by a heavenly messenger before his time has come. When the mistake is realized, the athlete, named Joe Pendleton (Mr. Beatty), is escorted back to earth to find a suitable body to inherit so that Joe can go on to play in the Super Bowl. That, unfortunately, is just the beginning, though it takes so much screen time to tell that the audience is always ahead of it. The surprise is that ""Heaven Can Wait"" is as much fun as it is when it has to waste so much energy in the service of a gimmick that we would now endure only in a pilot film for a projected television series titled ""I Dream of Joey.""The movie, which opens today at Loews State 2 and other theaters, is a hybrid of no great style but of a good deal of charm and with a marvelous cast headed by Julie Christie, Jack Warden, Dyan Cannon, Buck Henry, James Mason and Mr. Beatty, who stars in the film, produced it, co-directed it (with Mr. Henry) and co-wrote the screenplay (with Elaine May). Only time and innate modesty, I assume, prevented him from acting as his own assistant producer. Though updated from the 40's, the May-Beatty screenplay seems to follow closely the earlier film, written by Sidney Buchman and Seton I. Miller, yet only Harry Segall, the author of the play, is given screen credit. Some of the film's best moments, however, are random inspirations of dialogue and bits of business that recall the tone of Miss May at the peak of her comic form. The film's funniest characters are not played by Mr. Beatty or Julie Christie (as the spunky English girl Joe Pendleton falls in love with). They are Joe's wife (when he is in the body of a wealthy nut named Farnsworth) and her lover, a pair of scheming, would-be murderers of the sort Miss May showed such fondness for in ""A New Leaf."" The characters are well written and beautifully played by Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin. I suspect that no one but Miss May (and possibly Buck Henry) would envision a scene in which one of the murderers, expecting at any minute to be discovered, says to his accomplice when the police are about to enter the drawing room, ""Pick up 'The Fountainhead' and pretend to be reading.""The film's associations to time are nothing if not eclectic. Memories of ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" evoke the 1930's and early 40's. ""The Fountainhead"" suggests the late 40's and early 50's. The Rams and pro football are very much of today, while the very funny populist speech that Joe Pendleton delivers (in the body of Mr. Farnsworth to a board of directors' meeting) recalls Frank Capra's comedies of the mid-30's. All of which may lead you to believe — correctly — that ""Heaven Can Wait"" hasn't much personality of its own. Instead it has a kind of earnest cheerfulness that is sometimes most winning. Mr. Beatty and Miss Christie are performers who bring to their roles the easy sort of gravity that establishes characters of import, no matter how simply they are drawn in the script. Neither James Mason as Mr. Jordan, the fellow in charge of recently gathered souls, nor Mr. Henry, as the messenger who botched his first job, have much to do, but they are presences we recognize. In a much more colorful part, that of Joe Pendleton's trainer, Jack Warden must bridge the gap between the film's sentimental impulses and its lunatic comedy, and he succeeds with ease. All of these people, though, are upstaged by a plot that keeps butting into the movie just as it's building some comic momentum. There's nothing worse than a pushy narrative.""Heaven Can Wait,"" which has been rated PC (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some language that, I suppose, could be called grown-up if not adult, but there is nothing else in the movie to disturb the smallest mind. A Remake of 1941HEAVEN CAN WAIT, directed by Warren Beatty and Buck Henry; screenplay by Elaine May and Mr. Beatty, based on a play by Harry Segall; produced by Mr. Beatty; executive producers, Howard W.

PRESUMABLY, the distributors responsible for placing ""Heaven on Earth"" on view at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse yesterday had some prospective paying customers in mind. Exactly whom they expect to please with this curious mélange of travelogue, art documentary, adolescent romance and rock 'n' roll, however, is a mystery worth pondering. For sight-seers, the film has an assortment of attractive color shots of the more familiar tourist attractions in Rome, including churches, prisons and catacombs. Guide-book descriptions are delivered in a thick Italian accent by the young leading man, Gabriele Tinti. For plot addicts, there is an inconsequential love story involving a handsome young Italian who blames Americans for killing his mother during World War II, but overcomes his prejudice in the process of guiding a pretty bobby-soxer around the city. The romance is left unresolved, and it is amateurishly acted by Signor Tinti and Barbara Florian, but the youthful faces do provide occasional relief from the monuments. For admirers of spectacle, excerpts from what appear to be recent Italian costume epics are presented to illustrate vaguely the hero's tales of Roman history. In several of these, the young protagonists appear in full costume, looking a little foolish as they watch sparring gladiators, secret Christian gatherings and cardboard battle scenes. For art lovers, there are brief glimpses of several score of statues, frescoes and paintings by Michelangelo, Raphael, Botticelli and others. The camera rarely pauses long enough for contemplation of any of these. For patrons more interested in religion, there is a camera tour of the Vatican and a long recapitulation of the papal conclave leading to the election of Pope John XXIII. This climactic section includes, for no apparent reason, bits of newsreel footage offering glimpses of Cardinal Mindzenty and the Hungarian uprising. As a final fillip for teen-agers, the young heroine, moping over her inevitable departure from Rome, listens to some street musicians and suddenly bursts into a rock 'n' roll ballad, wailing something to the effect that she is all of 17 and still searching for love. Perhaps Robert Spafford, who wrote and directed this pointless pot-pourri, hoped to provide something for everybody. As usual, in such misguided endeavors, he has accomplished the opposite result.

THE by-now-familiar landscape of brazen Brigitte Bardot gets some noticeable competition from the rugged landscape of southeastern Spain in ""The Night Heaven Fell,"" a French film in CinemaScope and color that opened at the Odeon and Fine Arts yesterday. And without running down the vivid vistas you get from time to time of La Bardot, we must say the gorgeous Spanish scenery outmatches her, two for one. For the curious fact is the famous ""kitten"" is miserably used in this film, which went in France under the title of the novel by Albert Vidalie from which it is taken, ""Les Bijoutiers du Clair de Lune."" All she does is act a sort of meek companion tagging along with a desperate young man who has murdered her uncle, seduced her aunt, evaded capture (with her assistance) and is now taking it on the lam. In this unlikely situation she hasn't much else to do than occasionally peel down to the bare essentials (under pretext of the oppressive heat) and chase foolishly after Stephen Boyd. This craggy young man, whose one expression suggests that he's just doing this for the Job, appears more intent on making mileage than on dallying with La Bardot. When Roger Vadim, the director, finally lines up the pair for a clinch, Mr. Boyd submits with such blandness that they'd just as well be back on the road. Under these circumstances, there isn't much zing in La Bardot. She takes her cue from the proceedings and not only acts but also looks immature. Half the time she's running barefoot, with her hair in matted strings. She also is called upon to take a fancy to a burro and a pig. Crossing the wires on her this way rather runs down the battery of La Bardot. However, the scenery is dramatic, even if the story is not, M. Vadim has made a harsh antagonist of the broken landscape of Malaga. A gleaming villa sprawled upon a hilltop looking toward the distant sea serves as the point of departure for journeys that take the characters to the primitive village of Mijas, its ancient bullring and to country beyond. The one valid thing about the picture is its scenery. Alida Valli and Pepe Nieto are the hapless aunt and uncle. The film, as shown at the Fine Arts, has dialogue in French and Spanish, with English subtitles to give the translation. At the Odeon, it has dubbed English dialogue.

"Screen: 'Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison'; Story of a Marine and a Nun Is at the Roxy Jeff Chandler Stars in 'Tattered Dress' - The New York Times","indeed, in the only real roles in the picture—he has got it buckled to solid characters. Actually, the main entertainment is in the tensions and crises that occur while the Japanese are on the island and the fugitives have to forage for food. By far the most fascinating incident is a one-man expedition by the marine into a Japanese storehouse where he is forced to hide under the noses of the enemy all night. At this sort of thriller detail, Mr. Huston can't be beat. In and among the action episodes, Mr. Huston and Mr. Mahin have laced some humorous and touching conversations for the fugitives that reveal and develop a nice relationship. Their common peril and mutual anxiety lead them naturally to consideration and respect. It is inevitable that, at one point, the marine should think it love. This crux of the personal drama is treated with tenderness and tact. The crisis is brief and simple, and the picture ends with a standard action bang. If there does seem to be some repetition, that is something that has to be blamed on the singleness of the location and the meagerness of the cast. There are not many variations to be wrung from the situation. However, the location is exciting—an actual spot on the island of Tobago was used to simulate a South Pacific island, and it is drenched with atmosphere. And the cast, while small, is excellent. Mr. Mitchum is a rugged, blunt marine and Miss Kerr is a pretty, compassionate, resolutely devoted nun. In CinemaScope and color, this makes a handsome film. They should go right back to Tobago when ""South Pacific"" is to be made. HEAVEN KNOWS, MR. ALLISON, screen play by John Lee Mahin and John Huston; based on the novel by Charles Shaw; directed by Mr. Huston; produced by Buddy Adler and Eugene Frenke for Twentieth century-Fox. At the Roxy. Sister Angela . . . . . Deborah KerrMr. Allison . . . . . Robert MitchumIF the Goddess of Justice is not blind, as generally pictured, then she certainly is myopic, to judge by ""The Tattered Dress,"" which was exposed at the Mayfair yesterday. For this workmanlike and sometimes absorbing melodrama is weakened by this basic premise: that its young, famous but cynical criminal lawyer can sway juries by using either a vast knowledge of human failings and legal tricks of the trade or, when his own fate is at stake, simple fervent truths. The evidence presented in both cases is nominal. Our hero's gift of tongues is not that persuasive. However, Jack Arnold and his scenarist, George Zuckerman, have succeeded in keeping their principals moving at a brisk pace. Also, it should be added, they are thoughtfully delineated in the main. The rugged and somewhat arrogant James Gordon Blane takes on the murder defense of rich, fast and loose and shapely Charleen Reston and her weakling husband for the money that is in it for him. Resentment is rife in the California desert town, but our barrister gets his social clients an acquittal by the simple ruse of having the seemingly genial sheriff (a close friend of the murdered man) unwittingly blacken the victim's character. Our sheriff is a gent who knows a dirty trick or two himself, and first thing you know our legal eagle is charged with bribing a juror (the sheriff's paramour). As has been noted, the lawyer's desperate defense, stressing abiding truths, is hinged on the statement that ""in every act of violence justice also is a victim.""As the beleaguered lawyer Jeff Chandler does a forthright and forceful stint. His climactic dialogue, however, has the hollow ring of theatrical declamation rather than the impact of convincing facts. Jack Carson does a slick job as the smiling but scheming arm of the law. Gail Russell has an effective scene or two as his partner in double-dealing. As the blond social temptress Elaine Stewart is provocative enough in that ""tattered dress"" to distract an avowed misogynist. Jeanne Crain is decorative too as the estranged but loving wife of our hero. They all see justice done fairly effectively if not convincingly.

They'll have to put an extra car on that cinematic heaven-to-earth train if the boys don't pretty soon stop calling upon ambassadors from above to motivate screen plays. In ""Heaven Only Knows,"" which arrived yesterday at the Broadway Theatre, Robert Cummings makes a reluctant excursion to earth to rectify another one of those ""auditing department"" mistakes. Seems someone forgot to enter Duke Byron in the Book of Life and as a consequence he has no soul and therefore no comprehension of man's true mission in life. The setting this time is a Western mining town run jointly by Duke and Bill Plumber, who are on the cuts and, while attempting to ruin each other by closing down the mine, deprive the town folks of a chance to make a living. Mr. Cummings runs through what by now is a pretty familiar set of rebuffs and moments of despair in completing his appointed mission. Some of the picture is mildly amusing and there is a bit of excitement when the rival gambling casinos go up in flames, but there is an overly coy note to the romantic sequences. On the whole ""Heaven Only Knows"" comes through as a tolerable entertainment, with such good moral intentions that one may overlook its self-conscious awkwardness in this regard. Mr. Cummings, it seemed to us, never did quite make up his mind whether to be serious or plain supercilious as the detached Archangel Michael. Brian Donlevy as the Duke also never gets any conviction into his role. Marjorie Reynolds and Jorja Curtright are by turn properly indignant and sweetly romantic as the leading ladies.

"THE SCREEN; ' Heaven Can Wait,' an Amusing Comedy of Manners, With Don Ameche, Gene Tierey and Charles Coburn, Opens at Roxy - The New York Times","and Mr. Raphaelson, who based the script on a Lazlo Bus-Fekete play—are laughing with gentle affection at the pruderies of yesterday. Their picture has utterly no significance. Indeed, it has very little point, except to afford entertainment. And that it does quite well. It begins with an elderly gentleman, obviously departed from this life, applying for permanent admission at the place to which so many have said he would go. Modestly he confesses that he wouldn't even apply up above. But His Excellency, who passes on the sinners, is a little bit doubtful of this case, so he sternly demands credentials, and the gentleman gives them—for high two hours—while Heaven waits:He tells—or rather, does the picture—of his earliest experiences with girls, when he discovered, to his lasting confusion, that, to win them, you must have plenty of coin. And then he recounts his young manhood as the scion of wealthy New York aristocrats and of his frivolous ways with the ladies, which shocked his parents and pleased his stiff granddad, concluding that phase by eloping with the fiancée of his strait-laced cousin. The second—and less amusing—half of the picture continues the married life of this wayward gent, his silly estrangement from his darling and their reunion, with grandpa to egg them on. And it fritters out in old-age sentiment which is punctured by one sharp Lubitsch ""touch."" Mr. Lubitsch fortunately manages to top it off with an innocent, genial leer. The character of the rakish hero is never clearly defined, nor is that of the girl who marries him. He remains an ambiguous changeling, and so does she. That may be one reason why Don Ameche and Gene Tierney are flat in the roles. Or rather, they lack the flexibility which such mannered comedy demands. But so many other characters are so amusingly written and played that the lack is not overpowering. Charles Coburn as grandpa is great—a curmudgeon full of venom and gleeful naughtiness. Marjorie Main and Eugene Pallette play a pair of Kansas inlaws screamingly, and through them Mr. Lubitsch and Mr. Raphaelson satirize wealth in a lusty vein. Mention should be made of Allyn Joslyn's goody-goody prig and of Louis Calhern's Father and of several in lesser roles. But those you will personally discover, for the film is certainly one you'll want to see. It loses tempo occasionally. It drags a bit toward the end.

"THE SCREEN; 'All This and Heaven, Too,' With Bette Davis and Boyer, at Music Hall--'Private Affairs' at Roxy At the Roxy - The New York Times","especially that of small and evil minds—is the two-hour-and-twenty-minute traffic upon the screen of the Music Hall, where the Warners freely derived film version of Rachel Field's novel, ""All This and Heaven, Too,"" triumphantly arrived yesterday. Picture-goers who are prepared to suffer the tortures of fate with Bette Davis and Charles Boyer for that unconscionable length of time—and the number is probably legion—will find the film a source of much emotional satisfaction; others of less Spartan stamp will certainly protest that it wears out their patience in the telling of a comparatively uncomplicated tale. For the Warners are here handing out a tear-laden old-fashioned drama—and a very heavy one, too. Miss Field's long historical novel encompassed the amazingly varied life of one rather fabulous woman, a Mlle. Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, who started out in 1841 as a governess in the family of the Duc de Praslin and ended as the dignified wife of a distinguished American. In the years between she was the center of a domestic upheaval in the Praslin household, the apparent cause of the duchess's murder and the duke's suicide and the innocent defendant in one of the most celebrated trials in French history. For the purposes of the picture, however, the Warners have taken only the account of the governess's service with the Praslins, including its tragic climax, and have introduced and concluded it with a brief prologue and epilogue set in America. The details of that lengthy account have been considerably altered and telescoped, too. For those who read the novel, this fact is merely mentioned. Probably they'll prefer to call it ""Some of This and Heaven, Too.""On the screen, then, we have the poignant story of a tender love which grows up between the governess and the tragically frustrated duke—a love which is born of their mutual adoration of the duke's children and which is propelled to its violent climax by the action of his insanely jealous wife. It is a subsurface love, never actually expressed, forever unfulfilled, and only clarified when the duke, on his death-bed, whispers, ""I love her with every drop of blood I have."" The theme is the classic one of all romantic tragedy, scored in the conventional manner with love's song and love's death. But unfortunately, there are too many words and not enough music. Alert to the opportunity, Miss Davis and Mr. Boyer put all the ""soul"" they possess into the playing of the principal roles. Under the slow-paced direction of Anatole Litvak, they carry through mainly on one somber key—Miss Davis with her large eyes filled with sadness and her mouth drooping heavily with woe, Mr. Boyer with his face a rigid mask, out of which his dark eyes signal pain. Barbara O'Neil as the termagant duchess considerably overplays the part, but genuine and tender performances are given by Virginia Weidler, June Lockhart, Ann Todd and Richard Nichols as the lively Praslin brood. Frankly—and this is commentary—we'd a great deal rather know whatever became of them than what became of the governess.

Ann GillisYou won't find much rhyme or reason in ""Private Affairs,"" which came to the Roxy yesterday, but you will find Hugh Herbert, and that should explain everything. For Mr. Herbert tossed sanity overboard long ago, and the script writers, at least in the present case, have followed suit. Perhaps it is just as well, for things move pretty slowly until Angus McPherson, otherwise our hero, arrives on the scene. After that ""Private Affairs"" becomes anybody's affair and crazy-quilt comedy where anything goes for a laugh. Somewhere amid all the harebrained tomfoolery there is a story of sorts in which Roland Young, as the long-dispossessed son of a Boston Brahmin, rises from the position of a Wall Street ""board boy"" to make good on his own. But only after his daughter, whom he has been forbidden to see during all these years, implores his aid in escaping the tyrannical rule of the elder Bullerton. To all this the anarchial Mr. Herbert is only an impediment or vice versa. As taxi driver by necessity and D. P. C. (Doctor of Pest Control) by avocation he causes a flurry in chemical stocks on the Exchange by predicting the early demise of the insect hordes; when old Bullerton's presence is required at a party Mr. Herbert strews the Beacon Hill mansion with cockroaches to get him out of the house. Nancy Kelly, Mr. Young and the remaining cast keep step smartly, but for better or worse the picture is largely Mr. Herbert's. The folk at the Roxy yesterday seemed to like it. So did we.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Is nothing sacred to the makers of ""Hot Shots! Part Deux""? Nope. Not a thing. In their latest sendup of Hollywood-style heroics, the team behind this deliciously silly satire takes aim at every imaginable target from ""Sea Hunt"" to Saddam Hussein (who is revealed, at least by this account, to have a fondness for chintz). And the comic carnage doesn't stop there: ""Hot Shots!"" also trifles with hit films from ""The Wizard of Oz"" to ""Basic Instinct,"" along the way revealing the secret of ""The Crying Game."" Don't even consider seeing it unless you can find humor in a line like this: ""These men have taken a vow of celibacy, like their fathers and their fathers before them.""As directed shamelessly by Jim Abrahams (one-third of the original ""Airplane!"" team) and written by Mr. Abrahams and Pat Proft, this second ""Hot Shots!"" parody relies on a dependable method, if not an especially classy one. The film makers are happy to lob jokes at their audience with head-spinning speed, content in the knowledge that at least some of these missiles will hit the broad side of the barn. So ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" had better be watched closely for its quick takeoffs, sneaky background action and various female characters who (as the closing credits indicate) happen to have ""Rodham"" as their middle names. Less closely tethered to any one comic source than the first ""Hot Shots!"" was to ""Top Gun,"" this sequel nonetheless finds a lot to work with in ""Rambo."" Hidden away in a remote Asian monastery, the heroic Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is tracked down by Col. Denton Walters (Richard Crenna, poking fun at his own ""Rambo"" role). ""Topper, let me tell you a little story,"" begins the colonel, trying to recruit his man for a secret hostage-rescuing mission. He then regales him with the tale of Goldilocks and the three bears.""So what you're saying is that little blond girl is . . . me!"" muses Topper, ever the straight man. Mr. Sheen doesn't have to be overly funny at such moments. All he has to do is squint suspiciously and look a wee bit confused by what goes on around him, which grows ever more confusing by the minute. Among the satirical episodes found here are a ""No Way Out"" limousine scene, a tearful railroad station scene involving a train that's bound for Hawaii, a ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" morphing effect that turns Saddam Hussein into mercury droplets but has trouble putting him back together and a version of the ""Basic Instinct"" interrogation scene that provides Mr. Sheen with the perfect rejoinder for Brenda Bakke's Sharon Stone type. It's too good to spoil by repeating it here. The film's single biggest laugh comes from a moment that finds Mr. Sheen and his real-life father, Martin Sheen, on separate riverboats as they mutter to themselves while venturing into ""Apocalypse Now"" country. And its best sustained gags feature Lloyd Bridges in the role of Tug Benson, the hearty, mixed-up sportsman who has somehow become the President of the United States (he was only an admiral in the first film). ""He'll try to prove that you're incompetent,"" Benson is warned about a rival, prompting him to declare, ""I can prove that as well as he can!"" Of course, ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" cannot resist engaging President Benson in a messy confrontation with Japan's Prime Minister, complete with still-wriggling sushi that accounts for his indigestion. Notwithstanding that episode, this film is refreshingly low on scatological gags and other gross-out humor, preferring all-purpose bad jokes to bathroom ones. (""It's not all I hoped for,"" Topper says of ""Great Expectations."") The only scenes in which it bogs down noticeably are the violent episodes, since the real thing is hard to make fun of. This film does offer a running tally to indicate when its body count beats those of a couple of acknowledged blood-and-guts classics. Within this film's cast of extremely good sports, Miguel Ferrer is well used as a nail-spitting tough guy who becomes worried when he briefly loses the desire to kill. Valeria Golino returns charmingly as Ramada, the woman Topper really loves, although he would probably be just as happy with Ms. Bakke's Michelle, a sleek Central Intelligence Agency operative. ""Why me, ma'am?"" Topper asks manfully when she first tries to recruit him for a dangerous mission. ""Because you're the best of what's left,"" she sweetly replies.""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild profanity, brief nudity and several sexual situations, one of which involves the use of a diving board. Hot Shots!

"FILM REVIEW; Throw Off The Yoke, But Keep The G-String - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from October 20, 2000, Section E, Page 17Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Julia Query, who made ''Live Nude Girls Unite!'' in collaboration with Vicky Funari, was raised by her feminist mother to believe, she says, ''in freedom, justice and equality for all.'' A graduate-school dropout, stand-up comedian and aspiring writer, Ms. Query -- shown in an early home-movie clip reading ''Free to Be . . . You and Me'' with her mother -- has also worked as a stripper at a San Francisco peep-show house called the Lusty Lady. Her job, in addition to paying the bills and providing fodder for her stand-up routine, landed her in the middle of an issue that has divided feminists for years. Some women insist that exotic dancing and other sex work is inherently degrading. Others find it a liberating expression of free choice and sexual independence. Ms. Query, after a while, just found it boring. In other words, it was a job. ''Live Nude Girls Unite!,'' which opens today at the Quad, displays its share of exposed flesh, but at heart it's a movie about work, part of the rich tradition of labor documentaries that includes Barbara Kopple's ''Harlan County, U. S. A.,'' and ''American Dream.'' The idea of a strippers' union may seem farfetched, even laughable at first; the owners of the Lusty Lady and San Francisco's municipal authorities certainly thought so. But Ms. Query's film effectively makes the case that work, whatever you wear or don't wear when you're doing it, is still work. The dancers at the Lusty Lady have tuition to pay and children to raise, and the claims they make hardly seem extravagant: job security, paid sick days, a safe working environment. Before the organizing drive began, the film asserts, dancers were routinely fired and non-white dancers were routinely discriminated against. (At upscale lap-dancing clubs, working conditions are shown to be worse: the dancers must pay extortionate ''stage fees'' and work as independent contractors, without the protections afforded regular employees or the possibility of union protection.)Ms. Query is a cheerful, smart on-camera presence on and off the job. Without excessive political posturing, her film quietly dismantles stereotypes about women who work in the sex industry and makes its powerful feminist and pro-union argument with unpretentious good humor. The women who work at the Lusty Lady are diverse and, as their bosses (many of whom are women) soon discover, politically savvy. The sight of them at work may be titillating -- though, as filmed from the dancers' own point of view, it's not terribly erotic -- but the real thrill is in their fight to form a union and then to negotiate a contract. Ms. Query captures the story's intrinsic suspense as the dancers, helped by a negotiator from Local 790 of the Service Employees International Union, agonize about whether to strike or to accept a less-than-ideal contract offer. At the end, their struggle inspires others in the industry, and Ms. Query and her friend Decadence fly to Pennsylvania and Alaska to spread the word. The movie is enriched by another, less easily resolved drama involving Ms. Query and her mother, Dr. Joyce Wallace, a physician who is known for her extensive outreach work with prostitutes in New York. In one of her stand-up performances, Ms. Query notes that while it was relatively easy to tell her mother that she was a lesbian, she hasn't been able to ''come out'' as an exotic dancer. When she does, at a conference on prostitution both have been invited to address, the scene is raw and painful, not least because the two women seem so alike in their tough-minded dedication to their convictions. Believe it or not, ''Live Nude Girls Unite!'' is a movie that would make any mother proud. LIVE NUDE GIRLS UNITE!Written and directed by Julia Query and Vicky Funari; directors of photography, Ms. Query, John Montoya, Sarah Kennedy and Ms. Funari; edited by Ms. Funari and Heidi Rahlmann Plumb; music by Allison Hennessy and Kali with Alex Kort, Blaise Smith and Dale Everingham, and Khayree Shaheed; produced by Ms. Query and Mr. Montoya; released by First Run Features.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. There is a major cosmetic change in the latest edition of the ""House Party"" series, starring the hip-hop team of Kid 'N Play. Kid has traded in his improbably high fade haircut -- the one that made people call him ""eraserhead"" in the original movie -- for a topknot of dreadlocks. But it would take more than that to keep this series fresh. ""House Party 3"" has lost the loose-limbed, high-spirited spark of the original ""House Party"" (the director Reginald Hudlin's knock-'em-dead debut) and the fun-loving spirit of ""House Party 2"" (directed by Doug McHenry and George Jackson).""House Party 3,"" which had its low-profile opening yesterday, begins with the smart-sounding premise that Kid 'N Play can't pretend to be partying teen-agers forever. Kid (Christopher Reid) is engaged to be married, and Play (Christopher Martin) arranges what's meant to be a blowout bachelor party. Kid's fiancee, Veda (Angela Means), is set to have a premarital party of her own. This time Kid's three prepubescent cousins -- the hip-hop group Immature, playing themselves -- are the ones who plot a forbidden house party. If you haven't seen the first ""House Party"" films, there's no point in trying to catch up now. And if you have, there's still no point in witnessing this dull by-the-numbers sequel. You can see every party mix-up coming from here.""House Party 3"" shows other signs of late-serial desperation. This edition is rougher, less Cosby, than the earlier movies. Each of the three parties has its own stripper, providing equal-gender exploitation for male and female dancers. There is a string of fat-lady jokes. Still, this is a far cry from gangster rap. The comedian Bernie Mac has some high-energy moments as Kid's brash Uncle. Kid 'N Play themselves haven't lost their appeal. They're just trapped in a cookie-cutter script that even makes the music blend into the background (an odd situation, since this is the first film by Eric Meza, a music-video director). Immature seems to get the most musical screen time. They're cute, but they're not movie stars.""House Party 3"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or guardian).

Though Reginald Hudlin wrote and directed the original, and though Doug McHenry and George Jackson produced and directed ""House Party 2,"" the line separating the films is invisible.""House Party 2"" is an equally entertaining mix of comedy and music (rap and hip-hop) about the adventures of Kid (Christopher Reid), the young man with the Eraserhead hair, and his less serious pal Play (Christopher Martin), when Kid goes off to college and Play loses Kid's tuition check. That's all there is to the story but not to the movie, which somehow makes manifest such abstractions as good humor and high spirits. Written by Rusty Cundieff and Daryl G. Nickens, the movie centers around Kid and his encounters with teachers and fellow students at Harris University, while Play tries to make good on the lost check. The only way to recoup the money so that Kid can remain in school is, finally, a campus pajama party, the ""jammie jam jam"" that is to ""House Party 2"" what the seaside picnic was to Annette Funicello and her friends in ""Beach Blanket Bingo.""Among the film's more notable performers are Iman, the high-fashion model, as the new-age vamp who parts Play from Kid's check; Tisha Campbell, as Kid's girlfriend, nearly lost to a campus women's movement; Queen Latifah, who is fine as an actress and sensational as a singer; Kamron, of the rap group Young Black Teen-Agers, who is very funny as Kid's blue-eyed roommate, speaking a black jargon unintelligible to anyone else. The movie has the manner of a succession of specialty numbers, though it is far more cannily constructed than that. It moves along with the wit and pacing of a revue, its young characters somehow being both irreverent and idealized at the same time. The casting is especially good, including the several comparatively senior members of the cast: Georg Stanford Brown, who appears as Kid's African studies professor, and Tony Burton, who plays the chef in the college dining hall as if he had been trained by General Patton. William Schallert, one of the few white actors in the movie, behaves with courage and nobility as Harris University's bewildered dean. Whoopi Goldberg turns up several times in an unbilled cameo performance, playing the sort of joyfully ghoulish professor who haunts the imagination of every lazy student. This is the first movie to be directed by Mr. McHenry and Mr. Jackson, who also produced ""New Jack City."" ""House Party 2"" seems to have been packaged as much as directed. However it was put together, it works.""House Party 2,"" which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has a lot of vulgar language and sexual innuendo.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. There were two ways of looking at the ending of ""Broadcast News,"" the witty, rueful, amazingly perceptive 1987 romantic comedy by James L. Brooks that has made Mr. Brooks's next film so well worth waiting for. In ""Broadcast News,"" you may recall, a high-strung television producer named Jane found herself falling in love with an unreasonably successful newscaster named Tom, who represented everything Jane found troubling about her profession. Tom was bad news -- quite literally. But he was also terrifically charming, which made Jane's tortured response all too easy to understand. So should Jane take Tom up on his 11th-hour proposition? Should she stop hiding behind her scruples and try to live happily ever after? There must have been viewers who wished that ""Broadcast News"" had managed a sunnier ending, but they missed the point. The intelligence and generosity with which Mr. Brooks described Jane's moral dilemma were precisely what made the film so fine. A deep, lingering seriousness colored even its lightest moments. Good news: That same acuity is at the heart of ""I'll Do Anything,"" Mr. Brooks's droll, improbably buoyant near-musical about an out-of-work actor and his scary little daughter. This time, the film maker turns his attention to Hollywood, which he presents as a place ruled by insane paradox. The movie executives seen here are infantile, self-involved and arrogant. Not surprisingly, these are qualities that Mr. Brooks has no trouble rendering in high comic style. (Imagine an executive who, learning that his driver is late because there was a shooting on the freeway, bellows: ""You should leave time for that kind of thing!""). But self-important as they are, these high rollers live and die by the opinions of ordinary moviegoers, provided that those opinions have been quantified in quasi-scientific fashion. It's true that common folk inspire nothing but contempt in Burke Adler (Albert Brooks), a producer who proudly announces that his lamps say more about his taste than his movies do. But it's also true that Burke quails over the results of audience preview cards. During the course of the story, those cards lead to the drastic cutting of Burke's latest action picture, in which the star is seen slugging somebody with a side of beef, and identify Burke's most satisfied customers as 11-year-old boys. It's almost fitting that ""I'll Do Anything"" has come to illustrate the writer and director's satirical premise, since this film lost its musical numbers (written by Prince, Sinead O'Connor and others, and choreographed by Twyla Tharp) after a preview audience delivered a thumbs-down verdict. It's also a shame. Even in its present song-free form, miraculously reconstituted without many glaring gaps, ""I'll Do Anything"" remains defiantly quirky. Audiences that appreciate Mr. Brooks's sensibility would have followed this film anywhere, even into musical interludes that were probably more redolent of ""The Singing Detective"" than ""Singin' in the Rain.""The film's main character is Matt Hobbs (Nick Nolte), who reveals himself in a prologue. In 1980, as a nominee for the best-actor Emmy, Matt didn't really mind when somebody else won. Within the film's moral scheme, this means that Matt is hopelessly out of synch with any of the cutthroat people who might hire him. When he does land a job, it's that of playing chauffeur to Burke Adler, who can drive his own BMW but doesn't like to park. ""I'm all alone,"" Burke says to himself, while Matt is at the wheel. ""At least there's that.""As the film gets going, Matt takes on an added responsibility: care of his 6-year-old daughter, Jeannie (Whittni Wright), whose mother (Tracey Ullman, doing an uncanny Holly Hunter impersonation) is, in her own words, ""going to help others who need her for a few years."" (Translation: jail.) Jeannie is nominally Matt's child, but she may just be the demonic offspring of the movie community. Tough, scheming and manipulatively adorable, Jeannie makes a terrifyingly perfect show-biz kid. Starting out as one more reason for her father's helplessness, Jeannie ultimately prompts Matt to take back control of his life. The father-daughter sections of ""I'll Do Anything"" are slower and less assured than the film's satirical scenes; it may be that the music was meant to play a larger role here. The film's real center is at the offices of Popcorn Pictures, Burke's production company, where the Terminator 2 video game in the waiting room may just say everything about the employees and their ambitions. Among Burke's professional coterie are Nan Mulhanney (Julie Kavner), the movie pollster whose antidepressants and nutritional supplements have combined to form a mysterious truth serum. ""I'm here,"" she tells Burke after they become romantically involved, ""for the same reason that 86 percent of older women loved 'Beauty and the Beast.' ""Also at the production company is Cathy Breslow (played slyly and subtly by Joely Richardson), who would be terrific at evaluating screenplays if she had any idea what her own opinions were. It is Cathy who establishes this film's moral coordinates, and she does it with as much quiet shock value as William Hurt's character did when he faked tears on-camera in ""Broadcast News."" Once again, a film by Mr. Brooks seems to meander all over the map until its closing scenes crystallize the director's vision. Cathy's small, perfect betrayal of Matt, with whom she has become involved, brings the whole film sharply into focus. Bubbling unobtrusively through ""I'll Do Anything"" are some wonderfully satirical ingredients, touches that are no less scathingly hilarious than anything in ""The Player,"" despite the comparative gentleness of Mr. Brooks's style. There's no small irony in the fact that Cathy, a decidedly non-Capraesque person, dreams of remaking ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."" (You can bet that half the staff of Popcorn Pictures would name Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as a sentimental favorite.) There is the progressive dumbing-down of a bad new television show. There are occasional references to Oliver Stone's plans to direct a comedy. There is whispered advice, to an actor preparing to audition: ""Just be yourself, but remember to smile.""There are Burke's surroundings: a bathroom full of hair conditioners, a bed like a giant playpen, an office wall carefully displaying a rack of baseball jackets. (Along with Michael Ballhaus's warmly seductive cinematography, Stephen J. Lineweaver's production design deserves special mention.) And there is Burke himself, the irresistibly funny embodiment of modern Hollywood at its most monstrous. Where Mr. Nolte's performance is sturdy and reactive, Mr. Brooks is simply outrageous, barking out all the terrible thoughts in which his character so honestly believes. Albert Brooks, who steals this movie, isn't linked to the director by blood, but in spirit they are certainly related.""I'll Do Anything"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild profanity, satirical violence, sexual situations and brief nudity. I'll Do Anything Written and directed by James L.

It's a tempting thought, given Mr. Shore's track record as a smug, irritating neo-hippie character on screen. But in his third starring role (after ""Encino Man"" and ""The Son-in-Law"") Mr. Shore plays it relatively straight. As Bones Conway, a failed video salesman, Mr. Shore is seen enlisting in the Army Reserve, getting his head shaved and ending up on the battlefield. Believe it or not, he's supposed to be a leader of men. Putting Mr. Shore under the authority of a pretty female drill sergeant (Lynn Whitfield) is, along with that bad haircut, one of this film's only ways of getting laughs. It's not exactly sure-fire. (Bones: ""Let's not fight -- c'mere!"") Neither is the vulture-in-the-desert sight gag that recalls ""Ishtar,"" a much funnier film than this. Playing a reasonably smart, competent character this time, Mr. Shore winds up losing much of his novelty value. Complacent as he seems, he does have a distinctive approach to playing dim-witted. And dimness is very big this year. But Bones and his buddy, Jack Kaufman (Andy Dick), don't have enough to be spectacularly stupid about here, even if they do mix up slogans for the Navy, the Marines and the Energizer Bunny. Not even Bones's explanation of why he signed up for a water-purification unit (because it sounded like being a pool man) is loopy enough. Too often, Mr. Shore just winds up affecting foxy diffidence, very like Bill Murray's manner in ""Stripes."" ""Stripes"" was funnier, too.""In the Army Now,"" directed by Daniel Petrie Jr. (""Toy Soldiers""), uses up all of its quirky energy during an opening half-hour that sets up the premise; once Bones and his unit reach the desert, there's not much left for them to do. The diversity of this four-member group is established by David Alan Grier, giving a scene-stealing performance as a scaredy-cat dentist, and Lori Petty, a supposedly tough female soldier who winds up finding Bones adorable and wearing her T-shirt as a halter top. Arab soldiers seen in the film are presented as witless caricatures, with one even managing to get stepped on by his camel. Those looking for political subtext in a Pauly Shore film may also be interested in this comedy's gently mocking, mostly admiring outlook on military life.""In the Army Now"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes profanity and sexual suggestiveness.

At the Strand - The New York Times,"at the Strand, to be specific—and that should be good news for those who can enjoy unrefined comedy. This corner can. But, though, one may be an easy mark for the old ""schnozzola's"" mugging and clowning, the line must be drawn when considering ""You're in the Army Now,"" for seldom has there been such a conglomerate slapstick mess. The Warners should not be encouraged to carry this type of painfully embarrassing nonsense any farther. The only thing missing in this antic about a couple of vacuum cleaner salesmen who become unwitting soldiers in Uncle Sam's draftee army is the custard pies that Mr. Sennett used to toss about. But wait! doesn't Mr. Durante find convenient substitutes in the pile of lemons he has to squeeze for the camp social? Indeed, and they splatter over Sergeant Joe Sawyer almost as effectively as a custard filling would. No, the Warners haven't overlooked any of the old tricks—Mr. Durante even flounders about in a mud hole with the colonel after a wild ride in a runaway tank. That tank ride is, however, crazy enough to be reasonably funny. Most of the gags are as obvious as they are corny, but Mr. Durante and Phil Silvers are not to be denied altogether and do manage to eke out a few mild laughs strictly on their own.

Review/Film: In The Line of Fire; Eastwood Slips Easily Into Town - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from July 9, 1993, Section C, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. CLINT EASTWOOD'S timing is uncanny. After all the noise and hot air attending the releases of the somewhat less than perfect ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Last Action Hero"" and ""The Firm,"" he slips into town, almost modestly, giving the ""True Grit"" performance of his career in the most uproariously entertaining movie of the summer so far.""In the Line of Fire"" is not exactly ""Potemkin."" It's movie making of the high, smooth, commercial order that Hollywood prides itself on but achieves with singular infrequency. Mr. Eastwood's charcoal-mellowed persona lends ""In the Line of Fire"" its tone and class. He is the movie's spine. At the same time, note should also be made of those who gave the film its shape: Jeff Maguire, who wrote the original screenplay based on an idea by Jeff Apple, the producer, and Wolfgang Petersen, the German-born director of ""Das Boot,"" who has finally found an American property to equal his earlier international success.""In the Line of Fire"" is the kind of movie that gives teamwork a good name. Taking the remnants of a dozen other movies, this team has concocted a suspense melodrama so satisfying that its cliches, which keep it zipping forward, become epiphanies: by the time you reach the end and look back, everything makes sense. There are very few movies this summer about which that can be said with a straight face. Mr. Eastwood's role would appear to have been made to order, although he has a way of inhabiting his roles so completely that it's never easy to tell where the writing leaves off and he begins. He plays Frank Horrigan, self-described as ""a white, piano-playing male over the age of 50,"" while he may be over 60 in fact. His age makes no difference to the audience (he looks agelessly great), but it's a major factor in the film. Frank is a Secret Service agent who probably should have retired some time ago but can't. His job has become his life since it caused his split from his wife and family. He's the sort of guy who winds up each day in a favorite cocktail bar, noodling on the piano, drinking too much Jack Daniels. (Jack Daniels isn't mentioned in the film, but Frank would be a brand-name drinker.) He also has a secret. On one of his first assignments 30 years ago, Frank was a member of the Secret Service detail that did not prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas. Frank is haunted by the memory of that failure and by the question he keeps asking himself: would he have had the courage or instinct to throw himself between the President and the bullet if he had had that split-second opportunity?When first met, Frank and his young partner, Al D'Andrea (Dylan McDermott), are working on routine if dangerous assignments relating to counterfeiters and such. During an investigation of a man who seems obsessed by Presidential assassinations, Frank suspects that the fellow is not a crackpot but someone with a seriously deranged mind. This suspicion is confirmed when the man begins to telephone Frank at all hours to chat about his plans to kill the President, and to make sarcastic comments about Frank's behavior as part of the Dallas motorcade. He either knows Frank, has studied him or has access to his agency files. Frank alerts his superiors and asks that he and Al be assigned to the Presidential security team.""In the Line of Fire"" is the story of Frank's efforts to identify and stop the would-be killer, who stalks him with malicious joy as he stalks the President in earnest. It's also the story of Frank's need to prove himself. Finally, though not least, it's the story of his hilarious September-May affair with Lilly Raines (Rene Russo), a beautiful, much younger agent also assigned to the President's security. Lilly is as odd as Frank. She knows she must be nuts to fall for this dinosaur. When she tells him, ""Let's face it, Frank, you're too old,"" it's as much to convince herself as it is to persuade him that he ought to retire gracefully and not mess up other people's lives, including hers.""In the Line of Fire"" also has a first-rate villain in Mitch Leary, played by John Malkovich with the same insinuating mixture of wit and malevolence that the actor brought to his New York stage performance in Sam Shepard's ""True West."" Mr. Malkovich eases into the film in a kind of slither. First he's a voice on the telephone, then an eye, a nose, a face seen in a pore-tight close-up. When finally seen in full figure, he appears to be both maniacal and utterly ordinary. The screenplay does well by both Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Malkovich, especially in their telephone exchanges in which Mitch delights in sending up the Secret Service man while the rest of the agency is frantically trying to trace the call. Mitch constantly questions Frank's sincerity about being willing to give his life to protect the President's. Mitch acknowledges that his will be a suicide mission.""I have a rendezvous with death,"" he tells Frank, dramatizing himself with the self-consciousness of a first-year English major. When Frank indicates that he recognizes the Alan Seeger lines, Mitch can't resist setting Frank straight about literature: ""It's really not a good poem, Frank.""There is equal intelligence in Mr. Petersen's direction of the action sequences, beginning with the film's scarily funny opening in which the arrest of some counterfeiters goes dangerously wrong. ""In the Line of Fire"" is so neatly constructed that even though Frank and Mitch confront each other quite early, the tension of the virtually movie-long chase does not let up until the end. One pursuit across the rooftops of Washington is as elegantly staged as it is brutal and revealing of character. Although the film moves at a dizzy pace from Washington to Los Angeles to Chicago and back again, there are no false moves. Nor does the audience ever get lost.""In the Line of Fire"" is one of the few Hollywood suspense melodramas that don't seem to ignore the realities of the world outside. It uses them. It's not really vital to the narrative, but it helps, that the film takes place during the final weeks of a President's campaign for re-election. Because he is trailing at the polls, his handlers put him in jeopardy that at any other time would be unthinkable. The campaign in ""In the Line of Fire"" isn't about issues and ideas, but about the naked wish to win. Sound familiar?Ms. Russo, who played Mel Gibson's battle-scarred lover in ""Lethal Weapon 3,"" works terrifically well with Mr. Eastwood. Their scenes have some of the caustic spirit of the material Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin used to write for Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. They are genuinely funny lovers. Mr. McDermott is also very good as Al, Frank's partner, a guy who remains unconvinced that he's cut out for the only kind of work that makes his friend feel alive. Commanding the film but never getting in the way of it is Mr. Eastwood. His Frank is as obsessed as Mr. Malkovich's assassin, but also easy and self-aware, cool and amused. This is the richest performance yet by an actor who, among other things, keeps getting better and better.""In the Line of Fire"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes vulgar language and a lot of violence. In the Line of Fire Directed by Wolfgang Petersen; written by Jeff Maguire; director of photography, John Bailey; edited by Anne V.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""Mr. Wonderful"" finds Matt Dillon playing Gus, a Con Edison electrical worker, and Annabella Sciorra playing Lee, Gus's ex-wife, who left him none too amicably and is now a college student. ""Somebody please explain to me how I get into a situation where my ex-husband is finding me dates!"" Lee cries exasperatedly at one point. Indeed, it would have been nice if the screenplay had explained that, since the dating gimmick becomes all too central to the plot. ""Mr. Wonderful"" is well cast and convincingly played, but its actors are hamstrung by the cute excesses of the story. Gus is supposedly eager to marry off Lee so that he can stop paying alimony and sink his money into an abandoned bowling alley he plans to refurbish, with the help of four equally handy friends. Even viewers who buy that idea will have a hard time understanding why Gus and Lee, who supposedly hate each other, can spend so much time conspiring over Lee's social life. Lee has been seeing her English professor (William Hurt) and Gus has an adoring girlfriend, a nurse named Rita (Mary-Louise Parker). So in theory these ex-spouses are otherwise engaged. But it's clear from the start that the film itself will mimic Gus's matchmaking tricks, and that the secondary players will be manipulated more and more arbitrarily as Amy Schor and Vicki Polon's screenplay moves along. By its last reel, ""Mr. Wonderful"" has become so crazily abrupt that it injures Gus badly enough to land him in the hospital, just so that he and Rita can be thrown together. As directed by Anthony Minghella (""Truly, Madly, Deeply""), ""Mr. Wonderful"" does offer a captivatingly romantic view of New York. The city is made to seem amazingly bucolic, and it also becomes a place filled with colorful Con Edison work sites. (One of the film's typically cute flourishes has two minor characters having sex inside a Con Ed manhole.) But the story goes over the top when Gus grills every eligible-looking electrical worker on the 59th Street Bridge about his marital status, the better to find takers for Lee. As played by the always warmly down-to-earth Ms. Sciorra, Lee looks like she can manage just fine on her own. Several of the performances run much deeper than the material, particularly Mr. Hurt's odd, uneasy turn as a married professor who affects a deliberately superficial air in seducing his student. Ms. Parker is especially good as a sweet, wishful young woman whose skittishness seems to indicate some fundamental pessimism behind her smile. Also in the film, and unfortunately wasted, is Vincent D'Onofrio as the pharmacist who falls hard for Lee, proclaiming himself ""completely gaga"" about her. No actor could make that phrase sound right. Among the film's artifically snappy little extras is a couple who meet through a matchmaking ad (the title comes from this), an elevator full of strangers who give Gus advice, and a moment when the wives of Gus's buddies advise Rita to cry on gnocchi in order to win his love. The actors are at their most impressive when they make themselves lifelike at moments like these.""Mr. Wonderful"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

WONDERFUL' - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from December 21, 1983, Section C, Page 26Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

THE German director Peter Lilienthal has filmed ''Dear Mr. Wonderful'' on what, for him at least, is alien territory. The film is set in New York and Jersey City, yet it has a fascinatingly incongruous European texture. Mr. Lilienthal's film, which opens at the Film Forum today, isn't always succinct, but even when it drifts it does so in intriguing ways.''Dear Mr. Wonderful'' is the story of Ruby Dennis, owner of a bowling alley-plus-nightclub called Ruby's Palace. As played by Joe Pesci (who wears a conspicuously terrible toupee for the role), Ruby is a man who genuinely believes in the things he loves, even though the thing he loves best - nightclub singing - is something not everyone would view so sentimentally. Much as his ''Raging Bull'' co-star Robert De Niro did in ''The King of Comedy,'' Mr. Pesci plays a man who's got a little piece of show business where his heart ought to be. The film watches Ruby progress toward a spiritual crisis of some delicacy, a breakdown that is somewhat out of keeping with the realm in which he travels. It also traces developments in the lives of a large number of supporting characters, from the nephew (Evan Handler) heading gradually toward crime, to the sister (Karen Ludwig) who finds a new and more satisfying life by creating a partial rupture with her family. Mr. Lilienthal brings a powerful sense of family and community to these characters. They seem to exist in a smaller, friendlier, more reflective world than that of Ruby's Palace, even though the ambience of the bowling- alley bistro is used very effectively by the director. There are a number of touches to the film that don't ring quite true but are compelling for their very incongruity. For instance, when Ruby takes an interest in an aspiring singer named Sharon (Ivy Ray Browning), and they meet for a meal, Sharon asks whether Ruby has brought enough food. ''I eat a lot, that's all,'' she says, with an utterly disarming, slow smile. Miss Browning seems so simply and naturally voluptuous here that it hardly matters whether another, more authentic Sharon would really say such a thing. Mr. Lilienthal has assembled an excellent and very natural cast, and the performances give the film an authenticity it otherwise might lack. Mr. Pesci makes a credible and touching Ruby, and he doesn't sing badly at all. Miss Ludwig brings a lot of vitality to the role of Ruby's beleaguered sister. Though a subplot about the future of the bowling alley is less effectively staged than some of the domestic scenes, the ambience of Ruby's Palace is vividly rendered. A guest appearance from Tony Martin, who make a brief visit to the nightclub and then goes out to bowl while Ruby is singing, also contributes to the film's odd but genuine immediacy.

"Review/Film: Mrs. Doubtfire; A Wig, a Dress and Voila! Dad Becomes the Nanny - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from November 24, 1993, Section C, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is about a man who dresses as a dowager to invade the household of his estranged wife, who has thrown him out. The movie's biggest challenge, one that it does not exactly meet, is to persuade the audience that this husband and father's escapade is somehow an act of love. Fortunately, Robin Williams lurks behind that latex face mask, ready to scatter wicked jokes and brilliant non sequiturs about whatever crosses his mind. Mr. Williams's genius is in these details, and it is given free rein during much of ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" as in the sequence that has him improvising with toy dinosaurs at a television studio and coming up with a Raptor Rap. (""Yo, yo, see me/I'm livin' below the soil/I'll be back/But I'm comin' as oil."") But if this film creates as good a showcase for the Williams zaniness as anything short of ""Aladdin,"" it also spends too much time making nice. And not enough time making sense. A lot of trouble has gone into giving a sitcom shininess to ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" which was directed by Chris Columbus (who also did both ""Home Alone"" films). Attention has been paid to everything from the sunny, well-heeled look of the family household to the pert costumes on Sally Field, who plays Mr. Williams's careerist wife. The story is so simple-minded that the wife's job alone is enough to villainize her: Miranda Hillard (Ms. Field) is seen doing something terribly important involving fabric swatches, while her sweet, helpless husband, Daniel (Mr. Williams), can barely stay employed dubbing voices onto animated films. When Miranda complains about his childishness, kicks him out of the house and keeps him from seeing enough of their three children, Daniel remains much too good-hearted to sue for support. Conveniently, Daniel has a brother (Harvey Fierstein, tart and funny here) who specializes in makeup effects. And naturally Daniel is an actor, just as Dustin Hoffman's character was in the funnier, more substantial ""Tootsie,"" which unavoidably comes to mind. That film made the most of its hero's hostility, allowing it to become part of the joke. This one insists on a veneer of good intentions, which wears thin long before the story culminates in a speech about families and love. Once the screenplay, by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon, has accomplished the gargantuan job of getting Daniel into a dress (so that he can play nanny to his own children), it stops adding up. There's a sequence about how Daniel, now done up as the broad-backed, hairy-legged matron of the title, can't cook dinner for the children, even though he has been feeding and caring for them for years. There are also two separate episodes, one elaborately staged in a restaurant, when Daniel must become a quick-change artist and jump into and out of his Doubtfire drag. No audience will believe he can do this in a few seconds' time. The film keeps busy by finding Miranda a handsome chump of a boyfriend (Pierce Brosnan), who becomes a fine target for Daniel's insults and the subject of Mrs. Doubtfire's motherly advice to Miranda. (""Once the father of your children is out of the picture, the only solution is lifelong celibacy,"" the nanny says sweetly.) It also lets Daniel's son (Matthew Lawrence) catch his father in the bathroom and discover his disguise, asking nervously: ""You don't really like wearing that stuff, do you, Dad?"" Even then, the comic possibilities posed by letting the children in on the joke are never explored. Mr. Williams remains this film's main and only real attraction (although Ms. Field tries gamely to generate sitcom-caliber sparks). He is well worth seeing whatever he's wearing, but he's most fun in an anarchic mode, threatening to blow the film's illusions wide open. The dress, the mask and Mrs. Doubtfire's gentility are inherently limiting, but nothing holds Mr. Williams back when he's on a roll. You may not believe he could pass for a woman, but you'll want to see what he can do with a vacuum cleaner all the same.""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned.) It includes plenty of off-color asides that should go over the heads of small children.

"Review: Ethan Hawke Is Just Right as a ’90s Indie-Rocker in ‘Juliet, Naked’ - The New York Times","in which, just so you know, there is no nudity and nobody named Juliet — marks a milestone in the interminable Generation-X midlife crisis. Ethan Hawke becomes a grandpa. Is that a spoiler? A shocker? An occasion for tears? For schadenfreude?Let me clarify. I don’t mean simply that the character Mr. Hawke plays — an initially enigmatic, eventually pathetic, finally endearing musician named Tucker Crowe — is the begetter of a begetter. That’s just acting. The thing is that Tucker is one of those invented personages who partakes of the cultural mojo of his portrayer. He released a seminal album in 1993, the year before Mr. Hawke’s appearance in the seminal “Reality Bites.” It is Mr. Hawke’s (quite credible) voice that we hear in Tucker’s old hits and lost demos, and his angular, youthful, beautiful visage that we glimpse in fake-vintage posters and publicity photos. At least on the level of casting, “Juliet, Naked,” directed by Jesse Peretz (“Our Idiot Brother”) and based on Nick Hornby’s novel, seems designed to make some of us feel old. It also made this aging ’90s dude feel a wee bit grumpy. This is not the fault of Mr. Hawke, nor of Chris O’Dowd and Rose Byrne, who play the other sides of a romantic triangle taking shape in the English coastal town of Sandcliff. They are all charming. The film’s reference points, invented and otherwise, are faultlessly deployed. “The Wire” is evoked in an academic setting, with the obligatory Dickens and Shakespeare name-checks wrapped in several layers of eye-rolling self-consciousness. Pop songs are cued in with gentle irony and winsome sincerity. Vintage T-shirts are worn the same way. It me, as the kids say. Like “High Fidelity,” still the definitive distillation, on page and screen, of Mr. Hornby’s genial cool-guy sensibility, “Juliet, Naked” hinges on an affectionately critical view of musical obsession. Annie (Ms. Byrne), a curator at a provincial museum formerly run by her father, lives with Duncan (Mr. O’Dowd), a lecturer in cinema and the world’s biggest Tucker Crowe fan. He runs a website devoted to his idol — a bit of a digital throwback to the book’s 2009 setting, though the movie seems to take place in the present — and pays more attention to his fellow online Croweheads than to Annie. The malaise in their 15-year relationship reaches a crisis after Duncan comes by a bootleg CD of acoustic versions of the songs on “Juliet,” Tucker’s legendary breakup album and the last thing he released before dropping out of sight. Annie posts a negative review on Duncan’s site, and then hears from the artist himself. They strike up an email flirtation, which simmers for a while as 25 years’ worth of blank space in Tucker’s life is crosshatched in. He has been collecting exes and producing offspring, growing gray and shaggy and looking after his son Jackson (Azhy Robertson) while living in Jackson’s mother’s garage. Circumstances bring Tucker and Jackson to London and then to Sandcliff. Duncan, who has screwed things up pretty badly with Annie, discovers that his hero is now his rival. Mr. Peretz and the screenwriters (Evgenia Peretz, the director’s sister, is credited along with Tamara Jenkins and Jim Taylor) find an amiable farcical groove, and the actors embrace the ridiculousness of the circumstances without overdoing it. Tucker’s impromptu performance of the Kinks’ “Waterloo Sunset” is a high point of sweetness and absurdity, and Mr. Hawke gets it just right. But the abundant, generally on-target sociological details and comic observations feel overdone and superficial, like an elaborately patterned rug laid over an unfinished floor. Annie’s romantic dilemma may be the center of “Juliet, Naked,” but Annie herself is a thinly conceived character, sketched with gallant protectiveness rather than psychological insight. The men in her life are complicated, difficult, at times impossibly selfish and obtuse, but they are permitted to be interesting in ways that she is not. There is something tiresome and incurious about the film’s romanticism, which rests on the canard that girls aren’t really into music. They like musicians and babies — and having babies with musicians — but don’t share in either the creative passion that motivates Tucker or the ardent devotion that occupies Duncan. The fact that this is presented as a compliment, as evidence of female superiority, doesn’t make it better. The guys are kind of childish, and Annie and most of the other women in the movie are much more sensible and mature, but it’s still the dudes who demand most of the attention, and the women who are expected to derive satisfaction from granting it. I bet someone from my generation could make a great record about that.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/movies/juliet-naked-review-ethan-hawke.html
Review: ‘A Poem Is a Naked Person’ Is a Jam Session of a Documentary - The New York Times,"a documentary made in the early ’70s and now receiving a belated and welcome United States theatrical release — Leon Russell is an enigma wrapped in a mystery and wearing his signature top hat. With silver hair and an air of sagacity belying his youth at the time (he was born in 1942), Mr. Russell seems to have sprung from the commingled imaginations of J. R. R. Tolkien and Mark Twain. He’s a wizard and a mountebank, an old-timey song-and-dance man dabbling in ancient magic. This film, commissioned by Mr. Russell and directed by Les Blank, is among other things a strange and gorgeous artifact of its moment. Happily indifferent to the conventions of its genre, it’s neither the record of a concert nor a talking-head-driven biography. Some wonderful performances are captured — from a clean-shaven Willie Nelson and a bewitching fiddler named Sweet Mary Egan — and a lot of grandiose wisdom is dropped, but Mr. Blank is more dreamer than journalist, less interested in empirical information than in intuitive and ecstatic forms of truth. The result is a poetic exploration of a moment, a place and an artist. Mr. Russell and his colleagues are recording and performing in Oklahoma, and as their music evokes an eclectic, regionally specific set of traditions — country and western, rhythm and blues, string bands and gospel choirs — Mr. Blank’s camera and sound equipment capture the faces and voices of local residents. Filmed over three years, “A Poem Is a Naked Person” was Mr. Blank’s first feature, and a vital part of a unique and durable body of work. Perhaps best known for “Burden of Dreams,” a chronicle of cinematic folly and artistic ambition featuring his friend Werner Herzog, Mr. Blank, who died in 2013, was a playful, disciplined observer of creativity and the pursuit of pleasure. (“Always for Pleasure” is the name of one of his films.) He made movies about music, food and dance, but “about” doesn’t do justice to his vision and sensibility. “A Poem Is a Naked Person” is a collaboration between filmmaker and subject, a sprawling, easily distracted jam session in which the camera functions as part of the ensemble. Not everyone who appears on screen is identified, and quite a bit goes unexplained. The mellow vibe is occasionally disrupted by some heavier stuff, like a testy encounter between Mr. Russell and the singer-songwriter Eric Andersen and a fatal encounter between a chicken and a snake. The meeting of Mr. Russell and Mr. Blank is more fortunate, and the audience has the pleasure of watching each man find his groove.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/movies/review-a-poem-is-a-naked-person-is-a-jam-session-of-a-documentary.html
"‘Naked Opera,’ a Documentary Profile by Angela Christlieb - The New York Times","Over 10 years ago, in the documentary “Cinemania,” Angela Christlieb and Stephen Kijak profiled a few obsessive New York moviegoers, cranky and snobbish devotees of the city’s bountiful repertory cinemas. With “Naked Opera,” Ms. Christlieb gives us another eccentric fanatic in Marc Rollinger, a man of mysterious means from Luxembourg who spends his cash on “Don Giovanni” performances across Europe and on a succession of what seem to be male escorts. Squat, jowly and preppily dressed, Mr. Rollinger cuts an impatient, sarcastic figure, freely condescending about Ms. Christlieb’s ideas for staging shoots. His privileged lifestyle yields some of the gawking and grimacing appeal of the under-seen documentary “Born Rich,” on heirs to great fortunes. Here, Ms. Christlieb takes a mostly mocking view, making sure to show us Mr. Rollinger’s compulsive collection of bookkeeping binders and his finicky hotel selections. But the man’s fear over a recent bout with cancer makes all this hedonism feel like a desperate grab for earthly pleasures. Cutaways to a filmed performance of “Don Giovanni” seem to suggest that his travels are a travesty of that opera, especially when he takes up with the pornographic film star Jordan Fox, who lies about and preens in sumptuous hotel rooms like some sort of sex pet. But Mr. Rollinger, a protagonist of a curiously circumscribed life, proves to have an opaque appeal.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/movies/naked-opera-a-documentary-profile-by-angela-christlieb.html
"‘The Naked Room,’ Filmed in a Psychiatrist’s Office - The New York Times","in many cases, calm and collected — yet hear what they think of themselves. Ms. Ibáñez has a background in journalism, but there’s a conceptual rigor to the movie’s restrictions on information and space that seems suited to a studied avant-garde filmmaker. Viewed one way, “The Naked Room” is a kind of educational film, lifting a stigma on diagnosing mental illness in children. On the other hand, it feels invasive. The decision to forgo context could be seen as a necessary preservation of privacy or an irresponsible omission, depending on your perspective. Exposing deep secrets to a physician is not the same as sharing them with a movie audience. While “The Naked Room” may raise awareness, it often feels voyeuristic in less productive ways.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/movies/the-naked-room-filmed-in-a-psychiatrists-office.html
"‘The Girl From the Naked Eye,’ a Noirish Martial Arts Movie - The New York Times","There’s a lot to like about the action film “The Girl From the Naked Eye,” especially some crisp martial arts fight sequences and the subtle sense of humor that surfaces now and then. But the filmmakers make a mistake in telling the story via flashback and a voice-over by Jason Yee, who plays Jake, the main character. As graceful as Mr. Yee is in those fights, he proves that delivering a compelling voice-over is harder than it seems. The movie is trying for noir, but Jake mostly sounds awkward talking us through his efforts to avenge the killing of Sandy (Samantha Streets), an under-age prostitute for whom he developed a soft spot while working as her driver. Jake took that job to pay off a foolishly incurred debt, and it puts him in the midst of an underworld centered on a club called the Naked Eye, where men connect with escorts like Sandy. Apart from the voice-over, Mr. Yee makes a pretty good vigilante, and the script (written by Mr. Yee; David Ren, who directed; and Larry Madill) features some unconventional choices that give the film a distinct personality. The chief villain ought to be a man named Simon, who books Sandy and the other women, but Ron Yuan plays him with a likability that keeps things refreshingly off-kilter. Mr. Yuan also directed the fight sequences. One of those, staged in a narrow hallway, is a particular gem. “The Girl From the Naked Eye” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has moments of nudity and gore.",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/movies/the-girl-from-the-naked-eye-a-noirish-martial-arts-movie.html
Swinging Singers - The New York Times,"and the gay lifestyle — with playful wit and unabashed explicitness. Sound quality is excellent; whether extolling the delights of a bris or the anxiety of a high-school locker room, every penile synonym rings clear. Quiet moments are few; the heartfelt emotion in “Kris Look What You Missed” — and in the lovely voice of Jaymes Hodges — is a welcome oasis between bouts of antic phallocentrism. Yet “Naked Boys Singing!,” with its complete lack of sleaze, is more likely to have you pondering the cast members’ skin care routines than their vital statistics. And though stage shows are always best experienced in their natural habitat, few will benefit as much as this one from the eventual consolations of “pause” and “zoom.” NAKED BOYS SINGING! Opens today in Manhattan. Directed by Troy Christian and Robert Schrock; music director, Stephen Bates; staged and choreographed by Mr. Christian; conceived by Mr. Schrock; music and lyrics by Shelley Markham, David Pevsner, Mark Savage, Rayme Sciaroni, Mark Winkler, Marie Cain, Binyumen (Ben) Schaechter, with additional lyrics by Bruce Vilanch; directors of photography, Jerry L.

FILM IN REVIEW; 'Barenaked in America' - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from September 29, 2000, Section E, Page 16Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Directed by Jason PriestleyNot rated; 90 minutesReaders who are not knowledgeable about pop music ought to know a couple of things about the group called Barenaked Ladies. When they perform, they are clothed. And at all times they are men. Barenaked Ladies is a Canadian band that started on the streets of Toronto and in the course of a decade built a devoted following with an ingratiating combination of rock, jazz and folk music; plenty of good-natured humor, intelligence and an unpretentious attitude. As one of their fans says in the new documentary ''Barenaked in America,'' ''They look like guys you see working in the Gap.''''Barenaked in America,'' directed by Jason Priestly, best known as the actor who played Brandon Walsh in ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' is an unabashed valentine to the band, which consists of Ed Robertson and Steven Page, who sing and play guitars; Jim Creeggan, who sings and plays double bass and bass guitar; Kevin Hearn, who plays keyboards, accordion, electric guitar and sings; and Tyler Stewart, who plays drums and sings. The film, which opens today at the Loews State (Broadway at 45th Street), has cameo appearances by the comedian Jon Stewart, the actor Jeff Goldblum and the television host Conan O'Brien and many a jocular reference to Canada's cornucopia of show-business talent. It follows the Barenaked Ladies on a tour of the United States as the band attempts to raise its visibility south of the border. So, as the group plays places like Buffalo, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston and New York, the camera documents its members individually and collectively, in performance and behind the scenes, and as they deal with Mr. Hearn's battle with leukemia. From time to time, their business associates and experts on Canadian pop music discuss the talent and career arc of Barenaked Ladies, but the band and its music are the principal focus.''Barenaked in America'' may not be dispassionate filmmaking, but it is certainly entertaining.

Imagine the erotic world of ""Basic Instinct"" exaggerated into a kung-fu cartoon of sexy lesbian avengers executing quadruple leaping somersaults in a deadly assault against the opposite sex. Their campaign of assassination involves not only murder, but castration and genital mutilation as well. For all its sexual provocation, the movie, directed by Clarence Fok, fits squarely within Hong Kong's giddy action-adventure genre, which is a cinematic world unto itself. The gore, like the absurdly speeded-up, impossibly balletic martial arts sequences, is transparently fake, and the caricatured soft-core sex utterly devoid of body heat. There is no place for character in a live-action cartoon that hurtles forward at the speed of light. What makes ""Naked Killer,"" which opens today at Cinema Village, special is its psychosexual sense of humor. Its detective hero, Tinam (Simon Yam), has been impotent since accidentally killing his brother in a shootout and literally vomits every time he picks up a gun. While investigating a series of murders whose victims were sexually mutilated, he senses that Kitty (Chingmy Yau), his leading suspect, holds the key to his recovery. Kitty is torn between Tinam and the band of female assassins led by the elegant, middle-aged Sister Cindy (Svenwara Madoka), who instructs her in murder and sexual torture. The plot thickens as Princess (Carrie Ng), a jealous former student of Sister Cindy, schemes to murder her ex-mentor, then have her way with Kitty, before killing her, too. Beware of beautiful women with poisoned lipstick, the movie warns. It would be foolish to read too much meaning into a film that is one long hooting joke at Hollywood formulas and sexual stereotypes. But it must be counted as some sort of accomplishment that ""Naked Killer"" can treat its subject so lightly that the sex and violence seem as innocent and playful as an extended pillow fight.

Review/Film; A New York Comedy With Heart and Barbs - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from April 15, 1994, Section C, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. In directing his first feature, ""Naked in New York,"" about how hard it is to be an aspiring young playwright, Dan Algrant manages to make film making look wonderfully easy. Mr. Algrant's agile, self-deprecating wit and his flair for ensemble comedy make ""Naked in New York"" as knowing and clever as it is charming. Although the film maker is a protege of Martin Scorsese (Mr. Scorsese served as executive producer), his dry, offbeat style recalls someone else. ""Naked in New York"" is descended, in the most funny and refreshing way, from ""Annie Hall.""The resemblance goes well beyond the fact that this film's hero, Jake Briggs (Eric Stoltz), is a bespectacled, red-haired fellow who tends to worry a lot. Or that his girlfriend, Joanne White (Mary-Louise Parker), is a sly, winsome neurotic who never fully says what's on her mind. ""Naked in New York"" also ponders the problems of trying to combine love and work, the lure of ambition and the terrors posed by any prospect of permanent commitment. And none of it is made to look easy. When Jake is a little boy, he is seen coaching his mother (Jill Clayburgh) with the phrase, ""I am the master of my emotions,"" which turns out to be a hearty joke for them both. At 25, Jake approaches all his worries with appealing nonchalance, as when he begins the film by saying: ""One of the few things that I know about life, other than that it ends, is that it's a good idea to be with someone during it. Preferably someone you love."" Mr. Algrant, who wrote the film with John Warren, doesn't overburden such lightweight observations, but his film is more thoughtful than it initially sounds. Its characters remain ruefully perceptive about one another even when the pressures of love and work threaten to drive them far apart.""Naked in New York"" is loosely narrated by Jake, whose memories have a suitably antic quality; he can recall himself as a baby, on the lazy susan at a table in a Chinese restaurant, on the day his parents split up. Later, Jake recalls living in Cambridge, Mass., across the street from a nut factory (""driving the local squirrels mad from the constant roasting""), and falling in love with Joanne. At the same time, he makes his first stab at playwriting with a short piece about a homicidal lumberjack. A teacher (Roscoe Lee Browne) praises his craftsmanship, but adds: ""On a personal level, I think you might want to go talk with someone in health services.""Jake is coaxed from Boston to New York by his friend Chris (Ralph Macchio), an aspiring actor, who thinks breaking into the theater depends on being where the action is. Meanwhile, Joanne is hired by Elliot Price (Timothy Dalton) to work at his art gallery. Overnight, she begins looking as if she loves her work a little too well. One of the film's nervier sequences has Elliot flying Jake and Joanne to Martha's Vineyard on his private plane (""Why is Patsy Cline playing on the tape? Is that a joke?"" asks a terrified Jake) and including them in a celebrity-packed literary party. ""Before they were movies, I read them,"" Jake manages to say -- flatteringly, he hopes -- to a deadpan William Styron. Mr. Algrant is savvy enough to satirize the idea of celebrity cameos while making sure that his film features them everywhere. David Johansen provides the voice of a helpful orangutan, Eric Bogosian and Quentin Crisp turn up at the same party, and Whoopi Goldberg is part of a talking frieze on the front of a New York theater.""Naked in New York"" deftly divides its attention between Joanne's new life in the art world and Jake's New York theater experiences. (The details are often exactly right; Joanne's favorite photographer isn't Cartier-Bresson, it's Mary Ellen Mark.) In Manhattan, Mr. Algrant has found a particularly fertile setting for his film's brand of urbane humor. His Manhattan fixtures include Tony Curtis, letter-perfect in the role of a lovably crass off-Broadway producer, and Kathleen Turner as a leonine soap opera star who yearns alarmingly for more stage experience. ""She makes the boat float, don't you understand that?"" asks Mr. Curtis, as he insists on miscasting her in Jake's precious play. Mr. Algrant switches gears with impressive ease when he moves from satire to more serious concerns. The film includes a surprising, beautifully acted scene involving a sexual overture made in the midst of a New York party. This gentle encounter is troubling for both parties, and Mr. Algrant captures it with empathy and intelligence: qualities that keep even the zanier moments in ""Naked in New York"" from feeling like fluff.""Naked in New York"" is made even more entertaining by Angelo Badalamenti's inspired score, and by a production design that keeps the film as visually interesting as it is verbally bright. The casting is full of welcome surprises, particularly Mr. Macchio's grown-up performance in a quiet but important role. Mr. Algrant's showier directorial tricks -- swiveling camerawork, occasional fantasy sequences -- sometimes try too hard, but his talent is never in doubt. Even before spring was in the air, this was shaping up as an exceptionally rosy season for ensemble-minded romantic comedy. Along with ""Reality Bites"" and the especially enchanting ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Naked in New York"" qualifies as one more warm, seductive delight.""Naked in New York"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations, profanity and nudity.

Review/Film; Taking Aim At the Oscars And Others Scantily Clad - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from March 18, 1994, Section C, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. There are always priceless moments during the Academy Awards ceremony, those special moments that are impossible to watch with a straight face. After you've seen the big Oscar parody that is the centerpiece of ""Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult,"" when the real thing turns up on Monday night it may be hard to tell the difference. Movies have always been the prime target of the ""Naked Gun"" series, and this time Lieut. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) goes right to the source when he is assigned to thwart a terrorist at the Oscars. The result is a series of wickedly funny scenes, none better than the production number in which Pia Zadora, playing herself, sings and dances to a brassy Las Vegas arrangement of ""This Could Be the Start of Something.""This third installment of the silly and often hilarious send-up of cop cliches is slower to start than the earlier ""Naked Gun"" movies. As always, it is a scattershot mix of throwaway lines, topical references and sight gags (a newspaper headline that reads: ""Dyslexia for Cure Found""). Drebin is now married to Jane (Priscilla Presley). She is a hot-shot lawyer and he is retired, so he cooks and hangs around the house. Mr. Nielsen sets the tone with his authoritative deadpan approach. The key to this series' success is the way he maintains his dignified demeanor without winking at the audience, even when he is wearing fuzzy pink slippers. The plot is a flimsy excuse for new jokes. Drebin's colleagues, played by George Kennedy and O. J. Simpson, lure him back on the job to thwart a gangster named Rocco (Fred Ward), who has a mother (Kathleen Freeman) tougher than he is. Rocco's sexy girlfriend (Anna Nicole Smith) hasn't aged a day since the police squad first set eyes on her in the 1970's; this is evident in a goofy disco flashback. Even before Drebin discovers that a bomb is hidden in one of the Oscar envelopes, ""Naked Gun 33 1/3"" tosses him and his friends into some irresistible scenes that echo ""The Untouchables,"" ""Thelma and Louise"" and ""The Crying Game."" But it is the long Academy Awards ceremony near the end that makes the film worthwhile. The familiar-sounding list of nominees includes movies like ""Fatal Affair,"" ""Fatal Proposal,"" ""Basic Analysis"" and ""Geriatric Park."" Best of all is a short clip from Sir Richard Attenborough's latest epic, a musical biography of Mother Teresa. The film's first-time director, Peter Segal, has adopted the series' style seamlessly. And this ""Naked Gun,"" written by Pat Proft, David Zucker (who directed and co-wrote the earlier installments) and Robert LoCash, keeps some favorite touches. Be sure to stay around until the very end, to find out how Joey Buttafuoco and Marlon Brando slipped into the closing credits.""Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mock violence and mock sex.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Meet Johnny (David Thewlis), the 27-year-old Manchester lad who is the central figure in Mike Leigh's ""Naked,"" a brilliant somersault of a movie that lands this fine English director in dark new cinematic territory. As nothing that Mr. Leigh has done in the past (especially his recent ""High Hopes"" and ""Life Is Sweet"") is adequate preparation for ""Naked,"" no movie character you may have met quite measures up (or down) to the caustic and abusive Johnny. He's ""not waving, but drowning."" Though the cool order of the poet Stevie Smith's line succinctly describes Johnny's situation, it has little to do with his often revivifying, sardonic fury. Johnny recalls Jimmy Porter of ""Look Back in Anger,"" but homeless in the London streets of the 1990's. He raises his fist not at the Empire, the class system and the Tory mentality, but at God: Johnny goes to the source. A product of the English working class, a man with possibly a year or two at a Midlands university behind him, he has the gift of gab of one of James Joyce's Dubliners who has lost his faith but not his voice. Johnny invites compassion, especially from women. His scroungy good looks inspire trust: the sad expression, the skinny frame, the great reddish-brown mustache that indicates some reassuring sense of self-worth. But they're all a disguise. Beneath his cheap raincoat, which provides no protection against the winter chill, Johnny is a kind of satanic angel. He's as capable of expressing love as Jack the Ripper. He doesn't murder; he doesn't have to. During his several days of wanderings about London, which are the focus of Mr. Leigh's screenplay, he leaves a trail of living corpses, the victims, possibly, of a social system but beyond that, of a disinterested universe. He's fed up with himself and his lot, but directs his anger at everyone around him. When a young woman he's about to make love to says she is bored, Johnny, who has nothing but unused time on his hands, becomes lyrical in behalf of small and large mysteries to be pondered.""Naked"" will be shown at the New York Film Festival today at 9:15 P. M. and tomorrow at 3 P. M. It will open here commercially later this year. When I first saw ""Naked,"" at this year's Cannes International Film Festival, where Mr. Leigh received the best-director award and Mr. Thewlis won as the best actor, the film didn't fit easily into the dozen or so Leigh works I already know. It seemed as disconnected from the other Leigh films as its characters are from one another and from the world in which they live. The picture cleared after a second viewing, one without jet lag. The revelation: ""Naked"" not only fits, but is also a logical if unexpected extension of such earlier Leigh films as ""Bleak Moments"" ""Grown-Ups,"" ""Meantime"" and ""Home Sweet Home,"" each a harrowing tale of the domestic problems of the English working and lower-middle classes. Yet those films are all rooted in recognizable homes, such as they may be, and deal with approximations of the nuclear family. ""Naked"" is something else. The characters in ""Naked"" have abandoned whatever homes they had. Their families are somewhere else; they're scarcely mentioned. The flats and rooms we see in ""Naked"" are temporary refuges. These characters aren't mired in domestic relationships; they're as free-floating in limbo as Johnny, though they don't know it. When first seen, before the film's title credits, Johnny is standing in a Manchester alley late at night having sex with a woman he has just picked up. That's a delicate way of describing what he's doing. He's brutalizing the woman, who tries to fight him off. When finished, he walks away, steals a car and drives to London. His purpose: to find his former girlfriend Louise (Lesley Sharp). She shares a flat with a spaced-out druggie named Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge) and Sandra (Claire Skinner), whose name is on the lease, a prissy nurse who returns from a vacation in Zimbabwe in the course of Johnny's visit. During the next several days, Johnny descends into hell, though at one point, when he's asked where he has been, he says ""down the via dolorosa."" Johnny's being sarcastic, but the movie isn't. ""Naked"" is as corrosive and sometimes as funny as anything Mr. Leigh has done to date. It's loaded with wild flights of absurd rhetoric and encounters with characters so eccentric that they seem to have come directly from life. Nobody would dare imagine them. There's the lonely, philosophical night watchman Brian (Peter Wight), who finds Johnny huddled in the doorway and invites him in, not necessarily to be kind but to have someone to talk to. Brian gets more than he bargained for. Says Johnny on entering the lobby of the office building, ""So what goes on in this post-modern gas chamber?""There are also two young Scots, Archie (Ewen Bremner) and Maggie (Susan Vidler), whose accents are so thick that most of the vitriolic things they fling at each other remain unintelligible to Johnny. He knocks on the door of a woman he has seen undressing in a window. She invites him in, offers him vodka and is ready to have sex with him. At the last minute Johnny declines; he says she looks like his mother. Intercut with Johnny's journey through nighttown, with his seduction by Sophie and his half-hearted attempts to reconcile with Louise, is the story of a sadistic fellow alternately known as Jeremy and Sebastian, played by Greg Cruttwell, who looks like a young, pre-""Servant"" Dirk Bogarde. Eventually Johnny, Jeremy/ Sebastian, Louise, Sophie and Sandra all wind up in Sandra's flat in an extended sequence that slips effortlessly from melodrama to comedy to farce and something like psychic exhaustion. Perhaps ""Naked"" should not be analyzed too closely in any conventional way. It's as much about actors acting, finding their remarkable characters in their collaborations with Mr. Leigh, who is both the writer and director, as it is about the characters thus created and the landscape they inhabit. Mr. Thewlis is staggeringly fine, but everyone else in the cast is also special. The dialogue dazzles, whether it sounds like something overheard during a beery undergraduate discussion on the meaning of life, or takes off into its own mad stratosphere, as when Johnny considers the mystery of the silence of the human body: ""The most complex mechanism in the universe, but it still doesn't make any noise. What's going on in there?""

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""NAKED LUNCH,"" adapted by the dauntless David Cronenberg from William S. Burroughs's 1959 landmark novel, represents a remarkable meeting of the minds. It's hard to imagine another film maker who could delve so deeply into the monstrousness of Mr. Burroughs's vision, in the end coming up with a bona fide monster movie of his own. Yet while Mr. Cronenberg's ingenious approach to his material matches Mr. Burroughs's flair for the grotesque, it also shares the author's perfect nonchalance and his ice-cold wit. Seldom has a film maker offered his audience a more debonair invitation to go to hell. The director of ""The Fly,"" ""Dead Ringers"" and ""Scanners"" will not disappoint viewers who appreciate his devilish ingenuity. Instead of attempting the impossible task of adapting ""Naked Lunch"" literally, Mr. Cronenberg has treated this disjointed, hallucinatory book as a secondary source. Concentrating instead on Mr. Burroughs himself, the drug experience that colors his writing and the agonies of the creative process, Mr. Cronenberg also devises purely metaphorical versions of the author's wild and violent sexual scenarios. The result, by turns bracing, brilliant and vile, is a screen style as audacious as Mr. Burroughs's is on the page.""Naked Lunch"" makes an instantaneous break with conventional reality in its opening moments and never looks back. Centering on the adventures of Bill Lee, played by Peter Weller as a droll, deadpan evocation of the author (Lee was the maiden name of Mr. Burroughs's mother, and William Lee his pseudonym), the film begins with smallish bugs. Then it moves on to ever more huge, horrible and intelligent ones. Bill works in New York City as an exterminator and sees even that as a metaphor. ""Exterminate all rational thought: that is the conclusion I have come to,"" he says. In addition to viewing his job in philosophical terms, Bill has also used it as an excuse to ingest narcotic bug powder, to which both he and his wife, Joan (Judy Davis), have become addicted. Ms. Davis, who is wonderfully dry and unflappable in two different bizarre incarnations, at first turns up barely long enough to inject bug powder intravenously and conduct a lazy affair with one of Bill's friends. ""Hank and I, we're just bored,"" she tells Bill. ""It wasn't serious.""This is enough to raise Bill's suspicions that Joan is a secret agent for an enemy spy ring, especially after a large talking beetle befriends Bill and drops that hint. Joan must be eliminated, the beetle insists, speaking from an orifice that recalls Mr. Burroughs's taste for the playfully obscene and talking in the lively, Burroughs-like idiom of Mr. Cronenberg's inventive screenplay. ""It must be done this week,"" the insect says, ""and it must be done real tasty.""So Bill and Joan perform their ""William Tell act,"" just as Mr. Burroughs and his wife, Joan Vollmer Burroughs, did on one drunken evening in Mexico City in 1951. As Bill shoots and kills Joan, the film makes one of its many allusions to the real events of Mr. Burroughs's life. Soon afterward, he either physically or psychically flees New York for Interzone, a Tangier-like exotic setting in which the film's nightmarishness escalates to new levels (although ""Naked Lunch"" is so thoroughly hallucinatory that it's difficult to know exactly where its characters are, literally or figuratively). In Interzone, the suffering gets worse and the bugs get bigger as Bill attempts to write what will be ""Naked Lunch,"" the novel. On screen ""Naked Lunch"" recalls both ""The Sheltering Sky"" and ""Barton Fink"" in its respective evocations of the life of the literary exile and the torment of trying to write. Mr. Cronenberg's hideously clever contribution in the latter realm is the insect-cum-typewriter that supposedly assists Bill in his efforts but clearly has a mind of its own. Both the writing bug and the Mugwump, a man-sized and rather soigne strain of monster, are capable of registering their approval by oozing viscous, intoxicating substances from various parts of their anatomies. ""I'd like you to meet a friend of mine,"" Bill is told upon encountering his first cigarette-smoking Mugwump on a bar stool in Interzone. ""He specializes in sexual ambivalence.""These elements, plus a lot of attention to the addictive powers of the black meat of the giant Brazilian centipede, insure that Mr. Cronenberg's version of ""Naked Lunch"" is no more suitable to the fainthearted than Mr. Burroughs's was. And the film, while very different from the book, is every bit as impenetrable in its own way. By the time it reaches a repellent fever pitch, with one character literally tearing its body open to reveal someone of a different sex inside (a simple yet extravagantly weird evocation of the author's thoughts on sexual identity), ""Naked Lunch"" has become too stomach-turning and gone too far over the top to regain its initial aplomb. Yet for the most part this is a coolly riveting film and even a darkly entertaining one, at least for audiences with steel nerves, a predisposition toward Mr. Burroughs and a willingness to meet Mr. Cronenberg halfway. The gaunt, unsmiling Mr. Weller looks exactly right and brings a perfect offhandedness to his disarming dialogue. (""You're patronizing me, boys, but I don't mind 'cause you're so sweet to me too,"" he tells the film's Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg stand-ins.) And Ms. Davis is chillingly good as both Joan Lee and Joan Frost, a writer Bill meets with her husband in Interzone; between this and her work as the helpmate of the William Faulkner character in ""Barton Fink,"" Ms. Davis surely qualifies as the tortured writer's Muse of the Year. Also roaming through ""Naked Lunch"" are Roy Scheider as the demented Dr. Benway, an odd fixture of the pharmacological strain in Mr. Burroughs's writing; Ian Holm as a fellow writer with a grasp of the typewriter-bug's habits, and Julian Sands as a debauched Interzone playboy.""Stay until you finish the book, but then come back to us,"" Bill's friends say about his sojourn in Interzone. But if the terror so slyly and sickeningly rendered in ""Naked Lunch"" is representative, it's a miracle that artists ever survive the creative process to come home.""Naked Lunch"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes oblique sexual references and occasionally gruesome special effects. Naked Lunch Written and directed by David Cronenberg, based on the book by William S.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""Naked Tango,"" the first film to be directed as well as written by Leonard Schrader, attempts to illustrate and make dramatic the gaudy background of the dance that came out of the multi-ethnic Buenos Aires underworld in the 1920's. It's about the obsessive sadomasochistic love of Stephanie (Mathilda May), the pampered French wife of a much older Argentine judge (Fernando Rey), and Cholo (Vincent D'Onofrio), the handsome young gangster who makes her his dance slave. Cholo, a pimp by profession, has no interest in sex. He just likes to dance, dance, dance. For him the tango is better than sex, and so private that he blindfolds the three-man combo that plays for him. Sometimes he even blindfolds his female partner. Cholo and Stephanie had met when she became a prisoner in his bordello by a route too circuitous to mention. Something about Stephanie attracted Cholo. It could have been her Louise Brooks haircut, possibly the manacles she sometimes wore. In any case, the attraction was instant and kinky. Cholo and Stephanie dance and dance. Once, when they are tangoing, Stephanie is not wearing clothes, which helps to give the movie its title. Another time each holds a dagger under the other's chin. They while away another night tangoing in a bloody but otherwise empty abattoir. They don't make love until the night they witness a murder. Cholo is so turned on that he beds Stephanie in the front seat of a car. She is lying on broken glass and couldn't be more pleased. In this way the movie lurches on, with a humorlessness that the audience is not likely to share. It's difficult to keep a straight face when Cholo says to Stephanie with total sincerity: ""Don't worry. I'll never let anyone else kill you.""Stephanie has some zingers of her own. When she wakes up in the bordello, having been kidnapped and put in chains, the first question that pops into her pretty little head is, ""What time is it?""The actors remain solemn and grim throughout. The film isn't really preposterous, just unrealized. Mr. Schrader, who has written some very good screenplays (""Kiss of the Spider Woman""), doesn't seem to have any idea of how to make such crazy, heedless love comprehensible in film terms. He doesn't even present the tango in a way to suggest the primal passions contained within the music and the movement. There are lots of shots of feet, which may be designed for shoe festishists, but not enough of the lovers dancing in full figure. There are some stylish period sets, and a lot of stark lighting intended to recall the Expressionism of German films of the 1920's, though on color film stock. Nothing works, except Thomas Newman's musical score.""Naked Tango,"" which opens today at Cinema 2, is said to have been inspired by Manuel Puig, the Argentine novelist and author of ""Kiss of the Spider Woman."" It was produced in Buenos Aires, in English, with international financing and an international cast. It possesses no character whatsoever.""Naked Tango"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, partial nudity and simulated sex.

Review/Film; Lieutenant Drebin Whiffs the Smell of Fear (and Lobster) - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from June 28, 1991, Section C, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The summer is saved. Lieut. Frank Drebin is back and Leslie Nielsen is again playing him in David Zucker's delirious new comedy, ""The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear,"" solemnly described as ""more than a sequel.""In this follow-up to the 1988 hit ""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad"" the courtly, white-haired, perfectly manicured Drebin pits his cleverly concealed bewilderment against the wits of a group of greedy fuel barons determined to dictate White House energy policy. They don't know whom they're up against in Drebin, whose fondest wish is to be known as ""the environmental police detective."" Drebin dreams of a world in which he can eat a sea otter without getting sick.""The Naked Gun 2 1/2"" may not be quite as consistently funny as ""Airplane!"" or even ""Ruthless People,"" which Mr. Zucker directed with his brother Jerry and Jim Abrahams, but it seems to be, after the fact. For that matter, even before the fact. The trailer for the film has been convulsing audiences since it first appeared in theaters here a couple of months ago. The enthusiastic Zucker, Zucker & Abrahams style of movie parody is too rarely seen to prompt much head-shaking about gags that don't work. The entire film is justified by those gags that do succeed, beginning with a pre-credit sequence that is possibly one of the most blithely hilarious six or seven minutes of film stock ever exposed to light. The setting: the White House. The occasion: a formal dinner party given by George and Barbara Bush with, among those in attendance, Nelson and Winnie Mandela, John Sununu and Drebin, who is being honored for having shot his 1,000th drug pusher. Drebin isn't as impressed by the occasion as he is by his broiled lobster. He's hungry. As he cracks claws and removes meat from each cranny of the sea beast, Mrs. Bush, sitting on his right, keeps being so impolitely whacked by Drebin's elbow and arm that she spends much of the meal on the floor, flat on her back, her legs in the air. Mrs. Bush, played by an amazing look alike named Margery Ross, remains smiling and gallant through each new indignity. Her husband remains thumbs up and oblivious. If ""The Naked Gun 2 1/2"" never again attains that level of inspired rudeness, it comes close many times as Drebin wanders around Washington in Mr. Nielsen's version of what might be called an informed haze. Life isn't easy at the top of one's profession. In addition to getting to the bottom of a plot that would sabotage all anti-pollution measures, Drebin is trying to win back Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley), who left him at the end of the first film when he was caught in a compromising position with the Queen of England. Their new courtship has both highs and lows and survives a bombing that destroys the offices of Jane's new boss, Dr. Meinheimer (Richard Griffith), the man responsible for a sane new energy policy. Drebin romances Jane on the dance floor and in the bedroom. Both sequences have a great deal of fun at the expense of treasured movie cliches.""The Naked Gun 2 1/2,"" identified in the opening credits as ""un film de David Zucker,"" is best when it is casual about its narrative responsibilities. It's a marvelous grab-bag of variations on old routines, including one in which a wheelchair runs amok, and sight gags. (A nightclub called the Blue Note is decorated with large news photographs of disasters.) When Drebin and Jane ask Sam, the pianist, to play their song, it is ""Ding Dong the Witch Is Dead.""Mr. Zucker and Pat Proft, who collaborated on the screenplay, have perfect pitch when it comes to cornball dialogue. Much of this is given to the sincerely obtuse Drebin, who likes to say such things as, ""Well, the cows have come home to roost.""""The Naked Gun 2 1/2"" is the sort of film in which gags are often funny in direct relation to their obviousness, as when a policeman is asked by a young woman, who is just barely dressed, ""Is this a bust?""Undergraduate and old-time two-a-day burlesque comedy is skillfully integrated with sketches of contemporary sensibility. Look for the public service television spot promoting nuclear power that features a sweet, cuddly Old English sheepdog with two tails. The big chase scenes are not as successful or as funny as the rest of the film. The timing is off. Mr. Zucker and his associates are most at ease when they are scoring comic points and quickly moving on to something entirely other. Mr. Nielsen is again splendid: a little bit pompous, immaculately groomed, but always as vulnerable as a man who is unaware that he is walking around without any trousers. Miss Presley is a winsome Juliet to his clumsy Romeo, a willing Ginger to his ardent Fred, a worldly Jane to his Tarzan. As a dedicated environmentalist, she really cares about ""the end zone layer.""This time around, neither George Kennedy nor O. J. Simpson has much to do, but they do that with spirit. Robert Goulet appears as a villain, and Zsa Zsa Gabor turns up as herself, having an encounter with yet another policeman. As the First Lady, Miss Ross is so graciously stalwart that even Mrs. Bush should laugh. Mr. Zucker apparently doesn't know when to stop. The film's printed credits, furnished to reviewers, are full of gems. Sandwiched between the Stock Librarian (Suzy Lafer) and the Choreographer (Mianda Garrison) is the Stock Answer (""I'll have it ready in the morning"").""The Naked Gun 2 1/2,"" which is rated PG-13 (""Parents strongly cautioned""), includes some vulgar dialogue and partial nudity.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Ron Peck's ""Strip Jack Naked"" is an anomaly: an autobiographical film whose subject is visually absent except for an occasional fuzzy snapshot or group photo from a yearbook. Mr. Peck's physical remove from a project that includes many shots of other men, some of them naked, backhandedly underscores the themes of his film, which is a chronological narrative of growing up gay in England between 1962, when he was 14 years old, and 1990. Until 1967, when homosexuality was decriminalized in England, being gay necessitated being invisible to the rest of society. Mr. Peck's physical absence pointedly suggests that his awakening to gay sexuality, culture and politics be taken as representing a collective experience shared by his generation.""Strip Jack Naked,"" which was presented yesterday at the Biograph Cinema as part of the third annual New York International Festival of Lesbian and Gay Film and opens a weeklong run at the Public Theater today, is also a companion piece to Mr. Peck's 1978 film ""Nighthawks."" An exploration of gay life in London in the mid-1970's, the grainy, crudely made ""Nighthawks"" focused on a young teacher's nocturnal search for companionship, with much of the action centered in one dimly lighted bar.""Nighthawks,"" as Mr. Peck points out, was already something of a period piece by the time it was released in 1978, four years after it was begun. By that time, the world it depicted of discreet bar cruising had already been superseded by flashier, more public gay discos.""Strip Jack Naked,"" which is told clearly and methodically, begins with Mr. Peck's first adolescent crush and traces his slow, secretive, searching out of information about homosexuality in a repressive climate. He discovers important clues in an American magazine, Film and Filming, that seems to have influenced him to become a film maker. He eventually discovers a salvation of sorts in a bar that becomes the model for the club in ""Nighthawks.""""Nighthawks,"" which the British Film Institute refused to subsidize, was financed with money that Mr. Peck raised himself by advertising in gay newspapers. Much of the casting was also done through advertising in the gay press. The experience of making it, Mr. Peck recalls, represented his final coming-out. But when the film was completed, he had nearly four hours of footage. Some of what had to be cut from ""Nighthawks"" is included in ""Strip Jack Naked.""Visually, ""Strip Jack Naked"" is a shadowy, impressionistic work that blends film clips, memorabilia and photographs (Dirk Bogarde's haunted face in ""Victim,"" a film about homosexuality and blackmail, is one of the most memorable) into a moody chronicle that changes in tone from personal memoir into a generalized history of the gay movement. The film has its polemical moments. For Mr. Peck, Britain's war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982 symbolized a chilling of Britain's social climate, as an ethic of ""make love not war"" gave way to the reverse. If ""Strip Jack Naked"" is a film about self-affirmation, it is also permeated with the sadness of the AIDS epidemic. An early sequence remembers a colleague who appeared in ""Nighthawks"" and who died in 1989. But even amid the catastrophe of AIDS, Mr. Peck finds solace in the gay movement's visibility and solidarity.

The proudly sophomoric comedy style of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker writing team, responsible for ''Airplane!,'' ''Top Secret!'' and now (with Pat Proft) ''The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,'' is funniest when it's hardest to second-guess. But this time, in a scattershot detective parody that's a spinoff of the team's television series, things are relatively sane. It will help if, while watching ''The Naked Gun'' at Embassy 1 or other neighborhood theaters, viewers can assume a mental age of about 14. The jokes will seem fresher that way, and they will also, much to the writers' credit, seem screamingly funny at times. Bathroom jokes, giddy repetition and calamitous pratfalls are the sine qua non of this kind of humor, but ''The Naked Gun'' gives such things an unexpected sophistication. Much of this can be attributed to the dapper presence of Leslie Nielsen who, as Lieut. Frank Drebin, manages to bring something heroic to the role of a perfectly oblivious fall guy. First seen at a meeting of hostile world leaders in Beirut, Lebanon (''And don't ever let me catch you guys in America!'' he shouts to look-alikes representing Idi Amin, Yasir Arafat, Muammar el-Qaddafi and others), Drebin returns to Los Angeles and finds himself on the hunt for a diabolical businessman named Victor Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban). Drebin, who is more or less outsmarted by Ludwig's tank of expensive fighting fish, isn't much of a match for the man himself. Nor can he keep up with Drebin's beautiful assistant, Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley), who has a gift for the double entendre and an unfortunate habit of walking into things. ''The Naked Gun'' is so good-natured that it brings out the funny side of performers who, like Miss Presley, have never seemed to have much sense of humor in the past. Also in the cast, and equally well used, are George Kennedy as Drebin's friend and superior, Nancy Marchand as the Mayor of Los Angeles and Charlotte Zucker, who is David and Jerry Zucker's mother. David Zucker, who directed ''The Naked Gun,'' has given it a cheerful, messy style that never quite matches the ebullience of the writing. But high spirits may be all that a film like this really needs. One of the more inspired visual gags is the standard young-and-in-love montage that finds Mr. Nielsen and Miss Presley frolicking prettily together and experiencing quite a few physical mishaps themselves. This sequence ends with a small credit in its lower left-hand corner, making it suitable for use on MTV. Later on, once he and Miss Presley have begun their photogenic romance, she tells him, ''I'm a very lucky woman.'' ''So am I,'' Mr. Nielsen earnestly replies. It's impossible not to see that coming, but it's equally impossible not to laugh.''The Naked Gun'' is rated PG-13 (''Special Parental Guidance for Those Younger Than 13''). It contains a number of innocently off-color jokes.

Review/Film; Japanese Psychotic Gets His Wish: Return to Jail - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from March 15, 1988, Section C, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The New Directors/New Films festival is presenting a number of unconventional documentaries, but none as alarming and significantly lunatic as ''The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On,'' conceived by Shohei Imamura (''Vengeance Is Mine'') and directed by Kazuo Hara as his first feature. Its central figure is Kenzo Okuzaki, 65 years old, a World War II veteran who lives in Kobe with his pliant, uncomplaining wife, whom we later learn is dying of cancer. At the start of the film, Kenzo has already spent 13 years 9 months in jail. His crimes: plotting to assassinate a former Prime Minister, attempting to hit the Emperor with lead pellets fired with a sling shot and distributing pornographic pictures of the Emperor to people outside a Tokyo department store. Kenzo is a political activist. He's also a marriage broker. In an astonishing and funny precredit sequence, we see him delivering a wedding feast homily in which he recalls his years in jail and suggests that all countries and, indeed, all families are barriers to the true brotherhood of man. The bride and groom listen with eyes lowered, as if this were the sort of thing every bride and groom expected to hear on their wedding day.''The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On'' will be shown at the Museum of Modern Art at 8:30 tonight and 6 P. M. tomorrow. From everything the audience sees, Kenzo Okuzaki is a certifiable psychotic, though ''The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On'' never addresses this suspicion. He's the sort of fellow who writes long, crazily incoherent letters to editors, confronts people on street corners and harangues them with a loudspeaker from his van. It could be that Mr. Hara thinks the psychotic state is the only sane response to the contradictions in contemporary Japanese society. Whatever the film director thinks, he never says. Instead he follows Kenzo around Japan as the former soldier tries to get at the truth of something that happened more than 40 years ago - the execution of three of his army comrades when they were serving in New Guinea at the end of the war. The audience never understands just why, at this late date, Kenzo decides to investigate these events, the details of which remain fuzzy. With Mr. Hara and a camera crew in tow, Kenzo calls on former officers and enlisted men he thinks were responsible for ordering the executions. There are suggestions that the men were condemned for desertion or for cannibalism. There's the further suggestion that they were executed to provide meat for their starving comrades. Some of those interviewed treat Kenzo with respect and attempt to answer his questions. Others equivocate. Some contradict themselves. Through all the testimony, Kenzo behaves as if he had been appointed by God to act as His prosecuting attorney. At one point he starts beating an old man who is sick, while the old man's wife pleads: ''No violence. No violence.'' The farce becomes dark and disorienting. The cops are frequently called, and Kenzo often has to admit that there are some circumstances in which violence is called for. He says it with the stoicism of the true fanatic. At one point he decides he'd like to have his own jail cell in his house and drives off to the Kobe prison to get the measurements. When he's not allowed in, he goes into a tirade about the guards being ''law's slaves, just like the Emperor.''It's difficult to understand ''The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On'' without knowing more of the facts than the film wants to give. It may be that there really are no more facts. What we see is all there is. In that case, the film raises pertinent questions about the extent to which the presence of the camera ''entraps'' events that otherwise would never have occurred. In some documentaries, like this one, the questions are especially pertinent. The most invigorating thing about ''The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On'' is its consistent irreverence. It doesn't mean to be polite or nice or soothing. It means to provoke and disturb - and let the devil take the hindmost. A screen note at the end ot the film reports that after photography was completed, Kenzo set out to assassinate one of his former Army comrades and, unable to get at him, shot and wounded the man's son instead. He is now serving a 12-year prison sentence, seeming to be very happy, as well as satisfied that his wife died earlier than expected. Otherwise he would have had to worry about how to take care of her.

"'CRUEL STORY OF YOUTH,' BY NAGISA OSHIMA - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from July 18, 1984, Section C, Page 20Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.''Cruel Story of Youth,'' which opens today at the Film Forum and is Nagisa Oshima's second film, was produced in 1960, but the theater's new color-and-CinemaScope print is so resplendent that the movie could have been made last year. There are few color prints being shown in our first-run theaters that are as rich as this one. This is more than an idle comment on the excellent quality of the projection at the Film Forum. Mr. Oshima, one of Japan's longest-running controversial directors (''Death by Hanging,'' ''The Ceremony,'' ''In the Realm of the Senses,'' ''Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence''), makes movies that frequently look as if they'd been lit by lightning. Though the images are often bleak and the landscapes sunless, the colors have the peculiar, unnatural brightness of things seen in a flash in a thunderstorm. The movies themselves have a kind of condensed narrative style that also suggests their own very particular reality. Having admitted these virtues, I must also admit that I still find it difficult to respond to his movies with the enthusiasm and excitement of many colleagues. The problem is partially due to contemporary political and social references that remain forever unexplained to the outsider.''Cruel Story of Youth,'' which was Mr. Oshima's first major box-office hit in Japan, is the seemingly dispassionate tale of the decline and fall of a pair of middle-class Tokyo teen- agers. They are Makoto, a pretty girl who looks as if she had been brought up reading nothing but Seventeen, and Kiyoshi, a good-looking young student who first seduces Makoto and then talks her into a racket by which they extort money from older men picked up by Makoto. Though the print is spankingly fresh, there is something dated and neo-Godardian about Mr. Oshima's pretended lack of passion. Clearly he is an articulate social critic. The aimless deliquency of Makoto and Kiyoshi is intended to be a scathing indictment of an entire society. Yet the distance at which he chooses to tell this story has the effect of making it seem less chilly and shocking than merely dim. And when he contrasts the self-indulgences of Makoto and Kiyoshi with the disillusion of slightly older, former student activists, I'm completely confused, perhaps because I still associate student activism with the late 1960's, which, of course, were still years off at the time this film was made. Whether or not you respond to the film's story, the visual style is always interesting, even when not terribly revealing. There's not a predictable shot in the entire movie, which is full of oddly off-center close-ups, panoramic shots of dead landscapes and occasional sequences shot with a hand-held camera, which appears to have the short attention span of its two unhappy lovers.

"'Naked Childhood,' a First Film - The New York Times","and for all the other characters, especially the old. All the members of the cast are nonprofessionals. Marie Marc, who plays the ancient mother of an already old couple of foster parents (René and Marie-Louise Thierry), is alone worth seeing—as she sings a folksong off-key, or speaks of her past, or just conveys a sense of wisdom and love of life that weakens across the generation gap. Another character in the movie sings a splendid song—a bride, at her own wedding reception, who clearly thinks she is in good voice. And there is a fine performance by Henri Puff, who plays Tarrazon's foster brother—awkward, ungrown and diffident. When a death—the separation for which all the partings of childhood are a metaphor—brings on a crisis that begins to resolve the boy's delinquency, one becomes aware that Pialat is doing something that movies rarely do any more: tell a simple, touching story warmly, straight. The film, which is in color and which is Pialat's first movie of feature length, was shown yesterday at the New York Film Festival.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""THE NAKED PREY"" is a poor and tasteless motion-picture entertainment, redeemed somewhat by its authentic African setting and its effective use of tribal drums and native music as the accompaniment for a primitive jungle chase. A fundamental weakness stems from the fact that its protagonist is barely introduced to the audience. We know him only as the leader of a safari, a kind soul who wants to give trinkets to some tribesmen, but is prevented from doing so by a tight-fisted archvillain, interested only in killing elephants, whether for their ivory or just for the fun of killing. As it happens, those tribesmen who did not get their trinkets like to kill for sport, too. They set upon the safari one hot African day. The tribesmen skewer some of their party on their spears, lop off the heads of others with their swords. One fellow is plastered with mud and then barbecued over hot coals. Another is trussed up and set before a golden cobra, which, promptly and predictably bites him in the face. It is disgusting stuff and the wise viewer will get out of the New Embassy Theater even before the chase has begun. But now it does begin. The leader of the safari, Cornel Wilde (the star, producer and director of this film), is stripped of his clothes and shoes and is given a short head start. Then the lion-hunters of the tribe, bearing spears, take after him. It is a lung-bursting exercise and Mr. Wilde, a swordsman who once was of Olympic caliber, manages to impale a couple of his antagonists on a spear of his own. We also see him hack up a snake and eat its raw meat for sustenance. But he appears to prefer the meat of a giant jungle snail, carved out with his knife. Interspersed with this coarse action are shots of lions eating antelope, frogs eating other frogs, vultures eating anything that is dead. It is called symbolism. Put a man in the jungle and he becomes a beast. Or, put it another way, it is not the beast that makes the jungle, but rather the jungle that makes the beast.

"Review: ‘No Escape,’ Starring Owen Wilson as a Man in the Cross Hairs - The New York Times","In 2001, already developing a comic acting career, Owen Wilson tried to stretch. In “Behind Enemy Lines,” he played a naval aviator shot down and pursued by bloodthirsty Serbian paramilitary units. Not quite an action hero, he conveyed the intense fear and desperation of a fugitive in the cross hairs. Now Mr. Wilson returns for run-for-your-life seconds. In “No Escape,” he is again in hostile territory, as Jack Dwyer, an engineer who has joined a multinational corporation after his own company failed, and is moving his family to an unnamed Southeast Asian country. As brave a front as he and his wife, Annie (Lake Bell), put up for their two young daughters, they know the situation is bad. Of course, it’s about to get much worse. As “No Escape” begins, the Dwyers are landing, befriended on their flight by Hammond (Pierce Brosnan), a seatmate with the rough beard, fresh scars and randy cheer of an old post-colonial hand. When Jack takes a walk out of their luxury hotel the next morning, he’s caught in a clash between the police and mobs, then scrambles back minutes before anti-Western revolutionaries go room to room, slaughtering foreigners. From that point, the film is a series of fight-or-flight set pieces of the panicked family trying to stay alive. Directed breathlessly by John Erick Dowdle (“As Above/So Below”), the movie is filled with jittery shots from hand-held cameras, and hurtles along at a pace that is especially helpful in racing past the holes in the paper-thin plot. Hammond shows up fortuitously to provide small-arms fire, temporary haven and a plan to get out. For Mr. Wilson, this is probably just a detour from his usual comedic roles. Mr. Brosnan, though, continues to shed the smooth and silky customs of his James Bond days. Among the most terrifying scenes is an early shot of Mr. Brosnan in the hotel bar, shouting lyrics to a Huey Lewis tune. Oh, the horror. “No Escape” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for much blood, gore and menace. And that karaoke number.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/movies/review-no-escape-starring-owen-wilson-as-a-man-in-the-cross-hairs.html

You think it's easy to make a no-brain action movie? ""No Escape"" demonstrates how hard it really is. Ray Liotta plays a prisoner in the year 2022, shipped to a privately owned maximum-security prison in Australia. The high-tech prison actually looks like a bunch of cheap metal canisters on pilings, and he doesn't stay there long. He is dropped on a jungle island, where he's caught between two no-tech groups of prisoners: the ruthless Outsiders, and the peaceful Insiders. He tries to . . . escape!On paper, this might have seemed like a foolproof mix of elements borrowed from other, proven action movies. Take a bit of ""Mad Max,"" add a dash of ""Demolition Man,"" mix with a soupcon of ""Escape From New York."" The plan backfires. ""No Escape"" is long and lethargic. The action looks fake, and the special effects are cheesy. Mr. Liotta is always interesting to watch, and he is the only character worth saving. The Insiders include a robed father figure called Father (Lance Henriksen) and a baby-faced kidnapper (Kevin Dillon), both of whom are so annoying they belong on a lonely island. The Outsiders are led by Marek (Stuart Wilson), who has a very bad dreadlock hair weave. He seems to be a cross between Richard Dawson as the game-show host in the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie ""The Running Man"" and Tina Turner in ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome."" He sounds like a flat-toned guy from the Midwest. The director, Martin Campbell, has made a couple of underrated thrillers, including ""Criminal Law"" and ""Defenseless.""

NOT in years has there been so much spying, peeping and pussyfooting down the hall as in ""No Escape"" (Le Piège), a second-rate drama from France that opened yesterday at the World Theatre. As it opens, a lecherous old boardinghouse owner spies on his widowed daughter-in-law. The gaping increases when the girl has a rendezvous with a strapping boarder and murder fugitive. Grimly checking on all three, apparently out of pure meanness, is a chambermaid who smacks her lips over the bleak finale. The whole thing, needless to say, hinges on sex. At least the French have made no bones about the baldness of the set-up. The scenario is credited to Charles Brabant, who also directed; J. Marcerou and A. Tabet. Most of the action takes place in the sleazy little boardinghouse, with Charles Vanel, Magali Noel, Raf Vallone and Betty Schneider creeping about the premises. In the background, oil field pumps drone away. The photography is lean and suspenseful and the dialogue (with some skittish translations), is held to the minimum. Most of this Ellis Films release unfolds in pantomime. Maybe it is just as well, considering some of the subtitles. At one point, somebody phones the police station. The English reads: ""Pass me the Chief Inspector."" With or without gravy?This drama is also about a good third too long. Even so, the four principals do pretty well when extended close-ups put them on the spot. As the dangerous old roué, M. Vanel comes off best. Mlle. Noel, who resembles Sophia Loren, is appropriately torrid, and M. Vallone is broodingly virile. As the servant, Mlle. Schneider sports a dead-pan countenance throughout. This is probably the right attitude for the kind of film that has steamed into port many times before and is sure to return. The CastNO ESCAPE, scenario by J. Marcerou, Charles Brabaut and A.

They never speak, but they are, at first, alone, camping in a space partly overtaken by nature. They doze together, scavenge the grounds and urinate outdoors. One recurring thread in “All the Cities of the North” concerns how people use and recycle buildings, appropriating spaces in ways for which they were not intended. The flurries of narration allude to socialistic objectives in architecture, whether in a Yugoslav company’s construction work for the International Trade Fair in Lagos, Nigeria, or the plans for the 20th-century city of Brasília.

Review: ‘Northern Soul’ Shows ’70s England Through a Music Lens - The New York Times,"with a side order of aggro and amphetamines — John is soon a willing member of the cult of rare recordings. Funny and feisty, gritty and sometimes grim, this first feature from the photographer Elaine Constantine delivers a sweaty snapshot of a very specific time and place. Surrounded by industrial drabness, the dance halls of Lancashire pulse with light and movement. Squeaky-clean pop is fading, and disco is waiting in the wings, but for these kids, it’s Edwin Starr and Frankie Valli who offer escape from sausage factory futures and nagging parents. Performed with loose energy and studded with beautifully observant moments — like the worn spot on the hideous bedroom carpet where John practices his spins — “Northern Soul” suffers most from a lack of dramatic focus and a tendency to elbow women out of the frame. There’s tragedy, and there is disillusion, but Ms. Constantine’s writing is no match for her empathy and ability to conjure atmosphere. That said, the songs are smashing and the stomping joy infectious, smoothly summoning the way music can inject hope into the bleakest of lives. “Northern Soul” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

The real drama comes not from Dusty’s con but from Mona’s reaction to the situation. In this, “Home Sweet Hell” deserves a shred of credit for its escalating nastiness. But as a marital satire, this cartoonish movie is a blunt instrument, lacking the elegance and ambiguity of perspective seen just recently in “Gone Girl.” While the oafish men come off poorly, the treatment of women as nothing more than schemers and monstrous Martha Stewart clones seems woefully past its expiration date. “Home Sweet Hell” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

"‘Northern Borders,’ With Bruce Dern and Geneviève Bujold - The New York Times","A group of young people learned something about the movie business during the making of “Northern Borders.” One thing they presumably learned is that good intentions don’t guarantee a good movie. The film, a sluggish adaptation of a novel by Howard Frank Mosher, gives us Bruce Dern and Geneviève Bujold as a long-married couple who barely speak to each other, with Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as the young grandchild who comes to live with them in Vermont. It’s 1956 and Jay Craven, who directed and wrote the script, is going for coming-of-age wistfulness, but you don’t get that simply by making every scene feel as if it takes place in some kind of cosmic slow motion. Mr. Dern is fine in his crotchety-old-man mode, but the rest of the acting is labored, and the story is an unfocused mishmash that includes a not-very-scandalous family secret, the coming of electrification, an old bank robbery and more. The most interesting thing about the movie is its origin story. Mr. Craven, a professor at Marlboro College in Vermont, turned the low-budget film into a sort of class project: The professional crew was augmented by more than 30 students from 11 colleges, earning academic credit. It may not be a recipe for great filmmaking, perhaps, but almost certainly a premium learning experience.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/16/movies/northern-borders-with-bruce-dern-and-genevieve-bujold.html
"In ‘Northern Light,’ Michiganders Brave Weather and Poverty - The New York Times","a grueling, 500-mile slog on sheer ice — commandeers only a fraction of screen time. Its anticipation, however, is a unifying thread, an aspirational undercurrent to the families’ quotidian struggles. Money is tight, and jobs are precarious; and as the movie slowly accumulates worries over house payments and health care, the $10,000 prize becomes a life-changing brass ring. Parking his camera in church and truck stops, at family dinners and the gym, Mr. Bentgen is an impassive onlooker who offers no voice-over and only a minimum of on-screen information. Shooting wide and high, he assembles a collage of contrasts: chilly exteriors and warm, bustling interiors; financial fragility and money-no-object generosity; physical degeneration and emotional sturdiness. Seemingly oblivious to scrutiny, his subjects interact with an easy naturalism as commonplace events (the birth of a baby; the death of a deer) unfold in movie-long arcs. Yet there’s a stillness to the filmmaking, coupled with Saunder Jurriaans and Danny Bensi’s truly lovely original score, that lends specific shots — toddlers bundled up like pastel Ewoks on a snowdrift, or a bakery window glowing like a still life in a gallery — a near-heartbreaking melancholy. “Northern Light” contains more than one competition, but what it’s really about is the difference between trying to win and trying not to lose.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/movies/in-northern-light-michiganders-brave-weather-and-poverty.html

FILM REVIEW; Angels Dare to Tread A Spooky Countryside - The New York Times,"The annals of science record several cases of twins who communicate, as children, by means of special languages incomprehensible to anyone but them. I have no idea if Mark and Michael Polish -- twin brothers whose third film, ''Northfork,'' opens today in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles -- are literal examples of this phenomenon, but their movies, which they write together and which Michael Polish directs, seem to draw on a private lexicon of images and metaphors. While their work -- ''Twin Falls Idaho,'' ''Jackpot'' and now ''Northfork'' -- does show signs of various literary, visual and folkloric influences, the dreamy, elliptical way they weave together allusions and associations has an entrancing if somewhat opaque integrity. Their originality is unforced, and the logic of their stories is as sincere as it is strange.''Northfork'' takes place in Montana in the 1950's as a squad of government officials, in trim charcoal suits and bulky black Fords, tries to evacuate the few remaining residents of a town scheduled for inundation by a new hydroelectric dam. The structure, with its hulking concrete edifice and enormous green turbines, has a spooky sublimity. Some of the townspeople refer to it as Northfork's tombstone, and it casts a funereal shadow over the place it will both memorialize and destroy, adding to the movie's somber, edge-of-the-grave atmosphere. The wide, austere countryside, beautifully shot in washed-out CinemaScope (by M. David Mullen, who also worked with the Polishes on their previous features), is as still and silent as an old photograph, and the score (by Stuart Matthewman, another Polish brothers regular) is like an eerie electronic echo of Aaron Copland. Among the people left in Northfork are a religious zealot with two wives and a homemade ark, a shaggy minister (Nick Nolte) and a young boy named Irwin (Duel Farnes) who has just been returned to the town orphanage because of his chronic illness. In his dreams (at least, I think they are his dreams), Irwin encounters four visiting angels (at least, I think they're meant to be angels) dressed in late-Victorian medicine-show costumes. Among them are a silent cowboy (Ben Foster), a learned chatterbox with wooden hands and complicated eyeglasses (Anthony Edwards) and a regal hermaphrodite named Flower Hercules (Daryl Hannah). Provoked by their leader, Cup of Tea (Robin Sachs), they bicker about what to do with the boy, who says he is an angel himself, offering the scars on his back -- remnants of his amputated wings -- as proof. Meanwhile, the dark-suited government men (among them James Woods, Peter Coyote and Mark Polish) offer immaculate white wings as an incentive to leave and a means of escape. Whether you are captivated by all this or merely baffled depends on how susceptible you are to the lyrical, wonder-cabinet mysticism of the movie's approach to the American past. Like another pair of filmmaking brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen, Mark and Michael Polish have a taste for odd, half-buried Americana. But their quiet, almost morose sensibility is miles away from the Coens' antic whimsy. At times their slow, deadpan style may remind you of David Lynch, but without the unnerving pyschological subtext, the undercurrents of dread, sex and mayhem, that lurk below the surface of Mr. Lynch's pictures. The filmmaker they are closest to may be Wim Wenders: the brothers share both his sentimental interest in mythic American landscapes and his sentimental interest in angels. At once credulous and coy, ''Northfork'' refuses to mark the boundary between dream and reality, conjuring a seamless world in which every mundane detail carries an aura of hushed enchantment. The actors, especially Mr. Woods and Mr. Nolte, convey a haggard sorrow, but the movie is emotionally hermetic, leaving us no way into the emotions of the characters. The actors are ultimately part of the scenery, and what you remember are the haunting, carefully composed images, presented in a teasing, discontinuous sequence. There is nothing quite like this movie, and I'm not altogether sure there is much more to it than its lovely peculiarity. But at a moment when so many films strive to be obvious and interchangeable as possible, it is gratifying to find one that is puzzling, subtle and handmade.''Northfork'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its childlike view of things is shadowed in appropriate places by the fact of death and the possibility of violence.

David Mullen; edited by Leo Trombetta; music by Stuart Matthewman; production designers, Ichelle Spitzig and Del Polish; released by Paramount Classics.

FILM REVIEW; All the Sensibility That Money Can Buy - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from April 27, 2001, Section E, Page 10Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Henry James's 1904 novel ''The Golden Bowl,'' the work he considered his masterpiece, is permeated with uneasy presentiments about the rough-and-tumble high-speed world ushered in by the Industrial Revolution. It was not without a certain dread that this American-born Anglophile foresaw that the next 100 years would be the American century. The novel's prime mover, Adam Verver, is a rapacious American art collector and the world's first billionaire. In the meticulous, stately Merchant-Ivory screen adaptation of ''The Golden Bowl,'' Adam (Nick Nolte) observes with both admiration and contempt that Americans want streetcars, not art museums. A wealthy collector pillaging Europe for treasure to bring back home, Adam made his fortune in bituminous coal and has gone about acquiring ''class'' with a proprietary vengeance. Eventually he plans to return with his booty to his hometown, the mythically named American City, where he hopes to improve the cultural climate by forcing European art down people's throats. In translating the novel into a film, the producer Ismail Merchant, his directing partner, James Ivory, and their favorite screenwriter, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, have made a movie that's an ambitious, profoundly ambiguous statement about their own passion for the cultivated, high-culture sensibility epitomized by James and E. M. Forster, as opposed to the cruder mass culture that has eclipsed these literary heroes. Resisting the impulse to make ''The Golden Bowl'' a romantic period elegy, they have shoveled extra coal into the engine of this impressive but emotionally distanced movie by inserting period film clips that emphasize the rude, clanging rush of modern history. These sped-up silent clips illustrate the jarring contrasts between the privileged, psychologically veiled world inhabited by its four principal characters and the machine-driven immigrant American culture that would soon produce jazz and later rock 'n' roll and rap. They also tilt the movie gently but decisively away from its hothouse psychological climate of secrets and lies charging a rarefied cultural world, making the story a chillier, more contemporary social allegory of how money can buy people as well as art. The story of ''The Golden Bowl'' is a carefully balanced open-ended equation that is not resolved until the end, when Adam brings his ultimate trophy, the beautiful and brilliant but penniless American socialite Charlotte Stant (Uma Thurman), back to the United States from Europe against her will. This relocation separates Charlotte once and for all from the love of her life, Prince Amerigo (Jeremy Northam), the suave, handsome but impoverished Italian aristocrat with whom she has been carrying on a passionate secret affair while he has been married to Adam's less beautiful, less clever daughter, Maggie (Kate Beckinsale). Maggie has been Charlotte's closest friend from childhood, and both women shamelessly dote on the dashing prince. In James's novel, every nuance of the relationships among the foursome, who establish an illusory perfect harmony, is explored in exhaustive and exquisite detail. That illusion persists until the hidden truth comes out, but even then it is acknowledged only euphemistically, as the four, with their desperate conflicting drives, struggle to maintain an impossible equanimity. Works of art, among them the metaphorical golden bowl (a perfect fusion of gold and crystal flawed by a barely discernible crack), assume immense psychological weight. Much of the dialogue in Ms. Jhabvala's carefully wrought screenplay voices feelings that remain unspoken in the novel, and this is the movie's biggest problem. No matter how well the characters' thoughts have been translated into speech, the act of compressing their rich, complex inner lives into dialogue without resorting to voice-over narration inevitably tends to cheapen them and turn a drama about the revelation of hidden truths into the terser, more commonplace language of an intelligent soap opera.''The Golden Bowl'' is also James's ultimate variation on a theme that ran through much of his work: the often hard lessons learned by innocent Americans abroad and the notion of their puritanical virtue betrayed by European sophistication and cynicism. Here James turns things around and lets the rich Americans, who in earlier novels might have been taken in by the conniving Europeans, be the victors. Even so, ''The Golden Bowl's'' vision of brawling American enterprise seems limited by James's own knowledge. Adam Verver has always seemed a bit too refined for an American robber baron who made a killing in mining. Suggestions that there might be some coal dust figuratively buried under his fingernails are undercut by his image as a stuffy if robust aesthete. Mr. Nolte's carefully calibrated performance improves as it goes along and Adam's suspicion of Charlotte's betrayal freezes his expression into a penetrating eagle-eyed glare. Ms. Thurman's Charlotte is only partly convincing. When expressing her character's reckless passion, she lets go with a flailing emotional abandon. But Charlotte's refinement eludes Ms. Thurman. She moves gawkily, and even her outbursts have the ring of a teenager's impulsive tantrums. The most satisfying of the four lead performances belong to the British cast members, Ms. Beckinsale and Mr. Northam, who are better than their American counterparts at layers of emotional concealment. As Ms. Beckinsale's Maggie metamorphoses from a victim into a steely survivor who takes control of her circumstances and makes the necessary sacrifices, each beat registers precisely. As the movie's resident dreamboat who marries for money knowing full well what he will have to sacrifice, Mr. Northam exudes an unassuming command (he adopts a graceful Italian accent) that lends the notes of resignation and make-the-best-of-it realism an edge of sadness. It's easy to understand why both Maggie and Charlotte feel they can't live without this charmer. Anjelica Huston gives the role of Fanny Assingham, the meddlesome matchmaker whose discreet machinations backfire, a bracingly spiky mixture of moralism and half-stifled prurience. Filmed in several of the grand estates and palaces around Europe, ''The Golden Bowl'' is probably the most lavish Merchant-Ivory film. Yet nowhere do you get a sense that it is substituting décor for substance. Still, the film, which opens today at the Paris Theater, arrives at an uncomfortable moment in the Merchant-Ivory collaboration. Coolly received last year at the Cannes Film Festival, the film was dropped by Miramax (and taken over by Lion's Gate) after the creators refused to submit to cuts; and yes, it is leisurely. But ''The Golden Bowl,'' with its gradual accumulation of psychological stress, needs all that room to breathe. Because it had even more time, a six-part 1972 British mini-series of the novel did a better job of creating texture and building emotional suspense. As for the Merchant-Ivory brand name, which became synonymous with cinematic tastefulness in the early 90's, it has suffered unfairly from a backlash by critics who have seen that very tastefulness as emblematic of a pernicious yuppie snobbery. Because it lacks the emotional sparks that have ignited recent screen adaptations of James's ''Wings of the Dove'' and Edith Wharton's ''Age of Innocence,'' ''The Golden Bowl'' probably won't change anyone's minds on the subject. But if this handsome, faithful, intelligent screen adaptation of the novel doesn't leave you devastated, its ominous sense of a rarefied moral and aesthetic world bending before the accelerating streetcar of history will leave you with a mournful sense of loss.''The Golden Bowl'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has one fairly explicit sex scene.

Mel Brooks may not be making movies nowadays. But were he to dream up a spoof of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, it would probably have the same madcap esprit as Peter Askin and Douglas McGrath's nonsensical comedy ''Company Man.'' Only 81 minutes long, the movie is little more than a loose-jointed succession of goofy ''Saturday Night Live''-style sketches and sight gags inspired by an actual event that is nearly half a century behind us. In sending up the pomposity and ineptitude of the C. I. A.'s engineers in an embarrassing military debacle and the agency's loony schemes to eliminate Fidel Castro, the jokes are so broad that the humor barely qualifies as satire. Absurdist historical farce is more like it. Played with a maniacal glee by an all-star cast that features Mr. McGrath, Sigourney Weaver and John Turturro, the movie often feels semi-improvised. The story follows the unlikely ascent within the C. I. A. of Allen Quimp (Mr. McGrath), the nerdiest, dippiest, most underachieving early-1960's square ever to don a madras jacket and grumble about the misuse of the English language. Allen couldn't care less about political and social issues. What really gets his goat is the widespread ignorance of the proper use of objective pronouns, especially the misapplication of who and whom. Conversations with Allen stop in their tracks and turn into impromptu soap-box sermons on proper English usage when he hears a who where there ought to be a whom. In his personal hit parade of intolerable linguistic outrages, the confusion of lay and lie comes in a close second. Allen's transcendent nerdiness and lack of ambition embarrasses not only his buttoned-down, conservative family but also his nagging wife, Daisy (Ms. Weaver), a snooty socialite who might be described as a walking shopping list of luxury goods he can't afford. Pressed by Daisy to get a real job (one that pays six figures and ensures ulcers) and desperate to complete his masterwork, ''The Grammar Crisis in the English-Speaking World,'' which he is convinced will change the course of world history, Allen stalls for time by lying to Daisy. He confides that his teaching job is only a cover for his secret employment by the C. I. A. Impressed and relieved, Daisy immediately spreads the news of Allen's secret identity all over Washington. Few are inclined to believe him, however, until a visiting Soviet ballet dancer, Rudolph Petrov (Ryan Phillippe), whom Allen is instructing in a driver's ed class, impulsively decides to defect and Allen is handed the credit. Hastily inducted into the C. I. A. for real, he is shipped off to Cuba, which the powers-that-be consider a no-account backwater where he can conveniently fade away. But history seems to have insidious ways of following him around. Cuba's reputation as nowheresville owes to misinformation supplied by the snobbish American ambassador (an uncredited and very funny Woody Allen), who smugly basks in dreams of his former glory days as a diplomat in Paris as the Cuban revolution gathers force literally outside his windows. Later we learn that he consumes daily doses of LSD along with the fine French wine that is his particular obsession. Once in Cuba, Allen teams up with Agent Johnson (Mr. Turturro), a bloodthirsty, rabid anti-Communist patriot. We also meet Fidel Castro (Anthony LaPaglia) and the deposed dictator Fulgencio Batista (Alan Cumming). Grinning mischievously, Batista, whom the movie portrays as a leering, effeminate dandy, prances around Havana unrecognized in silly disguises that include a twirling paste-on handlebar mustache. The main body of the story finds Allen and his colleagues improvising and botching one ludicrous scheme after another to embarrass or assassinate Castro. The dirty tricks include an attempted LSD ambush, a box of poisoned cigars and a powerful depilatory that ends up catastrophically applied to the wrong head. The movie is largely carried by Mr. McGrath's Allen and Ms. Weaver's Daisy, both of whom convey a tongue-in-cheek knowingness. Ms. Weaver's Daisy is, in particular, a gleefully lighthearted monster who dispenses withering insults with the sunny insouciance of someone dishing out flattery. Mr. Turturro's roaring Agent Johnson and Mr. LaPaglia's Castro, by contrast, are flat, one-dimensional cartoons, and Mr. Cumming's twinkling, decadent Batista is a role he has played several times before.''Company Man'' leaves you wondering why it was made at all. Like ''Dick,'' Andrew Fleming's 1999 spoof of Watergate, it seems to labor under the delusion that a historical event, in this case the Bay of Pigs invasion, is unfinished business with an inside story that still hasn't been told. Audiences over 50 will relish its humor, which is consistent enough to keep things airborne much of the time. But it is hard to imagine what everybody else will make of this piece of froth, which is essentially an elongated revue sketch.''Company Man'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

It's one thing to be thousands of miles removed from the strife in the Balkans while watching it on television and quite another to live just across the border from it. Barbara Albert's complex, fragmentary debut film, ''Northern Skirts,'' which New Directors/New Films is screening tonight and on Friday night, evokes the social and emotional tremors that rumble through a southern Austrian town near the Slovenian border. The movie, which examines the relationships among some young people (several of them refugees), suggests how a war can sneak across the border, even when no shots are fired, and erode an orderly society's everyday sense of its own continuity. The movie's central character, Jasmin (Nina Proll), is a reckless young bakery worker who lives in painfully cramped quarters with her parents and four siblings. Upon discovering that she is pregnant, Jasmin tells two different boyfriends that they are the father. Callously rebuffed by both, she decides to have an abortion. Later, after a family squabble, she leaves home to live on her own and continues to indulge in the careless behavior that got her into trouble in the first place. Her self-destructive binge reaches a crisis when she is discovered unconscious in the snow by a young Balkan refugee who quickly becomes her newest boyfriend. Although the movie in no way endorses Jasmin's carelessness, her character is a long way from being a bad-girl cliche. Directionless and largely unformed, angry at her dictatorial father and hungry for affection, she is a loose wire flapping about for a connection. It almost doesn't matter to what or to whom. Her slovenly ways are also indicative of a jittery, nihilistic atmosphere that that the war next door has triggered. Jasmin ends up sharing an apartment with Tamara (Edita Malovcic), a Balkan refugee whom she met at the abortion clinic and who has found temporary employment at a hospital as a nurse's aide. In fleeing the former Yugoslavia, Tamara left behind a life to which she frustratedly tries to stay connected via telephone. The movie reminds us of the contradictory quality of modern telecommunications, which provide the illusion of being there even though the people we are watching on television and talking with on the phone are physically inaccessible. Every few minutes the movie cuts away from its characters to show the ongoing television coverage of events in the Balkans. For all the subtlety with which ''Northern Skirts'' evokes the social disruption in this rather seedy Austrian town, its examination of intersecting lives is too haphazard for most of the characters or their relationships to be anything but sketchy, and this fragmentary narrative style results in some confusion. At the same time ''Northern Skirts'' avoids becoming involved in any political crossfire. The war in the Balkans could be any war.

FILM REVIEW; Two Unlikely Candidates To Win Mr. Congeniality - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from October 1, 1999, Section E, Page 25Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. If ''Happy, Texas,'' a risk-free satire that picked up some positive buzz at this year's Sundance Film Festival, catches the public's fancy, it will be because the nonsensical story of a pair of crooks ducking the law in a small Texas town is so soft-hearted it wouldn't hurt a fly. Almost everybody in this not-so-funny comedy is giddy and cuddlesome with a gosh-oh-gee enthusiasm that is at first engaging, but quickly becomes a sign of a desperation to be liked. In portraying itinerant fishes out of water with a twist of sexual ambiguity, the movie belongs roughly to the same school of comedy as ''The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'' and ''To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar.''But ''Happy, Texas'' lacks the audacity and pathos of ''Priscilla'' and the funky drag humor of ''Wong.'' In addressing attitudes toward homosexuality in rural Texas, the movie pretends that rabid gay-bashing doesn't exist in the area. And one scene, set in a country-and-western bar packed with male couples strutting the Texas two-step, suggests that the region has a booming gay culture. The movie's portrayal of a children's beauty pageant, a juicy target for satire in the age of JonBenet Ramsey, is more celebratory than mocking. It all begins when Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn), two convicts on the lam, go through the contents of the Winnebago they have just stolen and discover that its owners are a gay male couple who travel around the country producing pageants. Stopped by the sheriff, Chappy Dent (William H. Macy), the pair are shocked to find that instead of being arrested, they are escorted to Happy, Tex., and welcomed as the potential miracle workers who can whip the Little Miss Squeezed Pageant into professional enough shape for the town to make the regional finals. Harry, the smarter of the two, instantly grasps the situation and convinces the reluctant Wayne that they should go along with this case of mistaken identity and muddle through. This means not only staging the pageant, but also pretending to be lovers. And in having them play gay, the movie deserves a round of applause for not requiring Mr. Northam and Mr. Zahn to fall back on offensive, limp-wristed stereotypes. While awkwardly demonstrating signs of connubial attachment, they remain more or less themselves. Mr. Northam and Mr. Zahn play together reasonably well without demonstrating the chemistry of natural comic partners. Mr. Northam's Harry is so impossibly suave and courtly, he is almost James Bond-like, while Mr. Zahn's Wayne is goofy, a macho Don Knotts with muscles and tattoos. None other than the sheriff gets a crush on Harry and meekly asks him out. Later in a moment of doe-eyed adoration, he gives him a rabbit's foot. Harry slyly strings Chappy along while wooing the beautiful local banker (Ally Walker), whose institution he plans to rob. Meanwhile, Mr. Zahn, in the movie's funniest role, tries to direct a roomful of eager little girls while their supervisor, Ms. Schaefer (Illeana Douglas) gazes on admiringly. When the time comes, Harry and Wayne have little trouble convincing their designated sweethearts that they're not really gay.''Happy, Texas,'' directed by Mark Illsley from a screenplay he wrote with Ed Stone and Phil Reeves, builds up expectations of a cathartic comic explosion with the staging of the pageant. But when the big moment comes, the movie blows its opportunity. The event ought to be a hilarious catastrophe. But in turning away from the parading little misses to focus on a car chase and a bungled bank robbery, ''Happy, Texas'' abruptly fizzles out.''Happy, Texas'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes sexual situations and some strong language.

"FILM REVIEW; Am Streetwise, a Little Naive, Will Travel - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from June 4, 1999, Section E, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. If you can accept the artifice of a movie that deftly compacts several overlapping genres, ''Finding North,'' the newest film to feature that comically mismatched couple du jour, a gay man and a straight woman, has its small wacky charms. The movie, which opens today at the Quad Cinemas, is a buddy movie, a road movie and a screwball comedy rolled into one calculating, sentimental little package. The pairing is so patly conceived that you could easily imagine these two eventually joining ''Will and Grace'' on the small screen. Its orderly wisecracks suggest the story was originally conceived for the stage. The unlikely traveling companions who fly from New York to Texas are Rhonda Portelli (Wendy Makkena), a loquacious bank teller from Brooklyn who loses her job on her 30th birthday, and Travis Furlong (John Benjamin Hickey), a suicidal yuppie who recently lost his lover to AIDS. In this anti-Cinderella yarn, the roles are reversed when Rhonda retrieves Prince Charming's missing shoe from the Brooklyn Bridge, where she happened to be in a car near the ledge where he stood and contemplated jumping. Rhonda is a wisecracking, salt-of-the-pavement type of gal who still lives with her parents. And in the movie's most tiresome conceit, no matter where she is or what she is doing, Rhonda is besieged by telephone calls from her nagging mother (Angela Pietropinto), who is always shown sitting on the same couch beside her catatonic husband. These scenes demonstrate that the cell phone, having added to the petty annoyances of daily life, is well on its way to becoming an equally ubiquitous (and annoying) sitcom prop. For someone as streetwise as Rhonda, it takes a ridiculous amount of time to discover that Travis (whom she fancies as exactly her type) is gay. In fact, it isn't until she has dogged him all the way to Texas that he tells her. You see, Texas is where Travis's late lover Bobby grew up. Just as Travis is about to swallow some sleeping pills, a package arrives containing a cassette in which Bobby (the voice of Jonathan Walker) instructs Travis to visit his hometown and settle some unfinished personal business. Once there, Rhonda and Travis find themselves embarking on a kind of treasure hunt in which they visit the personal landmarks of Bobby's youth and at each stop pick up a new cassette giving further instructions. They also decide they like each other a little. It helps that Rhonda's romantic frustrations are mollified by the motel owner's hunky son, an eye-batting Li'l Abner-type who takes an instant shine to her. The Texan characters all tend to be good-hearted drawling yokels. Nothing about ''Finding North,'' directed by Tanya Wexler from a screenplay by Kim Powers, is remotely credible. But as the movie babbles along, it maintains a head-in-the-clouds effervescence. Eventually Travis comes to the end of his odyssey in a cemetery with a gun in his hand. At this point, the movie turns into the cloyingly icky message film you knew it would become. In its own sitcom-y way, ''Finding North'' effuses the fizz of an updated Doris Day-Rock Hudson comedy, but with a Valerie Harper-Cyndi Lauper hybrid as the female lead. If Mr. Hickey doesn't have much more to do but mope and crab (which he does convincingly and with dignity), Ms. Makkena succeeds in making her abrasive urban naif almost likable.

FILM REVIEW; Defending a Son's Honor at All Costs - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from April 30, 1999, Section E, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. David Mamet's handsome, stately adaptation of Terence Rattigan's play ''The Winslow Boy'' does not embellish upon its source material. Instead it skillfully pares the play down to its essentials, arriving at a faithful but tighter version of this drama about a family defending the honor of its young son. Especially notable for their absence are Mr. Rattigan's stage directions about the characters' emotions, the ones specifying when anger or relief, humility or confidence is an appropriate reaction. Mr. Mamet likes his principals trickier than that. While ''The Winslow Boy'' affords no gamesmanship on a par with other Mamet films like ''The Spanish Prisoner,'' it works as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which truth and deceit are all-important. Mr. Rattigan's 1946 play was based on the 1910 trial of George Archer-Shee, a 13-year-old cadet at the Osborne Naval Academy who was accused of stealing a five-shilling postal order. The boy's father, a Liverpool bank manager, went to enormous lengths to argue his son's case in what became a cause celebre. The family enlisted the barrister who had prosecuted Oscar Wilde in a notorious libel suit. The film's deliberate reserve makes the nuances of this situation especially delicate. It is set in motion when the schoolboy Ronnie Winslow (Guy Edwards) returns home unexpectedly -- the mysterious curtain-raising event for Mr. Rattigan, and one that Mr. Mamet manipulates with greater suspense. By the time Ronnie arrives, the rest of his family has been introduced: cigarette-smoking suffragist sister Catherine (Rebecca Pidgeon), wayward brother Dickie (Matthew Pidgeon), refined mother (Gemma Jones) and stern patriarch (Nigel Hawthorne). Another Mamet touch is giving the father, Arthur Winslow, a casual opening reference to the biblical dream of seven fat years followed by seven lean ones. The Winslows' lean years begin when Ronnie arrives, reveals the theft and is asked by his father whether he is guilty. The inquiry is staged with enough cool understatement to lend a shade of ambiguity to Ronnie's denial, and to the family maneuverings that follow. By keeping his expert cast so carefully in check, Mr. Mamet trades in the possibility of high drama for a more quietly piercing approach. As the Winslows grow determined to defend Ronnie at all costs, the film fosters tension without ever making a histrionic move. As in ''The Spanish Prisoner,'' the defiantly arch acting style of the filmmaker's wife, Ms. Pidgeon, is central to the overall tone. Ms. Pidgeon defines the film's eccentricity by ignoring the conventional aspects of a character (a young woman with strong ideals and several different suitors) who might well have been played in more heated fashion. Instead, she spars dryly with the story's many male characters, not least of them Jeremy Northam as the famed barrister who deigns to take Ronnie's case. Her prickly manner once again risks throwing audiences off balance. Nonetheless, she bristles most effectively and plays Catherine with strong presence and a sharp, lucid edge. Mr. Hawthorne, in a wonderful performance, inhabits the role of Arthur Winslow with wry urbanity and stirring conviction, fully capturing the weight of what the Winslows endure. The case brings financial hardship, alters what was once Catherine's putatively bright future, and rocks everyone's confidence in law, justice and royal authority. Arthur handles all of this with an Edwardian dignity that is heightened by the film's own brand of reserve: keeping the events of the case and the public clamor it causes at a deliberate remove, Mr. Mamet compresses vital plot developments into glimpses of headlines and editorial cartoons, and lets major news arrive almost casually from the family's memorable maid (Sarah Flind).''The Winslow Boy'' is photographed, with a deliberate debt to John Singer Sargent's composition and lighting, by Benoit Delhomme, whose work on ''The Scent of Green Papaya,'' ''Cyclo'' and the forthcoming ''Loss of Sexual Innocence'' is striking for its radiant beauty. Though tethered to the past, it is mindful of the present-day implications of its story. A scene in which a reporter visits the Winslow home and casually demolishes their privacy is artfully staged, carefully balanced, and fresh as ever. THE WINSLOW BOYDirected by David Mamet; written by Mr. Mamet, based on the play by Terence Rattigan; director of photography, Benoit Delhomme; edited by Barbara Tulliver; music by Alaric Jans; production designer, Gemma Jackson; produced by Sarah Green; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

FILM REVIEW; Rob Reiner Directs A Contemporary Fable - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from July 22, 1994, Section C, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Rob Reiner has made both big, high-profile Hollywood movies (""A Few Good Men,"" ""When Harry Met Sally . . . "") and more offbeat films with funny, knowing, youthful sensibilities all their own (""Stand by Me,"" ""The Sure Thing,"" ""This Is Spinal Tap""). The latter ones are much more interesting, even when, like ""North,"" they're quite literally all over the map.""North,"" a playful modern fable about a boy in search of new parents, doesn't always work, but much of it is clever in amusingly unpredictable ways. Mr. Reiner's daring is a great comic asset, and it's very much in evidence here. So evident, in fact, that ""North"" has the scattershot energy of a Mel Brooks farce: before the audience can be sure whether one gambit really works, this film is on to the next one. It's hard to resist a comedy that's so full of surprises and so eager to please. Based on a slender novel by the comedy writer Alan Zweibel (of ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""It's Garry Shandling's Show""), and written by Mr. Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman, ""North"" unfolds in a fast, jaunty style. A string of quick glimpses describe North's happy-looking life in the fourth grade (""North's Tevye moved me,"" says a classmate of North's triumphant performance in ""Fiddler on the Roof"") while also revealing trouble in paradise. North (Elijah Wood) looks like a big success, but his parents (Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jason Alexander) don't understand him. Nor do they even notice him. North's father is much too interested in his career as an inspector of pants, which is the kind of notion Mr. Reiner knows just what to do with. All he needs to show is a quick glimpse of the pants factory, where North's father (one of many imaginative pants testers) tries out pink and blue evening pants by feigning ballroom dancing. Another nice sight gag presents North on his way to the secret place where he goes when he wants to be alone. Through the woods, past a treehouse, North wanders the countryside until he winds up inside a furniture store at a shopping mall, where he can brood undisturbed in a nice big armchair. It's there that he meets Bruce Willis, an Easter Bunny full of advice and badly in need of a shave. Mr. Willis, lending the film a touch of hip insouciance, turns up in many guises throughout the film and makes a nicely laid-back guardian angel. North decides to seek freedom from his family and roam the world in search of new parents. Naturally, he can't do this without a lawyer (Jon Lovitz, who shows up in school with his client and advises him not to answer a question about the inventor of the cotton gin). And he can't do it without generating public interest: telephone operators are seen fielding calls from prospective parents who want to know everything about North. ""Don't even get him started on the Warren Commission,"" one operator advises. Much of the film strings together North's geographical exploits, which take him to places including Texas (Dan Aykroyd, Reba McIntyre, shades of ""Dallas"" and ""Bonanza""), Alaska (Kathy Bates and Graham Greene in an igloo with a garage-door opener) and Pennsylvania's Amish country (Kelly McGillis and Alexander Godunov, who give a reprise of their ""Witness"" roles and scare North with an offer to make him part of their solemn brood). Some of these moments are a lot less funny than others. The film's comic range goes all the way from tasteless jokes in Hawaii, where North's prospective parents want to use his bare rump on billboards, to a quick, side-splitting scene in Paris, where North sits with a beret-wearing couple watching Jerry Lewis on every television station. Mr. Wood is currently the most natural, confident child actor of his generation, but he's not always an ideal straight man. Too many of the tall tales in ""North"" require him to sit still and just flinch in disbelief. However, he's very likable throughout, and Mr. Reiner has surrounded him with a good deal of comic relief. The film gets some extra energy from Alan Arkin, turning himself into Sid Caesar to play a wild-eyed judge, and Mr. Lovitz, sleazy as ever and better used than he was in ""City Slickers II."" Mr. Alexander and Ms. Louis-Dreyfus also have some funny moments, even if they spend much of the story installed in the Smithsonian, enjoying ""the longest simultaneous coma in medical history.""""North"" also has a subplot in which the hero's power-mad classmate, a venal pre-yuppie named Winchell (Mathew McCurley), schemes against him. Children may enjoy this character, but there's a lot for children to enjoy in ""North"" anyway. Aside from being the least original part of an otherwise inventive story, this conventional twist bogs down the film in other ways. There are enough large, venal yuppies on screen these days. We don't need small ones.""North"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity.

"Review/Film; A Land Grab, This Time In Vermont - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from March 4, 1994, Section C, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The real-life story behind ""Where the Rivers Flow North"" is the stuff of independent film makers' fantasies. A Vermonter named Jay Craven put together the money for his film from a variety of sources, ranging from foreign sales rights to local small investors, and made the kind of period piece that would be produced in Hollywood only as a fluke. Based on Howard Frank Mosher's regional novella, the film is set in 1927 and centers on two unlikely characters. Noel Lord (Rip Torn), an old man with white hair flowing below his shoulders and a metal hook for a hand, has lived on his land all his life and is resisting a power company's attempt to take it over. An Indian woman named Bangor (Tantoo Cardinal) has been with him as housekeeper and lover for decades. She wears a man's crushed hat, is missing a front tooth and holds no illusions about the need to take the power company's money and go. Mr. Craven, who directed and co-wrote the script, also persuaded Michael J. Fox and Treat Williams to appear in small roles. There is so much good will behind the scenes that it seems heartless to say ""Where the Rivers Flow North"" is as pretty and as flat as a Vermont postcard. But in truth, there isn't much to recommend it beyond Ms. Cardinal's performance and some rich potential that never comes to life. Ms. Cardinal gives Bangor a freshness rarely seen on screen. She refers to Lord as ""mister"" and herself as ""her,"" but her dialect is the least of her uniqueness. She is so tough and blunt that when she begins to cry about the children she never had, it becomes clear that emotion has been a luxury in her hardscrabble life. But her character only suggests the depths that the film fails to reach. Mr. Craven directs as if the story could tell itself, without any hand to guide its dramatic structure. Mr. Torn grumbles his way through the role, and Mr. Fox appears briefly in a few short scenes as a merciless power-company executive. For sheer drama, ""Where the Rivers Flow North"" is no match for the story of its conception. Where the Rivers Flow North Directed by Jay Craven; written by Mr. Craven and Don Bredes, based on the novella by Howard Frank Mosher; director of photography, Paul Ryan; edited by Barbara Tulliver; music by the Horse Flies with Ben Wittman; production designer, David Wasco; produced by Bess O'Brien and Mr. Craven; released by Caledonia Pictures.

‘Retaliation’ Review: To Suffer Silently or Take Revenge? - The New York Times,"typical of the film’s blunt symbolism — involves tearing down a church. At a pub, Malky spots the priest (James Smillie) who abused him. The sighting brings Malky’s 25 years of silent suffering to a boil. That torment has already affected his relationship with the bartender (Janet Montgomery), whom he’s been seeing on and off; his best friend (well-played by the raffish Alex Ferns); and his mother (Anne Reid), whose own guilt makes her reluctant to acknowledge the abuse. Malky, initially drawn to revenge, confronts his tormentor with a sledgehammer. But the screenplay, by Geoff Thompson, offers Malky an opportunity to avoid violence in the form of another abuse survivor (Charlie Creed-Miles) who found religion in prison and wants to help Malky. “Retaliation” settles on what feels like an easy way out: Malky expels his demons with implausible abruptness, while a fiery finale strains credulity to the breaking point, even as it allows the movie a bracing cut to black. Mostly, “Retaliation” accords Bloom a chance to deliver some impressive, anguished monologues, although the scenes focusing on those around him (particularly a late conversation between Montgomery and Ferns’s characters) hint at a more expansive, unrealized complexity. RetaliationRated R. Violence, descriptions of abuse and their legacies. Running time: 1 hour 31 minutes.

"‘The Outpost’ Review: At War, in a Worst-Case Scenario - The New York Times","The casting of this war movie, set in Afghanistan in 2009, has novelty appeal. Two members of the ensemble, Scott Eastwood and Milo Gibson, are sons of famous actor-directors (Clint and Mel) who have made their own war films. Another player, Will Attenborough, is the grandson of Richard, a star of the World War II drama “The Great Escape.” And James Jagger’s father, Mick, while more a stage than screen figure, sometimes still sings of riding a tank and holding a general’s rank. In a lesser film such family ties and resemblances could be a distraction, but in this well-crafted, fact-based tragedy of errors, they provide added value. When Eastwood’s character, the real-life Staff Sgt. Clint Romesha, is briefed on rules of engagement, he says of the general who ordered them, “Someone tell McChrystal that we’re not selling Popsicles out here, sir.” His line reading redefines “chip off the old block.” Adapted from a nonfiction book by Jake Tapper and directed by Rod Lurie, “The Outpost” evolves from what initially feels like a collection of war-movie commonplaces, highlighting crude-talking soldiers in a bad situation, into something more complex and illuminating. The men of this outpost are assigned to work with the local population. But they are sitting ducks both existentially and geographically. Their station is in a valley surrounded by mountains, just waiting to be overrun by Taliban fighters. The movie uses unusual techniques (for example, allotting discrete sequences to whoever is in charge of the outpost at any given time) to unfold its narrative. On top of that, two members of the ensemble who are not sons of celebs, Orlando Bloom as a determined commander and Caleb Landry Jones as a wound-up specialist, also deliver near-career-high performances. The OutpostRated R for language, wartime violence. Running time: 2 hours 3 minutes.

‘The Nightcrawlers’ and ‘Lost and Found’ Review: Short Documentaries Tackle Big Issues - The New York Times,"Two short documentaries from National Geographic will screen together this week at the Metrograph. Both involve international human rights issues, but the films aren’t especially complementary. The longer and more substantial of the pair is “The Nightcrawlers,” a ground-level look at the violent antidrug campaign waged by President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. Human rights groups estimate that police and vigilantes have killed thousands accused of dealing or using drugs. The director Alexander A. Mora crosscuts between two groups: photojournalists who have brought images of the brutality to a global public, and anonymous or pseudonymous vigilantes. Ignoring due process does not seem to trouble the second group. “If the police cannot touch you, we are the ones sent to kill you,” one says. A man presented as a vigilante commander says that he also earns money taking tourists around an island. Another man identified as a vigilante claims that police helped cover up a mistaken hit by his outfit. Mora might have provided more information on how he secured his eyebrow-raising access. And much of what we see is presented with frustratingly little context. Near the end, Mora cuts to black as shots ring out. We’re left wondering whether anyone was killed. “Lost and Found” is a profile of Kamal Hussein, who works at a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh to reunite children with their parents. The director, Orlando von Einsiedel, who won an Oscar for “The White Helmets” in 2017, emphasizes the nobility of Hussein’s calling but offers little else. The credits cite the involvement of the Nobel Prize organization in the movie’s production, but Von Einsiedel’s sentimental purview and manipulative scoring suggest his main goal is winning another Oscar.

"Review: ‘Unlocked,’ a New Spy Thriller, Same as the Old Spy Thrillers - The New York Times","“unlock” in spy-speak — a courier whose message could set the plan in motion, or stop it. And here the movie goes very old school, piling on spy thriller tropes: double crosses; chases; a stock taciturn white-haired would-be assassin (who, conveniently enough, can’t quite draw a bead on our heroine); an eager recruit who might as well be nicknamed Dead Meat; and dialogue like “I’m thinking I’m the only friend you’ve got.” I suppose this went down easily enough for me because I grew up with this kind of stuff, and can surrender to it as a kind of cinematic comfort food. But still. For those not so inclined, the entertainment value could conceivably be derived from the brisk, no-nonsense direction by Michael Apted, and the talents of what they used to call “an all-star cast” — in this case, Michael Douglas, Toni Collette, John Malkovich and Orlando Bloom.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/31/movies/unlocked-review-noomi-rapace.html
Review: ‘Mean Dreams’ Presents Lovers on the Lam With Quiet Skill - The New York Times,"young lovers on the lam (see: “Badlands”) — but it does so with such quiet, gently appealing assurance that it makes the template seem fresh again. Jonas (Josh Wiggins, who made an effective screen debut in “Hellion” in 2014) is a 15-year-old high school dropout working on his parents’ struggling farm when he meets Casey (the Canadian actress Sophie Nélisse, from “The Book Thief”), who with her father has just moved in down the road. Casey’s dad, Wayne, an abusive alcoholic and corrupt sheriff (a bristling Bill Paxton, in one of his final film roles), has ties to drug runners. When Jonas overhears Wayne killing some of his criminal acquaintances, he plots an escape for Casey from her domestic hell. He steals a bag of drug money from Wayne, and soon the young couple, with dreams of finding freedom by the ocean, are hounded by the sheriff and his police accomplice (Colm Feore). Mr. Morlando — working with his skilled cinematographer, Steve Cosens, from a tight script by Kevin Coughlin and Ryan Grassby — capitalizes on rural Canadian locations in autumn and the chemistry of his young, talented stars. As the bravura composition of the group-murder sequence illustrates, Mr. Morlando knows how to stage a scene with tasteful understatement. Without stooping to titillation, he underscores the bond between Jonas and Casey, whose fate, though far from secure, leaves the viewer with hope and with cherished memories of their company.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/movies/mean-dreams-review-bill-paxton.html
"‘Virunga,’ a Searing Documentary Set in Congo - The New York Times","and protected — Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, home to many of the world’s last mountain gorillas and the region’s best hope for economic stability. In a country already weakened by a tumultuously bloody history (outlined in a brief prologue), that hope became even more fragile with the 2010 discovery of oil beneath Lake Edward and the arrival of a British petroleum company, SOCO International. As multiple forces collided for control of the park — including a powerful rebel group seeking a percentage of oil profits — Mr. von Einsiedel and his crew members (who had originally planned a film about the dangerous work of the park’s 400 rangers) found themselves caught in a literal war between conservation and exploitation. Using hidden cameras and the invaluable assistance of the fearless French journalist Mélanie Gouby, Mr. von Einsiedel mixes extraordinary footage of rebel tanks and clandestine palm-greasing with lush panoramas of serene wildlife. Villains, it seems, are everywhere, but it’s the film’s heroes who stick in the mind: Andre Bauma, the gentle ranger who would die to protect the orphaned gorillas in his care; Emmanuel de Merode, the park’s soft-spoken Belgian warden, whose astonishing courage calms everyone around him; and Rodrigue Katembo, a section chief trying to gather evidence of illegal oil company activities. “I am not special,” he insists.

‘Arise’ Turns a Lens on Female Environmentalists - The New York Times,"The documentary “Arise,” which celebrates women around the world leading movements in environmental protection, might reach a broader audience were its filmmaking more vibrant. A shame, because its message is worthy. Starhawk, from the San Francisco area, perhaps best captures the spirit of this gentle film when she speaks of women’s natural role in finding a “mosaic of solutions” to a planetary crisis. But saving the planet begins with saving a community, and “Arise” presents inspiring segments featuring diverse saviors and locales, like Judy Nyguthi Kimano in Kenya, Majora Carter in the South Bronx and Monica Chuji in Ecuador. I was most touched by Aida Shibli, a Palestinian Bedouin in Israel who feels strongly about guarding unattended land. “It’s very urgent for me,” Ms. Shibli says, tears barely at bay. “Arise” honors women as protectors, nurturers and activists, and words like “empower” and “sustainable” get a workout. There are images of women hunched studiously over electronics or linking hands to face the sun. Nature, of course, receives loving, reverent attention. The film, narrated by Daryl Hannah, uses thesis-driven poetry to link the segments; at these moments, there’s a sense of watching an overearnest public service message scored by the softest world-music sounds from Lilith Fair. Still, “Arise” always feels unified, a genuinely felt and executed womanist letter to the world. The segment with Ms. Carter in the Bronx especially provides hope, as it flashes back to the Victory Gardens efforts in the United States during World War II.

"Orlando Bloom, in ‘The Good Doctor,’ Sends Danger Signals - The New York Times","Heaven forbid that anyone should have the misfortune to be treated by a physician like Martin Blake (Orlando Bloom), the poker-faced new resident in internal medicine at a Southern California hospital in “The Good Doctor.” With his ferretlike eyes; thin, unsmiling lips; and tense body language, Martin is such a cold fish he can barely manage a smile. An early indication that something might be seriously wrong with him is a glimpse of his sterile, sparsely furnished, all-white beach-side apartment, which looks more like a laboratory than a home. By the time that Diane Nixon (Riley Keough), a beautiful 18-year-old patient with a kidney ailment, comes under his spell, other clues have been dropped, including his serious bungling of another patient’s medication. But Diane, who develops an instant crush on Martin, recovers under his ministrations and is discharged. Her father is so grateful that he invites the good doctor over for a thank-you dinner during which Martin slips off to the bathroom to examine the medicine cabinet. Finding Diane’s prescription, he substitutes another medication in the bottle. It isn’t long before she relapses and returns to the hospital under his too-loving care. Her condition steadily worsens. This mildly creepy psychological thriller, directed by Lance Daly from a screenplay by John Enbom, is not a full-scale medical horror movie like “Coma,” which depicted the modern hospital (of the late 1970s) as a grisly house of horrors and which has been remade as an A&E mini-series that has its premiere on Monday. Martin is one of only two bad apples in a seemingly exemplary institution. The other baddie is Jimmy, a cocky, drug-addicted orderly (Michael Peña) whom Martin catches having sex with a patient in a supply room. Jimmy later blackmails Martin into supplying him with Oxycodone. The danger signals that Martin emits are so badly misread by the hospital staff that his unearned respect lends the movie an undertone of gallows humor. His chilly formality is seen as professional objectivity, and his seemingly dogged pursuit of the causes of Diane’s “resistance to treatment” is viewed as thoroughness by his supervisor (Rob Morrow). But “The Good Doctor” doesn’t go nearly far enough in exploring Martin’s motives. Is he a sociopath and a potential serial killer? A ruthless professional climber who will do anything to gain respect? A romantic control freak willing to risk the life of a patient to maintain his hold over her? Ultimately, even after momentarily falling apart in a fit of paranoia, Martin remains a cipher in a movie that never fulfills its potential as melodrama. If “The Good Doctor” isn’t a bad movie, it tells only half the story. “The Good Doctor” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and mild violence.",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/movies/orlando-bloom-in-the-good-doctor-sends-danger-signals.html
"‘Citizen Gangster,’ With Scott Speedman as Edwin Boyd - The New York Times","“In war, there are no unwounded soldiers” — “Citizen Gangster” announces its sympathies. Drawing on the exploits of Edwin Boyd, a Canadian World War II veteran who became that country’s most infamous bank robber, this unusually cerebral crime movie chooses psychic pain over public-enemy thrills. That decision makes Boyd a more complex and less accessible antihero, and Scott Speedman plays him with a vulnerability that softens even his brief displays of aggression. When we meet Boyd in 1945, he’s a disgruntled Toronto bus driver, straining to support a wan wife (Kelly Reilly), two children and impossible dreams of an acting career. Eager for money and attention, he paints his face, grabs an old pistol and demands cash from an astonished bank teller: the beginning of a life that he’s ill equipped to handle. Refusing to burnish the myth of the romantic outlaw, the writer and director, Nathan Morlando, maintains a tone of persistent melancholy that tinges every scene with foreboding. As Boyd joins forces with other thieves, the gang’s adventures unspool without suspense or glorification; instead, Mr. Morlando’s chilly compositions, awash in shades of ice and shadow, emphasize Boyd’s increasingly narrow range of options and air of despondency. This has the unfortunate effect of draining energy from fine performances — especially those of Kevin Durand as a fellow criminal, and Brian Cox as Boyd’s judgmental father — and from a central character as desperate for limelight as lucre. Assembled with the help of telephone conversations between Mr. Morlando and his subject (who died in 2002), “Citizen Gangster” is a good-looking but passionless affair that remains stubbornly aloof from its audience. Only when we see Boyd, decked out in greasepaint and devilish grin, perform an impromptu soft-shoe shuffle on a bank counter, do we catch a peek of the performer who charmed as easily as he broke the law.",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/movies/citizen-gangster-with-scott-speedman-as-edwin-boyd.html
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End - Movies - Review - The New York Times,"perhaps the only pirate movie to see the need for a Ferris wheel — Mr. Verbinski is reminding us why we should ever trust him again. This third and perhaps final episode in the swishy, swashbuckling saga goes some way toward achieving that goal. The cannibals, coconuts and landlocked locations have been replaced by the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. And the palpable relief as the myriad plotlines rush toward some semblance of resolution has made everyone quite giddy; even our passion-deferred lovers, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley), appear marginally less bored with each other. Or at least less bored than we are with them. Filmed sequentially with its predecessor, “At World’s End” is less concerned with ends than inversions, presenting a society where the lawless practice democracy and their rulers engage in tyranny. The crown has declared a state of emergency, civil rights have been suspended, and naysayers are lined up to be hanged. In one of the film’s most bizarre sequences, the condemned begin to sing, belting out a dirge among the rolling tumbrils and swaying nooses. (Tardy audience members may think they’ve stumbled into a performance of “Les Misérables” by mistake.) The song reaches Elizabeth, in a skiff heading for the Pirate Brethren Court in Shipwreck Cove, and for a while the movie becomes a watery opera with a distinctly Oriental flavor. By the time Chow Yun-Fat appears, as the grumpy pirate lord Sao Feng — complete with an entourage of old-Hollywood coolies — the Gilbert and Sullivan vibe is beginning to wear. After electing Elizabeth pirate king (the Brethren know who wears the trousers in this trilogy), the pirates set out to clobber the British before Davy Jones and his seafood-combo crew can do the same to them. This will require the help of the priestess Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), whose role has clarified but whose diction remains unintelligible. “Therr is a cahst to be ped en thah end,” she warns mysteriously, mangling her vowels like a voodoo version of Inspector Clouseau. Having blown Tia up to Godzilla size, however, the screenwriters, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, have no further use for her; in her new incarnation as the sorceress Calypso she amounts to little more than crabs and raging wind. Considering she is afforded only one conjugal visit every 10 years —and that from a man who breathes through a blowhole — her bad temper is entirely understandable. But what of Johnny Depp’s Capt. Jack Sparrow? Following his unfortunate encounter with a giant cephalopod at the end of the last movie, this one finds him trapped and hallucinating in Davy Jones’s Locker, an arid limbo of rolling dunes and raging heat. Because he is Jack, his hallucinations are all about himself (the real love affair in these movies has always been between Jack and his mirror), and Mr. Verbinski fills the screen with an army of mincing clones in kohl eyeliner and fancy head scarves. Forever above the fray and beside the point, Mr. Depp’s devilish buccaneer is the lightfooted device that holds the franchise together; as he sashays from battle to bar, impervious to insult and musket alike, Jack’s very narcissism is his protection. He’s an inverse superhero. Though the film is filled with the expected special-effects wizardry, its most stunning and surreal moments are also the most peaceful: an army of crabs transporting the Black Pearl over dunes and into the ocean, and a flaming sunrise viewed through tattered seaweed sails. A disappointing cameo by Keith Richards, still alive and flaunting the look of hard-won dissipation that reportedly inspired Jack’s personal style, is in a special-effects category of its own. Perhaps he should have rented a copy of “Performance” and taken notes from Mick Jagger. Because of the abundance of unpleasant human characters, all of whom lie, cheat and betray one another at the drop of a flounder, the burden of creating an emotional connection with the audience must be borne, ironically, by characters whose humanity has long since evaporated. From the pathos of Davy — still playing the organ like an invertebrate Phantom of the Opera — to the tragic yearning in the barnacle-encrusted face of Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard), “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End” reminds us that great acting can transcend even the most elaborate makeup. Even so, if the story is to continue, its creators will need more than Jack’s limp wrists and Will’s limp resolve. In the prophetic words of Barbossa, “There’s never a guarantee of comin’ back, but passin’ on — that’s certain.”“Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest - Review - Movies - The New York Times,"still less than $10 in most cities — and in return you get two and a half hours of spirited swashbuckling, with an all-star three-way battle of the cheekbones (Orlando Bloom vs. Keira Knightley vs. Johnny Depp) and some extra-slimy computer-generated imagery thrown in at no additional cost. But there's a catch, as there usually is. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is not just a movie. It's a glistening, sushi-grade chunk of franchise entertainment, which means that maximal enjoyment of it comes with certain obligations. It is the second episode in what will be at least a trilogy — the third installment is scheduled for release next summer — and full appreciation of its whirligig plot will depend on thorough acquaintance with the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" picture, conveniently available for purchase on DVD. And since ""Dead Man's Chest"" brazenly dispenses with the convention of an ending — it's pretty much all middle — you will, by virtue of buying that ticket, have committed yourself to buying another one a year from now if you're the least bit curious about how the whole thing turns out. By then, chances are good that you will have forgotten most of what happened in ""Dead Man's Chest,"" so you'll have another disc to add to the shopping cart. The question is: Is it worth it? The same thought probably crosses the minds of Disney theme-park vacationers as they endure endless lines for the ride on which the movies are based, but the notion is quickly banished because nobody likes to feel like a sucker. By a rational calculation of time and money — yours and the untold millions invested by Disney, the producer Jerry Bruckheimer and others — the answer is probably no. But hey, this isn't about that, right? It's about fun. You're there to have fun. Fun for the family. Fun for the kids. Fun for everyone. So shut up and have fun. And you probably will, even if it's hard to shake the feeling that you've been bullied into it. Gore Verbinski, the director, has an appropriate sense of mischief, as a well as a gift, nearly equaling those of Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg, for integrating CGI seamlessly into his cinematic compositions. What is curious about the recent crop of high-tech blockbusters is how seriously they take themselves, and unlike, say, ""Superman Returns,"" ""Dead Man's Chest"" cannot be called pretentious. It makes no claims to being about good and evil, the difficulty of saving the world in the modern era, or the inner lives of any of its characters. Instead, it sends Elizabeth Swann (Ms. Knightley) and Will Turner (Mr. Bloom), their wedding day ruined in an opening sequence that seems to pay tribute to the old Guns N' Roses ""November Rain"" video, on a search for the pirate captain Jack Sparrow (Mr. Depp). Jack, as usual, finds himself in all kinds of trouble, pursued not only by agents of the British crown, but also by an undead, squid-faced mariner, the famous Davy Jones, who commands a ghoulish crew of half-human, half-aquatic creatures. These sailors are like the cast of ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" — or the menu at a seafood restaurant —come to life: Night of the Living Bouillabaisse. One of them, played by Stellan Skarsgard with a starfish embedded in his face, is Will's long-lost father, a development that adds a gelatinous morsel of father-son pathos to the stew of plots and subplots cooked up by the screenwriters, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Davy Jones himself, meanwhile, speaks in the sinister whisper of Bill Nighy, though it is his swaying mass of facial tentacles that most viewers will remember. And there are other memorable bits and pieces, visual highlights of a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. Ms. Knightley is, once again, a vision of imperial British pluckiness, with an intriguing dash of romantic recklessness that surfaces toward the end. Mr. Bloom, as is his custom, leaps about, trying to overcome his incurable blandness, and is upstaged by special effects, musical cues, octopus tentacles and pieces of wood. Naomie Harris turns up for a few scenes of hammy voodoo, and Mackenzie Crook and David Bailie contribute some proletarian slapstick. Most of the other members of the first movie's cast show up again, sometimes in surprising circumstances. The franchise, of course, belongs to Jack Sparrow, and to Mr. Depp. Because this is a sequel, the role is no longer the splendid surprise it was in 2003, when ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" charmed audiences and disarmed critics on its way to the third-best domestic box-office gross of the year. But the best parts of ""Dead Man's Chest"" confirm Jack Sparrow as the most viable Disney cartoon character in quite some time, though his anarchic insouciance has more in common with the work of Chuck Jones or Tex Avery. Mr. Verbinski, for his part, grasps the kinship between today's computer-assisted filmmaking and the hand-drawn animation of old, which lies in the freedom to revise the laws of physics at will. Two sequences in particular stand out, and would stand alone nicely as shorts: I will always think of them as ""Fruit Kebab"" and ""Runaway Hamster Wheel."" But the easy delight that such flights of visual fancy inspires is crowded and blocked by all the other stuff going on in this long, ungainly movie, which for all its busy, buzzing parts, is incapable of standing on its own. It batters you with novelty and works so hard to top itself that exhaustion sets in long before the second hour is over. By next summer, I suppose, we'll all be rested and ready for more.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some violent action scenes, and a few moments of gruesome creepy-crawly movie horror.

FILM REVIEW; It's High Noon in the Australian Outback - The New York Times,"The 19th-century Australian outlaw Ned Kelly may be obscure to many Americans -- at least compared with homegrown folk heroes like Jesse James or Billy the Kid -- but the new movie that bears his name has a familiar rhythm and shape. Though the flora, the fauna and the accents may be exotic ''Ned Kelly,'' directed by Gregor Jordan and drawn from the novel ''Our Sunshine'' by Robert Drewe (rather than on Peter Carey's more recent, revisionist version of the story), has the look and feel of a classic western, as well as some of the genre's limitations. In Mr. Jordan's movie, from a screenplay by John Michael McDonagh, Ned (Heath Ledger) embodies the myth of the honest man driven to criminality by injustice. As a young man he is imprisoned on a false charge of horse stealing, and his hardworking family is subsequently harassed by corrupt law-enforcement officials. By the time he takes up bank robbing with a makeshift gang of loyal confederates, Kelly is like a cross between Pretty Boy Floyd and Spartacus, the bandit as social revolutionary and champion of the oppressed. Despite an ever-growing bounty on his head and legislation allowing any citizen to shoot him dead with impunity, the hard-bitten Irish ranchers and laborers of Victoria instinctively side with Ned against the territory's hated constables. The climactic shootout becomes an especially bloody engagement in a continuing class war, a bit like the convulsive riots at the end of Martin Scorsese's ''Gangs of New York.'' The officer charged with bringing Kelly down, a fish-eyed counterinsurgency expert played by Geoffrey Rush, makes this plain when he tells his men that Kelly's survival threatens not only lives and property but the very stability of the state. Mr. Jordan's ambition -- to turn Kelly's short, violent life into a political parable -- is admirable, but ''Ned Kelly,'' which opens nationwide today, falls short of realizing it. The storytelling is choppy and abrupt, and the filmmakers rely heavily on voice-over narration to announce themes that are never brought to dramatic life on screen. Mr. Ledger, his heartthrob charisma camouflaged behind a heavy beard (and, at the end, behind a makeshift iron mask), gives a stiff, hesitant performance. The film, shot in somber faded tones by Oliver Stapleton, revels in period details and in the harsh beauty of the Australian landscape. There are enough shots of lizards, birds and kangaroos to fill up an episode of ''The Crocodile Hunter,'' but the human characters continually threaten to fade into the background. Rachel Griffiths, known to HBO viewers as the volatile Brenda on ''Six Feet Under,'' has a jumpy cameo as a proper lady who wants to be a Kelly gang groupie. Orlando Bloom, as Kelly's loyal sidekick Joe Byrne, upstages Mr. Ledger in nearly every scene. Naomi Watts, who plays Ned's aristocratic and clandestine love interest, brings a golden radiance to an underwritten part, and you wonder if she accepted it out of patriotic duty. The sentiments undergirding ''Ned Kelly'' are undeniably noble, and it is touching to see so many of the Australian actors who have lately conquered Hollywood standing tall on native soil. There is a potent national epic struggling to find expression here, but this movie is too rushed and fragmented to do it justice.''Ned Kelly'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence and brief nudity. NED KELLYDirected by Gregor Jordan; written by John Michael McDonagh, based on the novel ''Our Sunshine'' by Robert Drewe; director of photography, Oliver Stapleton; edited by Jon Gregory; music by Klaus Badelt; production designer, Steven Jones-Evans; produced by Nelson Woss and Lynda House; released by Focus Features.

"FILM REVIEW; It's Big, It's Bad, It's Mutating Protoplasm - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from June 8, 2001, Section E, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. In ''Evolution,'' Ivan Reitman's scattershot sci-fi comedy, Orlando Jones and David Duchovny play community college science instructors who happen upon an alien life-form that threatens to take over the world. A meteor has crashed into the Arizona desert. Examining the blue-green slime that oozes from beneath its surface (''It's a rock that bleeds!''), Mr. Duchovny's character, a disgraced former Pentagon biologist named Ira Kane, discovers a colony of squirming star-shaped amoebas. These quickly mutate into more complex microorganisms, and then into computer-animated flatworms, insects, slimy lizards and angry primates. The movie itself evolves in reverse, starting life as a moderately clever grab bag of high-concept noodling and half-witty badinage before descending into the primordial ooze of explosions and elaborate lower-intestinal gags. Mr. Duchovny and Mr. Jones make an amusing pair. Their interracial shtick is reminiscent of that of Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor in movies like ''Silver Streak'' and ''Stir Crazy,'' but with the ragged anxiety of the late 70's smoothed over by the referential pop-culture cool of the present day. Mr. Duchovny works hard to show some range beyond Agent Mulder's morbid intensity while still poking fun at his ''X-Files'' pedigree. ''No government,'' Ira snaps when Harry suggests alerting the federal authorities about their discovery. ''I know how those people operate.'' In his first scenes, Mr. Duchovny, who was a Ph. D. candidate in literature before becoming an alien tracker for the Fox network, captures the easygoing cynicism of the second-rate academic with frightening accuracy. Virtually everyone in his class gets an A, except for two obese brothers whose identical papers, titled ''Cells Are Bad,'' earn them C-minuses. But compared with Harry, Ira is Jonas Salk. Mr. Jones, best known as the demented pitchman for 7-Up, has quick timing and effortless improvisational flair, as well as an absolute, and in this case welcome, disregard for consistencies of character. Mr. Duchovny is constrained by a silly back story involving his mishandling of a Pentagon-sponsored anthrax vaccine (the laughs never stop!) and a love interest (played, for no good reason, by Julianne Moore); Mr. Jones is free to mug and gangle to his heart's content.''I've seen this movie,'' he says as an alien bug crawls around inside his protective suit. ''The black dude dies first.'' No, but he is subject to some fairly gross indignities: the bug must be extracted from his nether regions with forceps. Later, as payback, he administers a dandruff-shampoo enema to the shopping-mall-size mass of protoplasm that threatens civilization as we know it. Unfortunately, civilization as we know it -- that is, the highly evolved state of being that can find no better use for its biological advantages than the production of movies like this one -- triumphs in the end. That dandruff shampoo appears to be a clever product placement, a moment that the rest of the movie, for all its ickily impressive digital flora and fauna and its cast of good sports, rarely lives up to. Seann William Scott, in the designated-doofus (or David Arquette) role of a hapless aspiring firefighter, has some moments of slack-jawed charm. Ms. Moore falls down a lot and bumps into things. She's sexy, she's a scientist, she's clumsy; comic invention of this caliber makes you sorry the writers' strike never happened. From time to time an actor -- usually Mr. Duchovny, Mr. Jones or Ted Levine, who plays a Pentagon heavy -- will send up a tired action-movie or television-show commonplace: ''Let's do this!'' ''It's payback time!'' ''Be careful out there!'' But the spoofing of movie clichés has become a cliché in its own right, and beneath the hyperactivity of ''Evolution'' is an abiding laziness. In a Darwinian universe, this is a dangerous thing. The biggest frustration in ''Evolution'' is that it squanders an interesting premise. The aliens evolve so quickly, compressing hundreds of millions of years into a few short days, that you can't help wondering what they will look like when they turn into us. But we never get past the angry apes. Maybe in ''Evolution II'' the process of natural selection will be allowed to proceed further, and we can witness the full flowering of superior life-forms -- or at least see whether they have it in them to make better movies than this one.''Evolution'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some profanity and the usual gross-out humor.

"FILM REVIEW; New Money, Old Divides, High Hopes - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from April 3, 2001, Section E, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. The conflicts roiling inside Luigi (Silvio Orlando), the central character of Mimmo Calopresti's elliptical family drama, ''I Prefer the Sound of the Sea,'' might be seen as emblematic of the social divisions within Italy, a country whose northern and southern regions are as different from each other as those in the United States. A wealthy businessman living in Turin, Luigi grew up in the south, in the mostly rural, economically depressed region of Calabria, which forms the toe of Italy's ''boot.'' Returning there for a visit, he exudes the smug magnanimity of a poor boy returning in glory to the scene of his humble roots. Luigi's pride in having risen above his background is one reason he impulsively agrees to help a troubled distant relative, Rosario (Michele Raso), a handsome, unsmiling teenager whose mother was recently murdered and whose father is in prison. Luigi volunteers to bring Rosario back with him to Turin and enroll him in a school for troubled teenagers run by an old friend, Don Lorenzo (Mr. Calopresti), who is a priest. Luigi, who is estranged from his wife, is the father of a teenage son, Matteo (Paolo Cirio), Rosario's age, and he has high hopes that the two boys will become friends. The movie, filmed in muted colors by Luca Bigazzi, is a subtle but rambling exploration of how good intentions can go awry, especially if the assumptions underlying those intentions include an unconscious snobbery. The nouveau riche plushness of Luigi's life, it turns out, is far less secure than it initially seemed. The corporation for which he works has put him in charge of investigating and cleaning up some internal corruption, and Luigi discovers to his chagrin that the bosses may be setting him up to take the fall. The heart of the story is the relationship between Rosario, who is devoutly religious and so private that he seems locked inside himself, and Luigi's spoiled, angry son. Rosario's extreme austerity and self-discipline inspire Matteo to sneer and lash out at his father's luxurious way of life. And in the film's most dramatic scene, one New Year's Eve he goes on a rampage of destruction in his father's home. That rampage was preceded by other acts of theft and vandalism. But Luigi, as naïve about his son as he is about his business colleagues, has wrongly assumed Rosario to be the guilty party. This moody, well-acted film, which New Directors/New Films is showing tonight at 6 and tomorrow night at 9 at the Museum of Modern Art, stirs up many psychological crosscurrents. But its tendency to wander from theme to theme diffuses its emotional impact. The movie doesn't devote nearly enough screen time to the relationship between the teenagers, and the tentative scenes between Luigi and his mistress might as well belong to another movie. The movie's emotional center of gravity isn't Luigi but the enigmatic, poker-faced Rosario, whose ferocious pride and sense of honor set him apart from everyone else. He remains an alien in their midst as well as a mystery to the viewer. Laurence Attali's short film, ''Baobab,'' which opens the program, is a witty mythical examination of the baobab tree, the national symbol of Senegal. In addition to having many practical uses, these twisting, gnarly trees are invested with centuries of folklore and are thought by many to house spirits that can work practical magic. The movie humorously cautions against investing the baobab with too many magical properties. I PREFER THE SOUND OF THE SEADirected by Mimmo Calopresti; written (in Italian, with English subtitles) by Mr. Calopresti and Francesco Bruni; director of photography, Luca Bigazzi; edited by Massimo Fiocchi; music by Franco Piersanti; art director, Allessandro Marrazzo; produced by Donatella Botti, Roberto Cicutto and Luigi Musini.

FILM REVIEW; An Anthology of Funny Moments in Other Movies - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from January 12, 2001, Section E, Page 19Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. There probably aren't many movies as ruthless in sacrificing their own narrative logic to get a laugh as ''Double Take,'' a shell game passing as entertainment. The movie also steals chunks from so many other pictures that it's like watching the surveillance tapes of shoplifters at a Seven-11. One scene is lifted right out of ''Silver Streak,'' in which Richard Pryor teaches the haplessly vanilla Gene Wilder to be black so he can elude the police. This time, the street hustler Freddy Tiffany (Eddie Griffin) gives lessons to Daryl Chase (Orlando Jones), an investment banker on the run from the law. The problem is that in previous scenes, Daryl has shown no need to find his inner homeboy. He's as down as Freddie, and some of their insult exchanges rival an old-school shootout between East Coast and West Coast rappers; at one point, Daryl calls Freddie ''a little leprechaun pimp.''The ''Double'' trouble begins when Daryl is implicated in an illegal funds transfer and worsens when he is implicated in the murders of several policemen and a co-worker. Sort of framed for crimes he's unclear about, he has to go to Mexico to meet with a C. I. A. operative and clear his name. At Penn Station, he runs into the always underfoot Freddy, and they swap identities -- or at least clothes -- to make the trip. Most of ''Double Take'' is lifted from ''The In-Laws.'' Freddy tells Daryl that he's really an F. B. I. agent. This seems like a particularly outrageous claim from a man whom Daryl has already caught trying to run con games and who, it turns out, is wanted by the Mexican authorities for murdering a governor, which makes it difficult for Daryl to slip into Mexico. (Or what looks like the part of Venice, Calif., that was also used to pass for Mexico in the beginning of ''Touch of Evil.'')One of the few things ''Double Take'' has going for it is Mr. Jones's take on Daryl; he plays Daryl as a black man comfortable with who he is, and doesn't condescend to what passes for his character. Daryl is not the stereotype of African-American WASP manque that so many comedians perceive well-educated black men to be (as if, subconsciously, they're agreeing with the tired old dictum that educated blacks can no longer be real). This isn't ''Strictly Business,'' and Mr. Jones gets to one-up the motormouth Mr. Griffin without breaking his stride. But Mr. Jones's assurance -- he even lets traces of his Alabama accent slip in -- disappear as ''Double Take'' hops from one movie reference to the next. Mr. Griffin and Mr. Jones get some friction going early on, when their parts are more clearly delineated, and both actors probably improvised a good deal of their dialogue. But when things get sketchy, their parts seem interchangeable; Mr. Griffin could be playing Daryl and Mr. Jones could be Freddy. So by the time they do switch identities so Daryl can slip out of Manhattan, the laughs just seem cheap. It does help that Mr. Griffin has a comic persona; he's always the guy who talks too much on the sitcom ''Malcolm and Eddie'' or in his stand-up routines. The picture itself becomes indistinct: it's a generic action picture involving the vaguely racist cliche of Mexican drug cartel money (someone must have decided it was time to give the Colombians a break), with explosions and shootouts in large, handsome spaces. (The soigne production design is by the capable Stephen Lineweaver.) George Gallo, the writer and director, seems to be using the sprint-for-your-life mismatched-buddy paradigm he first employed on ''Midnight Run,'' which he also wrote. If ''Double Take'' sounds reminiscent of Brett Ratner comedies like ''Money Talks'' and ''Rush Hour,'' its similarities caught Mr. Ratner's eye as well; he is one of this film's producers. Possibly the most fascinating thing about ''Double Take'' is that Mr. Ratner has probably outgrown this kind of film by now, and despite a few laughs provided by the game and the intense performers, most of the audience probably has, too. That may be the reason some of Mr. Griffin's dialogue sounds as if it was overdubbed into something more PG-13-friendly. That audience segment isn't old enough to have seen most of the movies ''Double Take'' is photocopying.''Double Take'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence, strong language and mild sexual content.

FILM REVIEW; Souls Lost and Found Connected by a Newborn - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from February 25, 2000, Section E, Page 33Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.''We are not called upon to do great tasks, but everyday tasks,'' Mother Superior (Sonia Gessner) tells her young nuns in her even, unruffled tone. In ''Not of This World,'' it is sometimes a great task to get through the everyday. Everyone in this loamy soap opera seems slightly depressed -- even Sister Caterina (Margherita Buy), the focus of most of the film. She is roused from her commitment to God and the church when a jogger (Stefano Abbati) stops long enough to light up a smoke and hand her a newborn boy that he found on his run. The director, Giuseppe Piccioni, shows an eye for small details, grace notes that can give a scene a memorable touch. When it comes to fashioning a larger context, though, he is more interested in pouring on an old-world melancholy. Mr. Piccioni's film wants to ruminate on faith and family as well as dance with ambiguity. Most of the characters are estranged from conventional families and try to create familial bonds outside the boundaries of home. When Sister Caterina tries to explain why she decides to move out of her mother's home -- ''I've made a choice to be near God,'' she explains -- her mother (Giuliana Lojodice) snorts, ''There's always something more important than your mother.''Sister Caterina is a little older than the other novices. Her path to the convent probably was not as clear-cut as it was for the younger women; it has taken her a while to get there. The cost of spiritually tithing herself to her faith can be seen in her face. And that faith is shaken as she gets closer to the infant. She visits him every day in the hospital, and her remote mask softens each time she lays eyes on the baby. Another participant in the film's minor mystery concerning the baby's paternity is Ernesto (Silvio Orlando), the owner of a laundry and dry cleaner, a doughy sad sack so enraptured of depression that he can't even remember the names of the bright-eyed young women who work for him. He treats them all very well, but he pines for something. Ernesto may be the father of the little boy, whose young mother, Teresa (Carolina Freschi), yearns for completion like Ernesto. Mr. Orlando's Ernesto looks a little like the British comic actor Peter Sellers and he wrings a bit of humor out of his lost-soul demeanor, although he is used as an object of sympathy, as is almost everything in the film. (Ernesto accuses the withholding Sister Caterina of lacking in feeling; she is the character ''not of this world.'') The movie, which opens today at the U. A. Union Square 14, is a wisp of a weeper, a talky anachronism in these days of South American novellas and Pedro Almodovar's flights of moistened heartbreak. The characters spend more time talking about their feelings than they do showing them. The handsome score, which at times mourns for the cast, and the vivacious cinematography add a little life. It all builds toward a melodrama of modest ambitions, too proud to be shameless -- perhaps not realizing that soap opera and good taste may be one of the least appealing of contrasts.

FILM REVIEW; Clowns in the Costumes of the Magi - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from December 5, 1997, Section E, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. As Christmas entertainments go, ''We Free Kings'' is a romp with a difference. Ribald, raucous and often irreverent, this Italian-French-German co-production, directed by Sergio Citti, is a meandering comic meditation on mankind and religion. Built around the wanderings of a high-minded, low-budget three-man circus troupe consisting of two clowns and a tamer, ''We Free Kings'' (''I Magi Randagi'') manages to address a political agenda; suggest both the possibilities and impossibilities of European harmony; cast a knowing eye on such sins as greed, lust and envy; offer a hilarious send-up of soap operas and hold out the chance that maybe, just maybe, people will learn to recognize a messiah when they see one. For all its underlying concern with religion, ''We Free Kings,'' playing today at the Museum of Modern Art and beginning an engagement tomorrow at Anthology Film Archives, is scarcely a film for those who brook no trifling with the seriousness of their faith. But for those with a couple of hours to spare and an open mind, the shaggy-dog story that is ''We Free Kings'' provides a few laughs and some food for thought. Mr. Citti's heroes -- played by Silvio Orlando, Rolf Zacher and Patrick Bauchau -- are a scruffy threesome, an Italian, a Frenchman and a German who represent humanity at its best and worst. When first encountered, they have roused the little village of Monte Feroce to attend their circus, which promises to expose its audience to the most ferocious of beasts. But instead of producing a lion or a tiger, the tamer introduces a rifle-toting man dressed in a German Army uniform and a Mafioso. ''Don't you realize man is the most ferocious of beasts?'' the tamer asks. The audience proves his point by running the threesome out of town. Footsore, they try to hitch a ride by stealing three camels intended for another town's Nativity pageant. They are under arrest when the three villagers who usually portray the Wise Men demand too much for their services, so the two clowns and the tamer of the Circus Fly are outfitted with the costumes of the Magi, which does not prevent them from dallying with the love-starved local women. It seems that the men of the village would rather buy cars than bring up children. No child has been born in that village for a dozen years. The Wise Men refuse to proceed without a real baby, a decision that soon finds them under a beckoning star, stowed away aboard a ship, jointly dreaming of an interview with God and finally in hopeful search of the new messiah. In ''We Free Kings,'' the Christmas spirit runs slightly amok.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. TAKING Virginia Woolf's bountiful and witty 1928 novel, ""Orlando,"" which is as much about words, writing and the dogged pursuit of fine literature as about a number of other things, Sally Potter has made a grand new movie that is as much a richly informed appreciation of the novel as it is a free adaptation. This ravishing and witty spectacle invades the mind through eyes that are dazzled without ever being anesthetized. Throughout Ms. Potter's ""Orlando,"" as in Woolf's, there are a piercing kind of common sense and a joy that, because they are so rare these days in any medium, create their own kind of cinematic suspense and delightedly surprised laughter. ""Orlando"" could well become a classic of a very special kind, not mainstream perhaps, but a model for independent film makers who follow their own irrational muses, sometimes to unmourned obscurity, occasionally to glory.""Orlando"" will begin its regular commercial run here in June but, if you're lucky enough to already have tickets, you can see it at the Roy and Niuta Titus Theater 1 in the Museum of Modern Art tonight at 6, or tomorrow at 3 P. M. ""Orlando"" (on a bill with Philip Haas's ""Music of Chance"") is the opening attraction of this year's New Directors/New Films series, sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the museum's film department. I can't remember any previous series starting off at quite such a high, madcap level. Here is a movie in which Orlando (Tilda Swinton), the hero, a beautiful young nobleman who was earlier adored by the aging Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp), goes to sleep one night in the 17th century, only to wake up five days later as the heroine. It's no great shock to Orlando. She turns to the camera (as she does from time to time throughout the film) and says tersely: ""Same person, no difference at all. Just a different sex.""Orlando, her curiosity undiminished, goes on learning about life through the centuries up into our own, at which point she is somewhere in her late 30's. In one of her last appearances, the woman (about whom Queen Elizabeth once said, according to Woolf, ""I know a man when I see one"") is shown helmeted and goggled, driving across the English landscape on a motorcycle, her small daughter bouncing happily in the sidecar. Between the reign of Elizabeth I, when she was a boy, and the 20th century, when motherhood more or less happens to her, Orlando enjoys a serene immortality doing what she chooses. She ponders the differences between men and women and, from her own privileged vantage point, discovers their similarities. She pursues a poet's career, only to be ridiculed in the 16th century, fawned upon in the 19th and asked to do rewrites in the 20th. While still a man, Orlando falls in love with the gorgeous Sasha (Charlotte Valandrey), a mysterious and wanton Moscovite princess in London at the time of the Great Frost of 1603. As a woman she falls in love with the handsome Shelmerdine (Billy Zane), an idealized American with whom she has a more enduring, if less sexually demanding, relationship. Sometimes it's not always easy to tell exactly where Orlando is in time, but then she has the same problem. Time keeps flying by even at those moments when it seems to creep for Orlando, as when she finds herself guiltily bored in an 18th-century London drawing room surrounded by Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison and other wits of the day. She darts into a fine old English maze in the 18th century and emerges a few moments later in the 19th century when Queen Victoria is in Buckingham Palace. In such ways does Ms. Potter, who wrote the screenplay and directed the film, make the same kind of breathtaking, utterly rational leaps in time and place that Woolf does in prose. She also rediscovers the timelessness and profoundly comic density of the novel that, when it was published in 1928, critics were inclined to describe as ""not one of her more serious works.""This was perhaps because ""Orlando"" was interpreted as being so much influenced by Woolf's love for the flamboyant Vita Sackville-West. Woolf's male-female Orlando was inspired by the aristocratic Sackville-West who, like Orlando, was a writer who worshipped the idea of great literary reputation while finding only fame. Yet the novel can be seen today to far outclass such gossipy and now almost totally irrelevant associations. It's a major work by a first-class literary mind and technician. The novel stands on its own. Whether or not the film does, I'm not sure. If you've read the book, it's impossible not to recall it while watching the film, either through the ways Ms. Potter recreates sequences and images from the book, or through the ways she finds equivalents and, occasionally, through the ways in which she goes off on her own recognizance. This is a movie that may well require a preset point of view. I suspect, though, that it's a movie that will prompt a lot of people to read Woolf for the first time, which can't be at all bad. Ms. Potter's achievement is in translating to film something of the breadth of Woolf's remarkable range of interests, not only in language and literature, but also in history, nature, weather, animals, the relation of the sexes and the very nature of the sexes. The book is feminist, but also much more. The movie, photographed by Aleksei Rodionov, directly and magnificently reflects Woolf's concern for the look of things, which, in prose, must be described in inexact if evocative words, and in similes and metaphors that refer to something other. The movie is a visual trip, from the opening sequences showing Orlando's first encounter with Queen Elizabeth, through his tour of duty as a dreamy British ambassador to a magical Constantinople, and through all of the later sequences in which Orlando must look at the world through the eyes of a woman. Old Queen Bess clutches the youth to her breast with gnarled hands and filthy fingernails, commanding: ""Do not fade. Do not wither. Do not grow old.""Equally vivid on the screen is thenovel's initial tour de force, the description of the Great Frost of 1603, when the Thames froze and London moved onto the ice for what amounted to an impromptu fair. It's at a grand dinner party in a tent on the ice, the waiters wearing skates, that Orlando first meets Sasha, who loves him treacherously. Orlando moves effortlessly through the ages, through countries, through fashions, from passionate bewilderment to calm enlightenment. As important to the film's success as anything else are the bewitching face, figure and screen presence of Ms. Swinton who, with her red hair, deeply set eyes and self-assured expression, looks remarkably like portraits of the young Queen Elizabeth I. She has a sweetness, gravity and intelligence about her that make the more bizarre events appear to be completely normal. Before Orlando becomes a woman, Ms. Swinton is an exceptionally pretty youth, but never an effeminate one. This could be the beginning of a major international career for the English actress. The film's gender-bending scheme is elegantly realized in Mr. Crisp's performance as the virgin queen, a stiff, arthritic old lady who can still appreciate the look of a nicely turned, youthful calf while reaching for the thigh. John Wood is very funny as the Archduke Harry, who lusts after Orlando through time, and Heathcote Williams is hilarious as a scroungy Elizabethan poet, who tells nasty tales about his better-known colleagues. Ms. Valandrey, a French actress, is missed when Sasha leaves the story. Mr. Zane (Shelmerdine) is almost as beautiful as Ms. Swinton. That sort of thing works for ""Orlando.""More than anything else, though, ""Orlando"" is Ms. Swinton's triumph. With the firmest but lightest of touches, she has spun gossamer.

The ghost of Benito Mussolini haunts ""Il Portaborse,"" a satirical comedy about the ascent of a crypto-Fascist Italian politician with a telegenic face and the conscience of a sewer rat. The rise of this fascinating monster, Cesare Botero (played by Nanni Moretti), is followed through the eyes of Luciano Sandulli (Silvio Orlando), an Italian literature teacher and professional ghostwriter who is sucked into Botero's inner circle. Money is the lure. Even with the extra money earned from ghostwriting novels and political columns, Luciano still can't afford repairs on a grand country home whose ceiling rains plaster on his head while he works. One day Luciano is visited by representatives of Botero, Italy's high-powered Minister of Finance. Whisked to their boss's inner sanctum, Luciano is pressed into accepting a job as a speechwriter for the minister's embattled re-election campaign. Botero, who cultivates an image of a progressive-minded smoothie with a picture-perfect family, is a different character behind the scenes. A control freak with an explosive temper, he tyrannizes his staff and encourages his henchmen to rough up demonstrators who would mar his public appearances. Luciano also discovers that Botero is thoroughly corrupt. The minister, who portrays himself as a forward-looking civil servant, in private ridicules modern politics as ""grotesque"" and arrogantly compares himself to a feudal baron. As Botero's pet, Luciano becomes the recipient of favors. A new sports car appears in his driveway, his house is fixed up, and his fiancee, Irene (Angela Finocchiaro), suddenly lands a better teaching job. Juliette (Anne Roussel), a beautiful assistant to the minister, makes it clear to Luciano that she is also available for him. If ""Il Portaborse,"" which opened today at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, is an ominous political fable, the tone is almost perversely lighthearted. And the film, a French-Italian production directed by Daniele Luchetti, lacks any of the thriller elements that would be de rigueur in a Hollywood movie about political corruption. Even in its darkest moments, ""Il Portaborse"" never loses its attitude of cheery cynicism. It goes so far as to suggest that in Italy it is fairly easy to carry off a gigantic voting fraud, whether through paper ballots or computers. Because the film, which created a minor storm when it was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, seems to allude to contemporary figures in Italian politics, American audiences will feel a sense of dislocation. It also doesn't help that the movie lacks even a rudimentary explanation of the Italian political system.""Il Portaborse"" is quite well acted. Mr. Orlando's Luciano is a blank, faintly comic figure whose one pathetic gesture of nobility is to try to secure a pension from Botero for an impoverished but distinguished poet he reveres. But the film really belongs to Mr. Moretti, whose portrait of a power-hungry megalomaniac is notable for the way it captures the chameleonlike temperament of someone who can transform himself from a thundercloud into a font of sweetness and charm in the blink of an eye. Il PortaborseDirected by Daniele Luchetti; written by Sandro Petraglia, Stefano Rulli and Mr. Luchetti, (in Italian with English subtitles), based on a story by Franco Bernini and Angelo Pasquini; director of photography, Alessandro Pesci; edited by Mirco Garrone; music by Dario Lucantoni; production designers, Giancarlo Basili and Leonardo Scarpa; released by Titanus Distribution.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.''Palombella Rossa'' (''Red Wood Pigeon'') introduces American audiences to Nanni Moretti, reported to be one of Italy's wittiest social satirists as well as a triple-threat movie maker. The film is to be shown at the Museum of Modern Art today at 6 P. M. and tomorrow at 9 P. M. as part of the New Directors/New Films series. Mr. Moretti is an engaging screen personality. He looks a little like Giancarlo Giannini, with large sad eyes set in a handsome face that expresses more intelligence than the character is allowed to acknowledge. He is the Italian cinema's idealized Everyman, with comic, earnest bewilderment the tone of his performance. In ''Palombella Rossa,'' which he also wrote and directed, Mr. Moretti appears as Michele, a middle-aged Communist trying to keep his bearings in a world where old dogmas are dying with disorienting speed. It's a losing battle. Michele is having the sort of emotional breakdown that in older, more innocent days was assumed to be a prerogative of the decadent bourgeoisie. Now everybody has them, along with color television, an automobile and a frost-free fridge. Michele's specific panics aren't always comprehensible to the non-Italian viewer, but his dreamlike muddles are. When first seen, Michele is driving alone, amusing himself by making grotesque faces at the little girl riding in the back seat of the car ahead of him. One thing leads to another and Michele crashes noisily if harmlessly into another car. In the way of dreams, the scene arbitrarily shifts. Michele finds himself conscripted (by old friends he doesn't recognize) into playing against Hungary in an international match, the exact nature of which he doesn't know. It turns out to be water polo, a game at which he excelled as a young man. Now he can't remember the plays. Most of the film takes place in and around the pool during the game. Michele is assaulted by memories and hallucinations that are not easily separated. There are references to something that happened last Tuesday and the election coming up tomorrow. A pushy interviewer asks him what it means to be a Communist. Someone else accuses him of thinking of himself instead of about the masses, which is usually the case when someone is in the middle of an epic anxiety attack. When he appears on a television panel show, some people applaud though he answers a question in purest gibberish. Language has lost its meaning. There's a recurring gag involving David Lean's film version of ''Dr. Zhivago,'' which Michele watches from time to time on a television set in the pool-side bar. The other players who join him are able to recite all of the sappy dialogue along with Omar Sharif, and they weep as poor Zhivago loses Lara in the final sequence.''Palombella Rossa'' has a brilliantly sunny look that accents Michele's confusions. He can see everything, yet, as in a nightmare, nothing makes sense. Giuseppe Lanci's photography is full of slashes of color so bold that the objects themselves become secondary. The pool has the stylized clarity of something in a David Hockney painting. It's anybody's guess whether or not this anxiety attack has an end. ''Palombella Rossa,'' however, is often a lark while it's going on, and Mr. Moretti a most persuasive victim.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. For a film maker who thrives on taking chances, ""Philadelphia"" sounds like the biggest gamble of all. As the first high-profile Hollywood film to take the AIDS plague seriously, Jonathan Demme's latest work has stubborn preconceptions to overcome as well as enormous potential to make waves. What it does not have, despite the fine acting and immense decency that give it substance, is much evidence of Mr. Demme's usual daring. Maybe that's not surprising: it isn't easy to leave fingerprints when you're wearing kid gloves. Hollywood's past reluctance to take on AIDS isn't strictly a matter of cowardice. This subject, with all its anguished inevitability, does not easily lend itself to run-of-the-mill movie methods. If the theater has led the way, with works as different as ""Jeffrey"" and ""Angels in America,"" it also has more freedom to experiment with format. Conventional wisdom has it that a big-budget film needs reassuring familiarity if it means to play at the multiplex, even if Mr. Demme proved otherwise with his bracingly tough ""Silence of the Lambs.""If the dread-disease drama has often been relegated to television, there, too, AIDS has proved daunting: HBO's attention-getting ""And the Band Played On"" was a much more tepid undertaking than ""Philadelphia"" turns out to be. Unlike that obviously hamstrung dramatization, ""Philadelphia"" mostly succeeds in being forceful, impassioned and moving, sometimes even rising to the full range of emotion that its subject warrants. But too often, even at its most assertive, it works in safely predictable ways.""Philadelphia,"" which has the year's most elegant and apt movie title, begins with great promise and with a reminder of what the unfettered Mr. Demme can do. A stirring montage of Philadelphia street life, accompanied by a mournfully beautiful new Bruce Springsteen song, offers a resounding sense of vitality and communal obligation. (The film is suffused with haunting music, with operatic arias used much too pointedly in several places and Neil Young's title song floating gently through its final scene.) Mr. Demme knows how to breathe both hope and frustration into the promise of brotherly love. Soon afterward, Mr. Demme shows an equally impressive tact as he introduces Andrew Beckett, the lawyer played by Tom Hanks. First seen defending a construction company accused of spreading pestilent dust, Andrew is next shown visiting a clinic for AIDS treatment. The film attaches no fanfare to this information, and it spares the audience a melodramatic scene in which Andrew's AIDS is first diagnosed. Likewise, it presents his mother (Joanne Woodward) as determinedly brave and well aware of her son's situation. With these touches, the film promises not to exploit its subject in maudlin ways, and that is a promise it keeps. Mr. Demme and his screenwriter, Ron Nyswaner, elect to dramatize their material by presenting AIDS as a cause as well as a personal calamity. So ""Philadelphia"" gives Andrew a tangible grievance. First, he is established as an ambitious, gung-ho young corporate lawyer. ""Outstanding!"" exclaims Andrew, upon hearing that the firm has landed an important account. Next, he is seen arousing suspicion among the firm's equally hearty senior partners. ""What's that on your forehead, pal?"" one of them asks, staring at a Kaposi's sarcoma lesion.""Oh, that!"" says Andrew, with the forced heartiness that hides his real nature, and as such is the habit of a lifetime. ""I got whacked in the head with a racquetball."" Nobody believes him. When Andrew is summarily fired on a trumped-up charge of incompetence, the film gives him a mission: to sue his former firm for wrongful termination and to fight the bigotry faced by people with AIDS. Admirable as this is in the abstract, it steers the movie in exactly the wrong direction. ""Philadelphia"" winds up centered on the courtroom, devoting an inordinate amount of time to what should only have been this story's MacGuffin, a minor but galvanizing plot device. The courtroom scenes, which lack suspense and too often have a soapbox tenor, will not tell the audience anything it doesn't already know. A much more interesting side of ""Philadelphia"" depicts the relationship between Andrew and Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), his anti-gay, ambulance-chasing lawyer. (""We take no cash unless we get cash justice for you,"" Joe informs one potential client.) Reluctant to take Andrew's case at first, and flaunting his fears and prejudices with his doctor and his wife, Joe changes gratifyingly during the course of the story. Mr. Hanks gives a brave, stirring, tremendously dignified performance as a man slowly wasting away. But Mr. Washington, who is also very fine as the small-minded shyster who becomes a crusading hero, has the better role. It shouldn't have been that way. But Mr. Nyswaner's screenplay allows Andrew almost nothing in the way of individual characteristics. It makes him a gay Everyman whose love of opera -- awkwardly underscored in a scene that shows the audience how little it really knows about Andrew -- hardly qualifies as a distinctive trait. Andrew's domestic relationship with Miguel (Antonio Banderas) is presented so sketchily that it barely seems real. The screenplay's tendency to evade and overgeneralize is not helped by the depiction of gay men as gentle souls, straight men as bigots, and Andrew's large family as a monolithic, enlightened entity. Andrew's father: ""We're incredibly proud of you."" Andrew's mother: ""You get in there and you fight for your rights."" Andrew: ""Gee, I love you guys.""Most of ""Philadelphia"" is a lot better than that. Neither Mr. Demme's attention to detail nor his talent for tight, urgent storytelling has let him down. He has assembled a large, expertly cast group of actors to fill out the film's background, among them Ron Vawter as the law firm's one conscience-stricken partner, Jason Robards as its overbearing patriarch, Anna Deavere Smith as an astute paralegal and Robert Castle (the priest who is Mr. Demme's cousin, and the subject of his ""Cousin Bobby"") as Andrew's father. Ms. Woodward is especially memorable in a brief but luminous appearance. And Mary Steenburgen has the potentially interesting role of a ruthless, sarcastic defense attorney determined to wear down a now-frail Andrew when he gets to the courtroom. But even here, the film pulls its punches. After conducting a particularly grueling cross-examination, Ms. Steenburgen is allowed to acquit herself by muttering ""I hate this case!""""Philadelphia"" may be equivocal in its attitudes, but Mr. Demme will never make a film that lacks visual color. Tak Fujimoto, Craig McKay and Kristi Zea, who have collaborated with the director before as cinematographer, editor and production designer, respectively, give the film a warm, believable look and a vigorous pace. Mention should also be made of Carl Fullerton's makeup, which makes sure that Mr. Hanks's transformation from robust lawyer to visibly suffering AIDS patient will not soon be forgotten. In the end, thanks to such effects and to the simple grace of Mr. Hanks's performance, this film does accomplish what it means to. ""Philadelphia"" rises above its flaws to convey the full urgency of its difficult subject, and to bring that subject home.""Philadelphia"" is rated PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned).

What would America be like today if Germany had won World War II by dropping a bomb on Washington? Much of ""Philadelphia Experiment 2"" is devoted to imagining that alternative, but with a paucity of wit that is mind-numbing, given the possibilities. Instead of a sun-drenched suburban landscape, Southern California is a sprawling, heavily policed labor camp called Freedom City, which looks like an endless oil refinery. Loudspeakers posted everywhere incessantly play a children's chorus intoning slogans like ""propagate, educate, suplicate,"" which are also flashed on movie screens. (The repeated misspelling of supplicate seems unintentional.) There is not a swastika in sight. In a plot that suggests a particularly desperate episode of ""Star Trek,"" David Herdeg (Brad Johnson), a scientific guinea pig, finds himself propelled into this nightmare world. His adversary, Col. William Mailer (Gerrit Graham), is the mad scientist who invented the machine that lands him there. To right history's course, David has to zoom back to 1943 to prevent the Germans from deploying the deadly bomber. In the penny-pinching world of ""Philadelphia Experiment 2,"" this is accomplished by igniting some fuel oil.""Philadelphia Experiment 2,"" which was directed by Stephen Cornwell from a script by Kevin Rock and Nick Paine, is not helped by a mumbling, stone-faced performance from Mr. Johnson. In the best tradition of grade-C science fiction, the movie, which is strongly anti-science, is regularly peppered with pronouncements like, ""Man was not meant to play with time.""""Philadelphia Experiment 2"" has been rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

IN view of the fact that its heroestravel from 1943 to the presentand perhaps back again, it's remarkable that ''The Philadelphia Experiment'' contains so few surprises. It's a pleasant but fairly standard movie about a subject that's anything but. Stewart Raffill, who directed ''The Adventures of the Wilderness Family,'' seems to be in over his head with the high-tech aspects of his story. But at least he's able to keep it moving.''The Philadelphia Experiment,'' which has some pretensions as ''science-fact,'' is about tests that took place in and around the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1943 in an attempt to develop a means of rendering Navy ships invisible to enemy radar. The results of the project are, as the phrase goes, shrouded in secrecy, and so the movie picks up where the facts leave off. It follows two young seamen named David (Michael Pare) and Jim (Bobby Di Cicco) through some fake-looking lightning effects, and then into a strange land filled with new inventions. When they wander into a bar and discover video games and pop-top soda cans, David and Jim realize just how seriously the project has gone wrong. The movie, which opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters, doesn't make much of the possibilities this situation raises. David and Jim's perceptions of 1984 don't seem fresh or startling (although David does see President Reagan at a televised news conference and mutter, ''I know this guy! Is this another movie?''). And the film doesn't make more than a passing effort to see what will happen when they encounter friends and relatives who have aged by 41 years. Instead, it throws David together with the friendly, helpful Allison (Nancy Allen), and along comes the predictable romance. Nothing looks good in ''The Philadephia Experiment,'' not even the handsome Mr. Pare. He doesn't sound good, either, speaking with a deep, nasal mumble in heavy Brooklynese. Miss Allen has a sweet, easygoing quality that's helpful, but she doesn't have much of a role. Mr. Di Cicco is very affable and outgoing, but he isn't around for long. And Louise Latham makes a brief but effective appearance as a 60-ish version of a character we've seen earlier; hers might easily have been the movie's most implausible role.''The Philadelphia Experiment'' is rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''). It contains a small amount of violence and strong language.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""THE YOUNG PHILADELPHIANS,"" which took up residence at the Criterion yesterday, repeatedly generates the rather disturbing thought that the rich, genteel burghers of Ritten-house Square are equally at home in soap opera. The Main Line, this sudsy Warner Brothers drama keeps stressing, is as full of skeleton-lined closets as those in improvident South-Side Philadelphia households. Deeply underlined, too, is the fact that the striving for high caste and success will even turn the head of a well brought-up young man in love. Although ""The Young Philadephians"" appears to be striving mightily to say something trenchant it only makes a surface social commentary. The script James Gunn has developed from the novel ""The Philadelphian"" by Richard Powell, is full of sound and some fury including sex, murder, drunkenness and double-dealing, which point up the picture of a city without much brotherly love. As a battler against the jealousies and rigid social barriers of the Main Line, Paul Newman personifies most of the challenge in an all-too-frequently pallid drama. Mr. Newman, it appears, is talked out of a quick marriage to a social young lady by her suave lawyer-father. In calculated reprisal, he sets his sights on success in the silken Machiavellian style of the Philadelphia upper crust. Although he is well on his way as a tax expert in a flossy law firm, the fruits of achievements are tasteless until he is forced into defending his friend. The friend, now turned into a wastrel and alcoholic through the machinations of his rich relatives, is charged with the murder of his uncle. At this point, our harried hero, discreetly threatened by a whole slew of Main Liners, learns that his fine good name only masks his illegitimacy. Undaunted, however, he proceeds to do the honorable thing and, strangely enough, brotherly love finally does reign supreme. But these are only the bare bones of an over-lengthy story bristling with some digressive sub-plots, only a few of which have much impact. Paul Newman as well as most of the principals add little that is unusual or especially forceful to these proceedings, which could have been given special emphasis but instead appear overly familiar. While a viewer can appreciate Mr. Newman's willingness to endanger his position and that of his mother in a climactic resolve to see justice done, he rarely enlivens the role with the animation of a man moved by a momentous decision. Although he is effective on occasion, he seems to be carrying restraint a mite too far. As the pretty and sensible girl he first loses and eventually wins, Barabra Rush has one good love scene and contributes a proper air of frustration. Robert Vaughn, as Newman's sick and illused friend, adds a striking bit in incoherently explaining his dire predicament. Billie Burke, as a slightly addlepated multimillionaire, lends a cute touch to the somber goings-on, and Alexis Smith is momentarily effective in a brief role as lovelorn wife of an aging lawyer. Diane Brewster, as Mr. Newman's mother, and Brian Keith, as the self-made Irish contractor who sired him, make the most of overdrawn characters. They, as well as John Williams, Otto Kruger, Frank Conroy and Robert Douglas, representing other wealthy Main Liners, are adequate in support of the principals. In ""The Young Philadelphians"" they prove that the trials and tribulations of the rich, like those of the poor, can be undramatic.

THE SCREEN; A Splendid Cast Adorns the Screen Version of 'The Philadelphia Story' at the Music Hall - The New York Times,"a witty, romantic script derived by Donald Ogden Stewart out of Philip Barry's successful play; the flavor of high-society elegance, in which the patrons invariably luxuriate, and a splendid cast of performers headed by Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. If it doesn't play out this year and well along into next they should turn the Music Hall into a shooting gallery. It has been a long time since Hollywood has spent itself so extravagantly, and to such entertaining effect, upon a straight upper-crust fable, an unblushing apologia for plutocracy. Money and talent are mostly going these days into elaborate outdoor epics and rugged individualist films. It is like old times to see one about the trials and tribulations of the rich, and to have Miss Hepburn back, after a two-year recess, as another spoiled and willful daughter of America's unofficial peerage, comporting herself easily amid swimming pools, stables and the usual appurtenances of a huge estate. For that is what she is—and does—in the Messrs. Stewart's and Barry's pleasant dissertation upon a largely inconsequential subject, that subject being the redemption of a rather priggish and disagreeable miss. The writers have solemnly made her out as a frigid and demanding sort of person—one of ""a special class of American females: the married maidens""—who has divorced her first husband and is preparing to take unto herself another simply because she doesn't understand her own psyche. But an amusing complication, whereby an ink-smeared journalist and a girl photographer turn up to ""cover"" her wedding for a ""snoop"" magazine leads to a strange exposure of her basic hypocrisy, and she remarries the proper man to the proper effect. Truthfully, the psychology of the story is as specious as a spiel, and, for all the talk about the little lady being ""a sort of high priestess to a virgin goddess,"" etc., she is and remains at the end what most folks would call a plain snob. But the way Miss Hepburn plays her, with the wry things she is given to say, she is an altogether charming character to meet cinematically. Some one was rudely charging a few years ago that Miss Hepburn was ""box-office poison."" If she is, a lot of people don't read labels—including us. But she isn't the only one who gives a brilliant performance in this film. James Stewart, as the acid word-slinger, matches her poke for gibe all the way and incidentally contributes one of the most cozy drunk scenes with Miss Hepburn we've ever seen. Gary Grant, too, is warmly congenial as the castof but undefeated mate, and Ruth Hussey, Virginia Weidler, Roland Young and Mary Nash add much to the merriment. Provided you have a little patience for the lavishly rich, which these folk are, you should have great fun at ""The Philadelphia Story."" For Metro and Director George Cukor have graciously made it apparent, in the words of a character, that one of ""the prettiest sights in this pretty world is the privileged classes enjoying their privileges."" And so, in this instance, will you, too. THE PHILADELPHIA STORY; screen play by Donald Ogden Stewart; based on the play by Philip Barry; directed by George Cukor; produced by Joseph L.

Review/Film: Poetic Justice; On the Road To Redemption - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from July 23, 1993, Section C, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. FROM time to time throughout ""Poetic Justice,"" John Singleton's new romantic melodrama, a pretty, button-nosed South-Central Los Angeles beautician named Justice, played by the pop superstar Janet Jackson, muses about life and loneliness on the soundtrack. It might be better if she sang the words accompanied by a loud backup group, so we couldn't hear them. Instead, Justice speaks the words clearly, with the fearful reverence of a child ordered to commit Portia's ""quality of mercy"" speech to memory overnight. Not only the individual words are comprehensible, but also enough of their meanings so that we are aware of the singular disparity between the speaker and her musings. Although these are supposed to be poems dashed off by Justice to ease her pain, they are, in fact, the work of the celebrated Maya Angelou, poet and earth mother. Ms. Angelou's poems, long-views of the human condition with rolling cadences and melancholy codas, seem no less foreign to Justice than Shakespeare's language. The Angelou poems buzz around Justice's head like a swarm of benign bees on a hot summer day. They neither sting nor provoke. They just happen to be in the neighborhood.""Poetic Justice"" is a mess, but it's an adventurous one. It's a movie whose unrealized ambitions are in many ways more interesting than the goals achieved by the success of Mr. Singleton's first film, which endeared him to the Hollywood establishment. He hit the box-office jackpot in 1991 with ""Boyz N the Hood,"" which also won him Oscar nominations as best director and best writer. As a follow-up to that comparatively conventional melodrama about growing up black and disadvantaged in South-Central, Mr. Singleton is now making a serious effort to do something different. ""Poetic Justice"" is nothing less than an attempt to celebrate the creative impulse as a means of salvation, not only for the individual but also for society. At least, that seems to be the point of the fuzzy new movie, which, in common with so many other second films, has neither the coherence nor the spontaneity of the film that preceded it. It has the air of something awkwardly fabricated to reach an inspirational goal. Nothing in the character of Justice, as written by Mr. Singleton or as passively played by Ms. Jackson, remotely suggests that she's the repository of the ideas and emotions attributed to her by Ms. Angelou's poetry. True, in the pre-credit sequence that opens the film, she is the horrified witness when her boyfriend's head is blown away by a rival gang at a drive-in theater. Yet Justice seems more dim than despairing. At best, her sadness appears to be entirely self-addressed. She lives alone in South-Central in a big, roomy, well-furnished middle-class house, left to her by her grandmother. When someone asks about her name, she says her mother (who apparently died a junkie) named her Justice because she became pregnant with Justice in law school. No further mention is made of either her mother or law school. Justice is popular with her colleagues at the beauty shop, but after her sorrow at the drive-in, she doesn't date. She dresses immaculately and with her own chic. She looks terrific in corn rows and wearing a sort of poor-boy cap. Yet she's a large empty space at the center of the movie. Far more believable and involving are the people around her: Lucky (Tupac Shakur), the spirited young postman who falls in love with Justice; Iesha (Regina King), her good-hearted best friend, who drinks too much and loves too easily, and Chicago (Joe Torry), Iesha's short-tempered boyfriend, who works with Lucky at the post office. Most of ""Poetic Justice"" is a road movie. Iesha persuades Justice to go on a blind date. The two women accompany Chicago and Lucky as they drive a load of mail from Los Angeles to Oakland, Calif. As Iesha and Chicago drink and make love in the back of the truck, Justice shares the cab with Lucky. It turns out that Justice has met Lucky before and doesn't like him. Instead of talking, she sits in her corner writing poems. He: ""What do you write about."" She: ""Whatever's in my heart."" He: ""What's that?"" She: ""I don't know."" In that way they begin to connect. En route they make unscheduled stops at a beach and a fair. In the film's most engaging sequence, they crash a huge barbecue billed as ""The Johnson Family Reunion."" There Justice has a brief encounter with a most patrician-looking Ms. Angelou, playing Aunt June. As with most of their other stops, this one ends in some bitterness: Iesha flirts with the wrong man, and a fight breaks out.""Poetic Justice"" is not strong on narrative and not very clear about what narrative there is. Although its aspirations are high, the film works only fitfully when Mr. Singleton exercises his gift for vernacular speech, for finding the comic undertow in otherwise tragic situations, and even for parody. The last is apparent in a brief glimpse of the film Justice and her boyfriend are watching at the beginning of ""Poetic Justice."" It's something called ""Deadly Diva,"" in which two super-smooth black stars act out a fantasy that's as far removed from life in South-Central Los Angeles as Iceland.""Poetic Justice"" has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a lot of vulgar language and several scenes of violence and sexual action.

FILM REVIEW; Radio-Station Intrigue In a Lucas Creation - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from October 21, 1994, Section C, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Some movies are so big and so bad that they're funny, like ""The Specialist."" Others are bad in a grim and boring way, like ""Radioland Murders."" Even George Lucas makes mistakes, and ""Radioland Murders"" is one of his whoppers. Mr. Lucas, the ""Star Wars"" genius, created the story and served as executive producer and technical czar on the film, which is set in 1939 on the night a radio station is going national. Penny (Mary Stuart Masterson) is the efficient secretary who keeps everything running. She has decided to divorce her husband, Roger (Brian Benben), one of the show's writers. He claims he was framed when Penny caught him in the sexy singer's dressing room. And as the station's employees are murdered one by one, it seems that Roger is being framed for that, too. In one night he has to solve the murders, save his marriage and finish writing a show that's already on the air. The film tries to pay homage to its period by reproducing a radio show and echoing the snappy dialogue, savvy romance and frenetic pace of 30's comedies, adding suspense along the way. But that germ of an idea is the only part that works. Much of the blame belongs to an excruciatingly unclever script, with no feel for the period. It is credited to Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz (who at their best wrote ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" from Mr. Lucas's story, but also created the fiasco ""Howard the Duck"") and Jeff Reno and Ron Osborn. The dialogue is flat. Penny sarcastically calls the star's attempted seduction of Roger ""assault with a friendly weapon."" The radio-show parodies are lame, as in a soap opera called ""Home Is Where the Heart Aches."" A hundred characters are sent scurrying around: chorus girls, an orchestra, a roomful of writers. Yet the pace is busy without being chaotically frenzied and funny, a real disappointment since the director, Mel Smith, made the frenetically funny film ""The Tall Guy.""And the mystery palls quickly. The murders are mundane. Someone is electrocuted, someone falls down an elevator shaft, and even death by laughing gas fails to make the sure-fire technique of contagious laughter work. The music is presented in such quick snips that the soundtrack creates a dinning headache, as if someone were compulsively switching stations. The biggest waste is to bring Rosemary Clooney on stage, then let her performance of ""That Old Feeling"" trail off to become a faint background sound as Roger in a penguin suit finds Penny on the building's roof. Mr. Benben (of the HBO series ""Dream On"") tries hard and gives a strenuously grinning performance; in disguise he does make a good Carmen Miranda. Otherwise, only Anita Morris, as the vampy singer, and Scott Michael Campbell, as the page who becomes Roger's sidekick, have the right shade of goofy exaggeration the material calls for. What's left? Computers. The production notes for ""Radioland Murders"" are inordinately proud of the way the film relied on up-to-the-minute technology, generating walls instead of building them and sometimes combining two characters in one scene though their parts were filmed separately. Amazingly, none of those seams show on screen. But who knows how much that technique accounts for the film's bloodless quality? This whole by-the-numbers movie might have been made by computer, after the humans signed off. As the ever-efficient Penny says to her chief engineer, ""This is a nightmare, Max.""""Radioland Murders"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). In addition to the innocuously filmed deaths, it includes some strong language and a glimpse of a bare-breasted chorus girl.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Cyril Collard can be seen in his own film ""Savage Nights"" as a warm, attractive actor with a rueful grin that never quite fades away. Mr. Collard's vivid presence in the film makes it especially sad to note that he died of AIDS on March 5, less than a week before ""Savage Nights"" received four French Cesar awards, including the one for best picture. Under happier circumstances, the appearance of ""Savage Nights"" in the New Directors/New Films series (at 9 P. M. today and tomorrow) would be an occasion to hail an impressive new talent. Mr. Collard appears in this autobiographical story as Jean, a charmingly flirtatious 30-year-old with an especially complicated sex life. Ever receptive to both men and women, he becomes involved simultaneously with Laura (Romane Bohringer), a feisty and voluptuous teen-ager, and Samy (Carlos Lopez), a handsome rugby player who is living with a woman when Jean first meets him. The frustrations brought on by these two affairs are sometimes more than Jean can manage. When that happens he goes cruising, finding release and comfort in wordless group sex with strangers. Early in the film, Jean also discovers that he is HIV positive. ""Lose your grip,"" exhorts Maria Schneider in a solemn, unspecified role. ""Drop your illusions. Learn from your disease."" In Mr. Collard's turbulent account of Jean's progress, such peaceful acceptance does not come easily. Jean spends much of the film ricocheting urgently from one blind coupling to another, trying to make sense of his situation. The film's biggest success is in moving beyond the potential myopia of such material to create a broader portrait of troubled, aimless youth. Late in the film, a car crash occurs suddenly, with neither warning nor aftermath. Mr. Collard put together ""Savage Nights"" in an abrupt, tumultuous spirit that truly reduces the car crash to nothing special. All of the events seen here, even those presented casually, become as furious and arbitrary as that accident once they are glimpsed in the light of Jean's growing desperation. The film begins with apparent nonchalance but eventually reaches an effectively frantic pitch. Mr. Collard's direction emphasizes the rawness of his story by discarding the connective tissue that might ordinarily hold it together. He never bothers to explain how Jean has gotten to Laura, then to Samy, then to Laura again or to someone else entirely. He simply juxtaposes these meetings without fanfare, thus offering some idea of how they may overlap in Jean's life. There are times when this stylistic affectation raises more questions than it answers, but most often the film maker's kaleidoscopic approach is as involving as it's meant to be. Throughout ""Savage Nights"" there are distress signals, not all of them from Jean. Samy seems to be developing a taste for sadomasochism and some sympathy for the neo-Nazi types who appear briefly in the story. Samy's girlfriend angrily berates Jean. Laura is made uncontrollably furious by Jean's admission that he had unsafe sex with her after knowing he was HIV positive. Laura's mother is equally livid, and Jean is happy to bait her. Such moments are interspersed with more sentimental episodes, as when Jean buys Laura a puppy. At one point Laura erupts at the owner of the dress shop where she works, stealing a jacket and spitting at her boss. ""I think I'll go to film school,"" Laura muses, right after this incident. Mr. Collard's wry sense of humor extends to the stereotypically rebellious posturing that his own film often employs. The screenplay provides its own definition of a rebel: ""Someone marked by fate and with real dignity inside."" Mr. Collard, by communicating his anxiety in such honest, troubling terms, surely met that definition. He leaves behind a brave, wrenching self-portrait and a great deal of unfulfilled promise.

Review/Film: Schindler's List; Imagining the Holocaust to Remember It - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from December 15, 1993, Section C, Page 19Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. There is a real photographic record of some of the people and places depicted in ""Schindler's List,"" and it has a haunting history. Raimund Titsch, an Austrian Catholic who managed a uniform factory within the Plaszow labor camp in Poland, surreptitiously took pictures of what he saw. Fearful of having the pictures developed, he hid his film in a steel box, which he buried in a park outside Vienna and then did not disturb for nearly 20 years. Although it was sold secretly by Titsch when he was terminally ill, the film remained undeveloped until after his death. The pictures that emerged, like so many visual representations of the Holocaust, are tragic, ghostly and remote. The horrors of the Holocaust are often viewed from a similar distance, filtered through memory or insulated by grief and recrimination. Documented exhaustively or dramatized in terms by now dangerously familiar, the Holocaust threatens to become unimaginable precisely because it has been imagined so fully. But the film ""Schindler's List,"" directed with fury and immediacy by a profoundly surprising Steven Spielberg, presents the subject as if discovering it anew.""Schindler's List"" brings a pre-eminent pop mastermind together with a story that demands the deepest reserves of courage and passion. Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr. Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again. With every frame, he demonstrates the power of the film maker to distill complex events into fiercely indelible images. ""Schindler's List"" begins with the sight of Jewish prayer candles burning down to leave only wisps of smoke, and there can be no purer evocation of the Holocaust than that. A deserted street littered with the suitcases of those who have just been rounded up and taken away. The look on the face of a captive Jewish jeweler as he is tossed a handful of human teeth to mine for fillings. A snowy sky that proves to be raining ashes. The panic of a prisoner unable to find his identity papers while he is screamed at by an armed soldier, a man with an obviously dangerous temper. These visceral scenes, and countless others like them, invite empathy as surely as Mr. Spielberg once made viewers wish E. T. would get well again. But this time his emphasis is on the coolly Kafkaesque aspects of an authoritarian nightmare. Drawing upon the best of his storytelling talents, Mr. Spielberg has made ""Schindler's List"" an experience that is no less enveloping than his earlier works of pure entertainment. Dark, sobering and also invigoratingly dramatic, ""Schindler's List"" will make terrifying sense to anyone, anywhere. The big man at the center of this film is Oskar Schindler, a Catholic businessman from the Sudetenland who came to occupied Poland to reap the spoils of war. (You can be sure this is not the last time the words ""Oscar"" and ""Schindler"" will be heard together.) Schindler is also something of a cipher, just as he was for Thomas Keneally, whose 1982 book, ""Schindler's List,"" marked a daring synthesis of fiction and fact. Reconstructing the facts of Schindler's life to fit the format of a novel, Mr. Keneally could only draw upon the memories of those who owed their lives to the man's unexpected heroism. Compiling these accounts (in a book that included some of the Titsch photographs), Mr. Keneally told ""the story of the pragmatic triumph of good over evil, a triumph in eminently measurable, statistical, unsubtle terms.""The great strength of Mr. Keneally's book, and now of Mr. Spielberg's film, lies precisely in this pragmatism. Knowing only the particulars of Schindler's behavior, the audience is drawn into wondering about his higher motives, about the experiences that transformed a casual profiteer into a selfless hero. Schindler's story becomes much more involving than a tale of more conventional courage might be, just as Mr. Spielberg's use of unfamiliar actors to play Jewish prisoners makes it hard to view them as stock movie characters (even when the real events that befall these people threaten to do just that). The prisoners' stories come straight from Mr. Keneally's factual account, which is beautifully recapitulated by Steven Zaillian's screenplay. Oskar Schindler, played with mesmerizing authority by Liam Neeson, is unmistakably larger than life, with the panache of an old-time movie star. (The real Schindler was said to resemble George Sanders and Curt Jurgens.) From its first glimpse of Oskar as he dresses for a typically flamboyant evening socializing with German officers -- and even from the way his hand appears, nonchalantly holding a cigarette and a bribe -- the film studies him with rapt attention. Mr. Neeson, captured so glamorously by Janusz Kaminiski's richly versatile black-and-white cinematography, presents Oskar as an amalgam of canny opportunism and supreme, well-warranted confidence. Mr. Spielberg does not have to underscore the contrast between Oskar's life of privilege and the hardships of his Jewish employees. Taking over a kitchenware factory in Cracow and benefiting from Jewish slave labor, Oskar at first is no hero. During a deft, seamless section of the film that depicts the setting up of this business operation, Oskar is seen happily occupying an apartment from which a wealthy Jewish couple has just been evicted. Meanwhile, the film's Jews are relegated to the Cracow ghetto. After the ghetto is evacuated and shut down, they are sent to Plaszow, which is overseen by a coolly brutal SS commandant named Amon Goeth. Goeth, played fascinatingly by the English stage actor Ralph Fiennes, is the film's most sobering creation. The third of its spectacularly fine performances comes from Ben Kingsley as the reserved, wary Jewish accountant who becomes Oskar's trusted business manager, and who at one point has been rounded up by Nazi officers before Oskar saves him. ""What if I got here five minutes later?"" Oskar asks angrily, with the self-interest that keeps this story so startling. ""Then where would I be?""As the glossy, voluptuous look of Oskar's sequences gives way to a stark documentary-style account of the Jews' experience, ""Schindler's List"" witnesses a pivotal transformation. Oskar and a girlfriend, on horseback, watch from a hilltop as the ghetto is evacuated, and the image of a little girl in red seems to crystallize Oskar's horror. But there is a more telling sequence later on, when Oskar is briefly arrested for having kissed a young Jewish woman during a party at his factory. Kissing women is, for Oskar, the most natural act in the world. And he is stunned to find it forbidden on racial grounds. All at once, he understands how murderous and irrational the world has become, and why no prisoners can be safe without the intervention of an Oskar Schindler. The real Schindler saved more than a thousand Jewish workers by sheltering them in his factory, and even accomplished the unimaginable feat of rescuing some of them from Auschwitz. This film's moving coda, a full-color sequence, offers an unforgettable testimonial to Schindler's achievement. The tension in ""Schindler's List"" comes, of course, from the omnipresent threat of violence. But here again, Mr. Spielberg departs from the familiar. The film's violent acts are relatively few, considering its subject matter, and are staged without the blatant sadism that might be expected. Goeth's hobby of playing sniper, casually targeting his prisoners with a high-powered rifle, is presented so matter-of-factly that it becomes much more terrible than it would be if given more lingering attention. Mr. Spielberg knows well how to make such events truly shocking, and how to catch his audience off guard. Most of these shootings are seen from a great distance, and occur unexpectedly. When it appears that the film is leading up to the point-blank execution of a rabbi, the director has something else in store. Goeth's lordly balcony, which overlooks the film's vast labor-camp set, presents an extraordinary set of visual possibilities, and Mr. Spielberg marshals them most compellingly. But the presence of huge crowds and an immense setting also plays to this director's weakness for staging effects en masse. ""Schindler's List"" falters only when the crowd of prisoners is reduced to a uniform entity, so that events no longer have the tumultuous variety of real life. This effect is most noticeable in Schindler's last scene, the film's only major misstep, as a throng listens silently to Oskar's overwrought farewell. In a film that moves swiftly and urgently through its three-hour running time, this stagey ending -- plus a few touches of fundamentally false uplift, most notably in a sequence at Auschwitz -- amounts to a very small failing. Among the many outstanding elements that contribute to ""Schindler's List,"" Michael Kahn's nimble editing deserves special mention. So does the production design by Allan Starski, which finds just the right balance between realism and drama. John Williams's music has a somber, understated loveliness. The soundtrack becomes piercingly beautiful as Itzhak Perlman's violin solos occasionally augment the score. It should be noted, if only in passing, that Mr. Spielberg has this year delivered the most astounding one-two punch in the history of American cinema. ""Jurassic Park,"" now closing in on billion-dollar grosses, is the biggest movie moneymaker of all time. ""Schindler's List,"" destined to have a permanent place in memory, will earn something better.""Schindler's List"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Blessing (or Burden?) of a Child's Chess Gift - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from August 11, 1993, Section C, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" isn't about Mr. Fischer, but it's well named. The film tells the story of Josh Waitzkin, a gifted young chess player growing up in the shadow of the legendary boy wonder, the one whose name is still mentioned in awestruck tones. Yet Mr. Fischer, who is seen here in old news clips as a boy playing against rows of different grown-up opponents and otherwise dazzling the chess establishment, is as well remembered for arrogance and eccentricity as he is for brilliance. Hovering over this absorbing story, the image of Mr. Fischer embodies genius as a double-edged sword. The price of being a prodigy is very much at the heart of ""Searching for Bobby Fischer,"" which is adapted from the book by Fred Waitzkin about his son's experience. As written and directed thoughtfully by Steven Zaillian (whose other, much broader screenplays include ""Awakenings"" and ""Jack the Bear""), the film seems to worry about the very talents it also celebrates. This separates it valuably from the standard-issue success story it occasionally approaches. The well-invoked world of chess has a similarly bracing effect. Mr. Zaillian's single smartest move has been to cast Max Pomeranc, an 8-year-old who is himself among the 100 top-ranked American chess players in his age group, as the story's young hero. This young actor has no trouble conveying the intense concentration that goes with playing the game, along with the slightly distracted air that accompanies anything else. Aside from giving a performance that is touching and credible in its own right, Mr. Pomeranc beautifully communicates the quiet enthusiasm of a true chess devotee. As the makers of ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" surely know, a movie aimed at the mass audience had better have more than clever chess moves working in its favor. So even though this film may do for chess what ""The Red Shoes"" did for ballet, it works movingly and most effectively as a family drama. The story's principal tension arises from relations between Josh and his devoted, somewhat overbearing father, Fred (Joe Mantegna), as Fred begins to understand the extent of his son's abilities. The film establishes Josh's gifts in a lovely sequence that shows him casually making chess moves from all over the apartment -- even calling out instructions from the bathtub -- while his father sits, dumbstruck, at the chess board. Josh's sturdy mother (played with affecting gravity by Joan Allen) understands better than her husband does that Josh's brilliance may also be a burden. She makes Fred see that when Josh initially loses a game to his father, it's only because the boy is afraid to win. And she understands Josh's attraction to the ""blitz chess"" games played in Washington Square Park, by a lively mix of street hustlers and chess eccentrics, where the action is dominated by fast-talking Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne). Both of Josh's parents are caught between two schools of chess-playing when Josh also becomes a student of Bruce Pandolfini (Ben Kingsley), a teacher who claims to remember every game Bobby Fischer ever played. The real Mr. Pandolfini was one of the film's technical advisers. As it follows Josh from brilliant dabbling into the cutthroat world of competitive chess, ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" hints tantalizingly at the contrasts this boy discovers. There is the difference between the avid young players and their much pushier parents; in one scene, the children cheer after their parents are forcibly kept away from them during a tournament. And there is the schism between Vinnie, who trades on speed and instinct, and Bruce, who seems to take an elitist and somewhat mystical view of the game. Bruce even counsels Josh about the importance of having disdain for his opponents, though the boy does come by such thinking naturally. ""Bobby Fischer held the world in contempt!"" Bruce declares. ""I'm not him,"" Josh insists."" ""You're telling me!"" the teacher says scathingly to his young pupil""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" never delves deeper than that, and perhaps it doesn't have to. Nor does it focus strongly on what chess is like for competitive players without Josh Waitzkin's skill and good fortune (at 16, he is now the highest-ranked American player under 18). The strains inherent in Josh's story come through tacitly as Mr. Zaillian concentrates more openly on the triumph. Though Josh falters, worries and even faces disappointing his father in the course of the story, he also reaches a pinnacle of Zen chess warfare during the film's excitingly staged tournament scenes. ""You've lost,"" he tells one young rival calmly during a match. ""You just don't know it.""""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" will be as lively and accessible to the chess-impaired viewers as it will to those who, like Bruce Pandolfini or for that matter Bobby Fischer, can look at a chess board and see events that are many moves away. In addition to its love for its subject, the film also displays believable New York City ambiance and interesting glimpses of various chess-related settings. (Conrad L. Hall's cinematography has warmth and clarity, and the detailed, excellent production design is by David Gropman, who did ""Mr. and Mrs. Bridge."")The Fischer name is specifically invoked at various points in the story, in a manner that is both exuberant and somehow chilling. ""I want back what Bobby Fischer took with him when he disappeared!"" Bruce Pandolfini says passionately in one scene. What Bobby Fischer took away, dashing the hopes and the innocence of his acolytes when he spurned chess, may never truly be recaptured. But some of it has found its way to the screen.""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested.) It includes mild profanity, but is otherwise well suited to young viewers.

Review: ‘The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel’ Ups the Ante - The New York Times,"Beyond its blindingly colorful palette, the pleasures to be gleaned from the sequel to the 2012 hit “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” derive from watching its eminent, mostly British cast ham it up while trying to inflate dramatic molehills into mountains. To get away with pretending that less is more, strenuous overacting is required. But for die-hard Anglophiles whose hearts go pitter-pat over actresses awarded the title Dame, it won’t really matter what the film’s most famous returnees say or do, as long as they chew the scenery. Leading the list are Maggie Smith and Judi Dench, peddling their irresistible brands of British hauteur. But be warned: If you haven’t seen the first “Marigold,” adapted from a novel by Deborah Moggach, you may find it difficult to figure out who’s who and what’s what in the seriously overpopulated “The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.” Because there’s no explanatory prelude in the sequel, you wouldn’t know, for instance, that most of the characters are financially stressed Britons, recruited to spend their sunset years in Jaipur, India, at a residential hotel that is much less splendid than advertised. After much grumbling and backbiting, they become a semi-happy extended family embarked on improbable romantic adventures. By hyping the pageantry and adding more stars, the director, John Madden, and the screenwriter, Ol Parker, who created the first film, try to compensate for the new movie’s lack of coherence and narrative momentum. But with no real story to tell, only so much can be done. The newcomers include Richard Gere at his most courtly, David Strathairn and Tamsin Greig (of the Showtime series “Episodes”). The second “Marigold” begins in San Diego, where the hotel’s hyperkinetic co-owner and manager, Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel), has gone to seek the backing of an international chain in the hopes of opening a second hostelry near the original Marigold; he gets cautious nibbles of interest. Shortly after his return to India, a suave American, Guy Chambers (Mr. Gere), claiming to be a novelist, shows up. Sonny assumes he must be a hotel inspector masquerading as a guest and smothers him with obsequious attention. Complicating matters, and adding another unnecessary romantic subplot, Guy makes a beeline for Sonny’s proper, widowed mother (Lillete Dubey). Meanwhile, the fledgling friendship of Evelyn (Ms. Dench) and the shy, bumbling Douglas (Bill Nighy) moves a step closer to true romance. For in the second “Marigold,” atmosphere is so overheated with senior desire that you begin to wonder what might be in the water. A stay at the Marigold Hotel looks as rejuvenating as a dive into the magically restorative swimming pool in “Cocoon.” In aggressively sunny picker-uppers like the Marigold movies, there is a thin line between adorable and insufferable. And in the second “Marigold,” Mr. Patel has succumbed to his tendency toward cuteness. His performance is an increasingly tiresome display of sentimental slapstick and attempted scene stealing in which he evokes uncomfortable memories of Roberto Benigni running wild in “Life Is Beautiful.” It all culminates in a grand, pseudo-Bollywood-style wedding sequence. The song-and-dance extravaganza celebrating Sonny’s marriage is the first of several endings that unnecessarily pad the movie. For the last half-hour, I felt like a party pooper as I waited impatiently for it to end. “The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""Second Best"" is all too fair a title for Chris Menges's new film, in which William Hurt plays a lonely postmaster who hopes to adopt a son. Casting Mr. Hurt in this role doesn't do much for the film or the leading man. The story, set in a tiny Welsh village, calls for an actor whose Welsh qualities extend beyond a faltering accent. And Mr. Hurt, hidden beneath long reddish curls and thick black glasses, needn't have tried so hard to convince an audience that he isn't a handsome American movie star. There are worse things, after all. Adapted by David Cook from his own novel, ""Second Best"" offers sincere therapeutic insights into its two main characters. James (Chris Cleary Miles), a sullen, uncommunicative boy who has been placed in an orphanage while his father is in jail, must come to terms with his feelings of abandonment and with his reluctance to trust those who care about him. James's troubles are interwoven with those of Graham Holt (Mr. Hurt), whose interest in this boy crystallizes his own memories of an unhappy childhood. Narrow and introspective as this may sound on paper, it's even more mysteriously colorless on the screen. Delving into these two characters' past troubles, the film never seems much more impassioned than the stiff, somnambulant Graham. Its one attempt at flamboyance, in the person of a chatty social worker named Debbie (Jane Horrocks), is strikingly at odds with the rest of the material. But Debbie is on hand to tell Graham, ""I need to know what happened to send you scuttlin' inside yourself.""What happened is explained by flashbacks depicting Graham's father at different stages of life, flashbacks that are often triggered by watching James try to resolve his own set of parent-child feelings. It's easy to imagine that the intricate texture of such overlapping relationships was better captured by a novel than it is here. Mr. Menges grew up very near the Welsh village where ""Second Best"" was filmed, and he pays faithful attention to his film's sense of place. But its dolorousness becomes all too real. The film's sad, sensitive mood is rarely broken by Mr. Hurt, though he becomes better and better as his character is pushed toward self-assertion. Mr. Miles, a straightforward young actor making his film debut, is a believable presence.""Second Best"" is finally more moving for the anguished father-son drama it might have been than for the muted, unfocused one it has become. There is much untapped pathos in the tale of a middle-aged bachelor, moved by his father's failing health and his isolation, trying to give a troubled boy ""a proper 'ome.""""Second Best"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild profanity.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. If you're going to build a career on bad taste, sooner or later you'll have to tackle the most sacred icon of all, motherhood. John Waters is just the man to do it, for he sends up only what he deeply adores. In ""Serial Mom"" he takes to heart the idea that being the All-American mother is enough to drive a woman crazy. What could be more sympathetic?Kathleen Turner leaps into the most delicious role she has had in years as Beverly Sutphin. She is a Baltimore housewife with perfectly bobbed hair, a sparkling clean kitchen, a dentist husband (Sam Waterston) and two teen-age children with names that seem lifted from ""Ozzie and Harriet"": Chip and Misty. But the strain of being a perfect mom is showing, for Beverly has developed a tendency to murder anyone who gets on her nerves. How dare a teacher suggest that Chip (Matthew Lillard) may need therapy? Beverly responds with normal disbelief, then finds the teacher in the parking lot and runs him down with her car. When Misty (Ricki Lake) is stood up by a handsome date, she will regret crying to her mother, ""I wish he were dead.""Mr. Waters, of course, no longer traffics in the truly vulgar, as he did in early films like ""Pink Flamingos"" (notorious for its canine scatology). With his recent lighthearted films of 50's and 60's adolescence, ""Hair spray"" and ""Crybaby,"" he entered the mainstream, where his sense of the tacky fit right in. With ""Serial Mom"" he concocts a cute suburban satire, a warmly funny movie that even a mother could love. The movie is milder than its premise makes it sound. Although the story is set in the present, Beverly seems stuck in one of Mr. Waters's favorite twilight zones: 50's sitcoms that shaped a generation of dysfunctional families. A detective who questions the Sutphins even points out how remarkably Beverly brings to mind June Cleaver, though he misses a crucial clue about the obscene note sent to their whiny neighbor, Dottie Hinkle (Mink Stole). The note is signed with a smiley face. As soon as the detectives and her loving family are out the door, Beverly displays girlish delight at muttering dirty words in an anonymous prank call to Dottie. Beverly is the kind of matron who would profess to be disgusted by a John Waters movie while secretly relishing every cathartic moment. The film is shaped by Mr. Waters's flair for capturing the excruciating details of suburban life. An especially nice touch is the way Beverly cheerily sings Barry Manilow's ""Daybreak"" while cleaning her house or driving to another murder. Ms. Turner plays the good mother with such sunny conviction that her murderous side seems plausibly self-righteous. And Mr. Waterston, escaping from many earnest roles, shows a flair for understated comedy that works perfectly for the befuddled husband. Like all Waters films, ""Serial Mom"" is uneven and often predictable. When the police close in on Beverly while she is riding to church with the whole family, she wonders, ""Do you think I need to call a lawyer?"" The astute Chip answers, ""You need an agent."" Suzanne Somers, in a cameo role, suddenly wants to make a mini-series of Beverly's life. The media frenzy about the latest mega-star killer is too close to reality to work as satire. Despite Mr. Waters's tame approach, there are still some disgusting moments in ""Serial Mom,"" including a close-up of what looks like a human liver skewered on a fireplace poker. He hasn't, after all, lost his sense of values. Who would you rather be? he seems to ask. The famous serial mom or the neighbor who, when a favorite ceramic egg has been broken, wails: ""It's Franklin Mint! I collect Franklin Mint!""One victim rents a video of ""Annie,"" settles into her easy chair and starts singing along with ""Tomorrow."" Legally that doesn't justify murder. But there are higher esthetic issues involved. They explain why, in the world of John Waters, this serial mom is a pop-culture heroine.""Serial Mom"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes foul language, sexual suggestiveness and some bloody murders. Serial Mom Written and directed by John Waters; director of photography, Robert M.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""Shadowlands"" is the most soothing film of the Christmas season, even though it happens to be about tragic loss. That's because it has been directed, in ripely sentimental fashion, by Richard Attenborough, an uncommonly reliable film maker on subjects both large and small. Most of Mr. Attenborough's subjects (""Gandhi,"" ""Chaplin,"" ""Young Winston"") are more grandiose than this one, yet all of his films can be counted on for the same homey predictability. When a painting of an English valley is revealed in ""Shadowlands"" to be a relic left over from a lonely boyhood, rest easy: of course the real valley will be visited before the film is over. As the autumnal romance that coaxes Anthony Hopkins out of his genteel shell, inviting the audience to join him in a spectacularly good cry, ""Shadowlands"" actually has lots of old-fashioned virtues to recommend it. Here is Mr. Hopkins giving an amazingly versatile and moving performance, shifting the light in those knowing blue eyes to reveal endless shadings between delight and sorrow. Here is Debra Winger, dying bravely in one more movie yet managing gracefully to avoid maudlin histrionics. Here is Oxford, filmed on a sizable budget, most of which has been spent on tweeds. Here is a screenplay in which Mr. Hopkins gets to say both ""beastly"" and ""balderdash,"" though not in the same scene.""Shadowlands"" is the unlikely love story of C. S. Lewis, the Irish-born writer and lecturer (whose theological works and Chronicles of Narnia books are invoked here), and the American poet Joy Gresham, who married Lewis late in both their lives. It was adapted by William Nicholson from his own play, which is loosely fashioned around biographical facts about Gresham and Lewis. The film's production notes quote Mr. Nicholson as saying, ""I have used parts of their story, not used other parts and imagined the rest,"" adding ""no one knows exactly how and why they fell in love."" But it goes without saying that much of the film's punchy, point-making dialogue is not quite verbatim. (These same production notes, which are pricelessly earnest, also point out that Bill Clinton, Margaret Thatcher and Crown Prince Naruhito of Japan share C. S. Lewis's link with Oxford.)Pedigree aside, ""Shadowlands"" offers a gratifyingly soapy love story, handsomely told. It is set in motion once the donnish Lewis, who is known as Jack and lives staidly with his brother Warnie (Edward Hardwicke), is visited by the adventurous Joy Gresham. Prim and reserved (who does this better than Mr. Hopkins?), Jack has known Joy only as someone who writes him fan letters. ""Her letters are rather unusual,"" he muses. ""She writes as if she knows me somehow.""The film makes a point of treating Joy like a bull in a china shop when she visits her first English tearoom. ""Anybody here called Lewis?"" she bellows, to the astonishment of Jack and Warnie. But Joy's crudeness, which is exacerbated by Ms. Winger's awkward Brooklyn accent, is soon peeled away to reveal the obligatory heart of gold and life-affirming sense of humor. ""I don't really go in for seeing the sights,"" Jack says haughtily as he escorts Joy around Oxford. ""So what do you do, walk around with your eyes shut?"" she inquires. It doesn't take long before Jack, who seems to have a natural abhorrence of women and children, develops a great gentlemanly fondness for both Joy and her young son, Douglas (Joseph Mazzello). But he is teased about this by his starchy professorial colleagues (most notably John Wood, as a prig named Riley), and so he keeps it secret when he marries Joy as ""a technicality"" in order to allow her to remain in England. Only after their wedding do Jack and Joy truly fall in love. But Fate is about to deal them a terrible blow, which prompts Mr. Hopkins's Jack to reach his full heights of eloquence and emotion. Mr. Hopkins's performance, a model of clipped diction and veiled affection during most of the film, becomes desperately intense in those portions of the film that deal with grief. The screenplay's most moving dialogue and most quotable quotes deal with pain as a component of love. On this subject, there is ample room for Jack's later observations to humanize his earlier thoughts. In his professorial mode, he has delivered a lecture, telling his listeners: ""I'm not sure that God particularly wants us to be happy."" Later on, in the film's anguished last stages, he says: ""Experience is a brutal teacher. But you learn -- my God, you learn.""""Shadowlands"" is acted with great tenderness by both Ms. Winger, who seems vigorous and sprightly despite obvious impediments (not least of them a matronly mid-1950's wardrobe), and Mr. Hopkins, who is simply wonderful. Among its secondary characters are the smug Oxford professors who learn about love through Jack and the book-loving student who tells Jack, ""We read to know we're not alone."" That's why we watch warm, weepy movies, too.""Shadowlands"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity.

These images and sounds usher the audience into the world of Robert Altman's big, tumultuous, very fine new film, ""Short Cuts,"" which opens the 31st New York Film Festival tonight at Lincoln Center. The film will be shown at 7:30 at Alice Tully Hall and at 8 P. M. at Avery Fisher Hall, and begins its commercial run on Sunday in Manhattan.""Short Cuts"" is a wonderfully apt selection to open this year's festival. It calls attention not only to the entire career of one of America's most brilliant, most engagingly original film makers, but also to the manner by which this bristly master has managed to endure. Certainly not by giving audiences what some pollster thinks they want, or by revamping last year's megahit. Mr. Altman goes his own way, though not exactly alone. Like all memorable Altman works, ""Short Cuts"" openly celebrates movie making as a communal endeavor. In this case, it's an endeavor in which the actors, whom he appears to adore, have been encouraged to realize characters to an extent that might not have been originally imagined by either Mr. Altman or Frank Barhydt, with whom he collaborated on the screenplay. The paradoxical result of all this collaboration: a film in which the director's personality is evident in every frame. Like Mr. Altman's 1975 classic, ""Nashville,"" the new movie is a vast panorama of interweaving narratives. Like ""Nashville,"" too, it's a movie that beguiles on two levels at once. One responds to its quite doomy vision of America-the-banal as it approaches the millennium, and to the apparent enthusiasm with which the film came into being. ""Short Cuts"" is a bifocal experience. It's sometimes alarmingly dispassionate. It raises the spirits not by phony sentimentality but by the amplitude of its art. From time to time, it is also roaringly funny.""Short Cuts"" was inspired by the voice and some of the characters in the short stories of Raymond Carver, who died five years ago at age 50. Yet it is in no way a conventional adaptation. It is Carver as re-imagined by the film maker, the locations transplanted from the Pacific Northwest to Los Angeles, which Mr. Altman knows so well that he and Mr. Barhydt create Carver characters the writer never wrote. The movie crosscuts among approximately 10 stories with two dozen principal characters. The paths of some characters meet. Other characters remain unconnected and disconnected, sharing only a messy urban landscape. Among the most memorable:Gene Shepard (Tim Robbins), a Los Angeles motorcycle cop who spends as little time as possible at home with his wife, Sherri (Madeleine Stowe), their noisy children and yapping dog. With his carefully practiced cowboy stride, he pursues women so relentlessly, on and off duty, that he can't even be faithful to Betty Weathers (Frances McDormand), the woman with whom he's being unfaithful to Sherri. Doreen and Earl Piggot (Lily Tomlin and Tom Waits). She slings hash in a diner and he takes what work he can find, which, when he's first seen, is chauffeur of a stretch limo. He drinks too much and treats her badly. When he's not in a foul mood, she drinks with him and is glad of the companionship. Howard and Ann Finnigan (Bruce Davison and Andie MacDowell), whose small son is left seemingly unharmed after he's hit in the street by Doreen Piggott, who drives a car with a For Sale sign in the rear window. Dr. Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine), the doctor who attends the Finnigan boy. Andy Bitkower (Lyle Lovett), a baker who specializes in name-on birthday cakes and makes malevolent phone calls to a no-show customer. Lois and Jerry Kaiser (Jennifer Jason Leigh and Chris Penn). Jerry cleans swimming pools. Lois helps support the family by talking obscenely on the telephone to clients who pay her by the minute, often while she's cooking dinner or changing the baby's diapers. Stuart Kane (Fred Ward), Gordon Johnson (Buck Henry) and Vern Miller (Huey Lewis), three pals who go off on a fishing trip together and don't let the corpse they find in the river interrupt the outing. After all, they reason, she's already dead; waiting 24 hours to report the death won't bring her back to life. It wouldn't, but not reporting the death changes Stuart's marriage forever. Stormy Weathers (Peter Gallagher), a helicopter pilot who takes sweet revenge on his estranged wife, Betty, with the help of a man who chances by to demonstrate a rug-cleaning machine. Tess Trainer (Annie Ross), a singer in a jazz club, and her daughter, Zoe (Lori Singer), who plays the cello and mourns the demonstrative mother love she never had. Strange characters, who are also utterly commonplace. Their passions are sometimes proudly announced, even flaunted. Sometimes the passions are nursed, self-pityingly, only to explode with fatal consquences. Mr. Penn's Jerry Kaiser hangs around the house, listening to his wife talk dirty on the phone, then furiously berates her for not exciting him in the same way. Most of the performances are astonishingly fine, but there is one that doesn't quite belong. Jack Lemmon, so fine in ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" nearly stops ""Short Cuts"" for the wrong reasons. Mr. Altman allows him to go on at embarrassing length in a soppy monologue that has a perfunctory sound to it, something extremely rare in this director's work. The film isn't helped by the fact that several of the principal actresses look just enough alike to create confusion about who is doing what to whom. End of reservations.""Short Cuts"" is more mature, less hysterical than ""Nashville."" Though the characters are seen in close-up, the film itself has the manner of something seen in a continuing long shot. It doesn't comment. It is amused by the eccentric, acknowledges the melancholy, and moves on. It gives the impression of being something one might like to read, not because it is self-consciously literary, which it isn't. No script could reproduce the experience of watching the film. Yet because the images are so packed with detail, it's almost impossible to take everything in at one sitting.""Short Cuts"" doesn't have the unifying event that brings ""Nashville"" to such a rousing conclusion. Instead it depends on an act of God, but it's a satisfying act that calls attention to the randomness of the lives that Mr. Altman has been looking in on. The lives are often desperate and the characters inarticulate, but the group portrait is as grandly, sometimes as hilariously, realized as anything the director has ever done. When future social historians want to know what the temper of life was like in one corner of America in 1993, ""Short Cuts"" will be a mother lode of information. It's also a terrific movie.""Short Cuts"" has been rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has vulgar language, nudity, sexual situations and violence.

Sheila Vand in ‘A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night’ - The New York Times,"detail by detail, incident by incident — gradually converge. In one scene, the pimp seizes Arash’s Thunderbird to help satisfy Hossein’s debt; in another, the Girl watches as the pimp, hunkered down in the Thunderbird, threateningly shakes down the prostitute. Time and again, the relationships in the movie are defined by the exchange of money and the tremors and eruptions of violence that invariably accompany its circulation. Ms. Amirpour shot her movie in Bakersfield, Calif., and she has obviously watched her share of Sergio Leone westerns. She can fill a wide-screen frame, and if you don’t mind narrative repetition and passages in which nothing much happens, beyond pretty people staring at other pretty people, you may not mind that she has trouble filling this overlong movie, which comes in at 107 minutes, when 70 would have done nicely. Still, she gives you much to look at, including an image that looks like Madonna (it’s Margaret Atwood!) on the Girl’s wall that suggests that time (and life) stopped for the vampire in the 1980s. The image reflects the movie’s humor and feminism, and suggests Ms. Amirpour’s complex relationship to appropriation. That complexity is suggested by the Girl’s look, which conjures up the “Papa Don’t Preach” music video in which Madonna wears a shirt and a pixie do borrowed from Jean Seberg. The video is a model of pop-culture intertextuality that makes a virtue out of its wide-ranging sampling, and much of its fun came from peeling its thickly layered influences. Something similar initially seems at work in “A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night.” This is a movie that, after all, invites you to play a game of Name That Allusion, with Dean, Leone and so forth. Yet even as Ms. Amirpour draws heavily from various bodies of work with vampirelike hunger, she gives her influences new life by channeling them through other cultural forms, including her chador-cloaked vampire. The Girl isn’t actually alone: She has lots and lots of company.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/arts/sheila-vand-in-a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night.html
FILM REVIEW ; Of Course He's Still Beating the Bad Guys - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from December 12, 1997, Section E, Page 16Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. It was a shrewd studio executive who decided that the ''Home Alone'' series didn't require the towheaded, hooded-eyed screen presence of Macaulay Culkin to stay alive and kicking. As ''Home Alone 3'' vigorously demonstrates, all the franchise really needs to keep going is a charismatic child (Alex D. Linz has replaced Mr. Culkin) with no great acting skills but loads of pseudo-innocent chubby-cheeked adorability. Put sophisticated remote-control gadgetry at the boy's fingertips, and get a director (the newcomer Raja Gosnell) with a feel for the kind of knockabout farce that makes grown-ups look like fools, and you have a refreshed formula that's good for at least one more episode and maybe two. Providing crucial continuity is John Hughes, who masterminded the first two ''Home Alones'' and is co-producer and writer for Part 3.''Home Alone 3'' is essentially a good-natured repeat of the blockbuster original, but with a different all-American family (the Pruitts have replaced the McCallisters) in an upscale Chicago suburb. Its hero, 8-year-old Alex Pruitt (Mr. Linz), the youngest of the three Pruitt children, is a mechanical whiz of infinite resourcefulness and indefatigable self-confidence. While his family is out of the house, Alex fortifies the place with so many potentially lethal booby traps that an intruder unlucky enough to force his way in will find himself plunged into a zany chamber of horrors. Even the family pets, a white mouse named Doris (whom Alex enjoys scaring by showing her a neighbor's cat through his telescope) and a loudmouthed parrot that can light matches, get into the act. The invaders -- who inspire Alex to do things like place what only appears to be a trampoline over a camouflaged, snow-filled swimming pool into which the villains eventually fling themselves from an attic window -- are four bumbling international gangsters who have got their hands on an Air Force computer chip that makes missiles undetectable and are planning to sell it to North Korean terrorists. Through a baggage mix-up at the San Francisco airport, the chip, which has been hidden in a toy car known as the Mutator, ends up winging its way to Chicago and into Alex's bedroom. Descending upon the community, wearing silly disguises and armed with enough surveillance and safe-cracking equipment to gratify the most technologically fetishistic fan of ''Mission: Impossible,'' the bad guys are unable to determine exactly where the toy landed and resort to systematically burglarizing the homes in Alex's neighborhood to find it. Scanning the area with his telescope while his parents are out, the boy, who is home with the chicken pox, twice observes a burglary in progress and reports it to the police. Both times, the criminals escape before the police arrive, and Alex is lectured sternly about turning in false alarms. Adult disbelief makes the child all the more determined to catch the culprits and clear his good name. In the movie's cleverest sequence, he equips the Mutator with a video camera and sends it bouncing across the street into a neighbor's house to photograph the criminals. In the funny extended chase sequence that ensues, the adroitly deployed vehicle tricks the gangsters into doing one uproarious pratfall after another, as they try to retrieve the apparently indestructible toy, which has the miraculous ability to leap over high fences. As in the original ''Home Alone,'' the combat turns more brutal once the criminals enter the Pruitt home and find themselves besieged by an astounding array of mechanical contraptions, several of them built like fancy slingshots. The difference between ''Home Alone 3'' and its predecessors is largely a matter of tone. Where Mr. Culkin seemed to take a sadistic, poker-faced glee in the injuries he inflicted, Mr. Linz expresses the more innocent delight of a child caught up in an action-packed Saturday morning cartoon. Behind the villains' comic grimaces, there's no real pain. Care has been taken to make the mechanics behind each prank appear as elaborately silly as a Rube Goldberg contraption. And in making the villains (Olek Krupa, Rya Kihlstedt, Lenny Von Dohlen, and David Thornton) buffoonish caricatures of television spies, the movie deftly spoofs a technological mystique that Alex's ingenious homemade defenses puncture again and again. In doing so, the movie exploits the generation gap in technological know-how between today's computer-wise whiz kids and their parents. In making Alex such a mechanical marvel, the movie strokes children's fantasies of remote-control omnipotence while reassuring working parents that their children, equipped with the latest in telecommunications gadgetry, will be resourceful enough to amuse themselves and, if necessary, ward off danger when they are not around.''Home Alone 3'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). The punishments meted out to the villains are funny, but many of them are also cruel. HOME ALONE 3Directed by Raja Gosnell; written by John Hughes; director of photography, Julio Macat; edited by Bruce Green, Malcolm Campbell and David Rennie; music by Nick Glennie-Smith; production designer, Henry Bumstead produced by Mr. Hughes and Hilton Green; released by 20th Century Fox.

Review/Film; Alone Again: Holiday Mischief In Manhattan - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from November 20, 1992, Section C, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. IF ""Home Alone 2,"" the by-the-numbers sequel to the third-biggest hit in movie history, is viewed as a learning experience, its first lesson is that originality is a dangerous thing. Its second, aimed at any child who ever dreamed of drinking Coca-Cola out of a Champagne glass, is that malicious mischief can be construed as no-fault fun. Its third, and most interesting, inadvertent notion is that time does not stand still, no matter how profitable it might be to think otherwise. Between this film and its seemingly very similar predecessor, there is all the difference in the world.""Home Alone"" became a hit by speaking to secret wishes any child could understand: the desire for independence, the novelty of feeling empowered, the triumph of defending one's castle against invading hordes, or at least against two cartoonish bozos. No one could have predicted that these messages would come through quite so loud and clear, or be presented as so much fun. And no one could have suggested, even in an age of slavish sequels, that the formula be replicated outright this time. So ""Home Alone"" moves to New York City, and does its best both to ignore and exploit this change of scene. But it also changes direction in another way: a film bursting with enthusiasm for a fresh, appealing fantasy has been replaced by one most eager to maintain the status quo. This film's only real show of ingenuity comes with its explanation of how Kevin McCallister (of course played by the one-boy box-office phenomenon, Macaulay Culkin) gets to New York in the first place. In establishing this, it actually toys with the audience's expectation of a carbon copy. Once again, the McCallister clan is seen getting ready for a vacation from their outsized suburban dream house, which was a small but significant factor in the first film's fantasy appeal. Once again, an alarm clock fails. And once again Kevin is threatened with the possibility of sleeping in the attic, where he was left behind last time. After thus nudging viewers in the ribs, the film makers -- the director Chris Columbus and the writer and mastermind John Hughes -- let Kevin get as far as the airport, where a man wearing clothes like Kevin's father's accidentally leads the boy astray. It takes only a few more wild coincidences to land the film's wide-eyed hero in Manhattan, a setting that is treated by ""Home Alone 2"" as a holiday gift. It's a long time since a film regarded New York with the wide-eyed, touristy wonder that is evident here. The mood is as buoyant as it was the first time, and the story of Kevin's big-city adventures is certainly fun. But there's a difference between watching a previously unknown child actor finagle his way past a grocery clerk and seeing Mr. Culkin, this nation's most stellar little boy, booking himself a hotel suite and a white stretch limousine. The ante is raised when this boy's once-precocious confidence begins to seem like second nature, and when he moves on from the job of defending his parents' house to spending their money. A plot twist that has Kevin carrying his father's credit card en route to the airplane expedites the boy's big plans, as does his use of a tape recorder to lower his voice during telephone calls; that's how he makes travel plans. Look for similar tape recorders in toy stores as part of what will surely be the season's second biggest movie-merchandising coup (after ""X""), and don't worry about missing the point. Much of ""Home Alone 2"" takes place in a toy store. But this film's home away from home is the Plaza Hotel, plugged so tirelessly that the screenplay works in an 800 number for reservations and a walk-on by Donald Trump. That setting is well used and well populated, thanks to a suspicious hotel staff led by Tim Curry, whose droll disapproval is transformed by Kevin's imagination into a seasonably Grinch-like vision. Rob Schneider and Dana Ivey give the film some lively comic moments by falling for Kevin's stupid-grown-up tricks. Those tricks are so similar to the first film's antics that some viewers may blink in disbelief. Again, Kevin tape-records movie dialogue from television and uses it to scare intruders; again, he constructs a dummy that casts an adult-looking silhouette. And again he matches wits, if that is the word, with the two hapless burglars who stalked him last time: Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), the two most birdbrained adult males who ever figured in a little boy's daydream. Once again, Kevin subjects Harry and Marv to terrible tortures in the name of fun. But Kevin does not happen to be defending his home this time. Indeed, the setup is so awkward that the boy and his pursuers wind up running from the Plaza to West 95th Street, just so they can play out the film's long-awaited endgame in an empty brownstone. It is here that Kevin throws bricks off the roof onto Marv's forehead, puts a staple through Marv's nose, sets Harry's hair on fire (in a stunt that turns particularly dangerous when Harry soaks his head in a kerosene-filled toilet), inflicts a series of spine-cracking injuries and otherwise works out his aggressive whims. Many children will find this funny, and many parents will not. It's much more violent than the first film's comparable set of dirty tricks. And Kevin, removed from his embattled home, seems much more cavalier, possibly even meaner than his bullying older brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray).""Home Alone 2"" may be lazily conceived, but it is staged with a sense of occasion and a lot of holiday cheer. The return of Mr. Culkin in this role is irresistible, even if this utterly natural comic actor has been given little new to do. Mr. Pesci and Mr. Stern bring great gusto to their characters' stupidity, to the point where they are far funnier just walking and talking than they are being hurt. Catherine O'Hara and John Heard give amusing reprises their earlier roles as Kevin's parents, and do some memorable squirming when asked to explain their child-losing mishap to the police. Kieran Culkin, playing Kevin's pesky little brother, is a reminder that this is a family to be reckoned with. And a snowy-haired Eddie Bracken fills much of the film's sentimentality quota as a toy mogul who loves to help sick children. The rest of that quota is taken care of by the estimable Brenda Fricker, who won an Oscar as the mother in ""My Left Foot"" and brings surprising grace and stature to the role of a pigeon lady in Central Park. As an echo of the lonely old man played by Roberts Blossom in the first film, this character would be the most shameless element in this one; that is, if bits of John Williams's score didn't sound like ""The Nutcracker,"" too.""Home Alone 2"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity and considerable violence.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Ask any 8-year-old what a sugarplum is and you'll get a blank stare. Kids today have tougher questions to deal with. As a little girl asks in ""Home Alone,"" ""Does Santa Claus have to go through customs?"" That's the holiday spirit behind this surprisingly charming film, which may be the first Christmas black comedy for children. Forget old-fashioned sweetness and light. Here is the story of a large suburban family that accidentally leaves its youngest child behind when it flies off to Paris for Christmas. Kevin is a wide-eyed, savvy child who responds to being the picked-on youngest of five by asking wistfully, ""Why do I always get treated like scum?"" One morning he wakes up alone in the slightly creepy, too-quiet house to discover his fondest wish has come true. Looking straight into the camera, he smiles and gloats, ""I made my family disappear!"" Kevin has the potential to be the mawkish child or the obnoxious little adult so common on screen, but he is neither. Played with great glee by Macaulay Culkin, he is a totally endearing, up-to-the-minute little boy. Kevin's believable, smart-kid attitude is typical of the film's creators, who in the past have mined this suburban turf with mixed results. The film was written and produced by John Hughes (who made Molly Ringwald a teen-age idol in films like ""16 Candles"" and turned family life into a bad joke in ""Uncle Buck""), and was directed by Chris Columbus (""Adventures in Baby-Sitting""). The first half of ""Home Alone"" is as flat and unsurprising as its cute little premise suggests. Left on his own, with the phone out of order and the neighbors away, Kevin eats junk food and accidentally sets his brother's pet spider loose -- predictable comic touches. It doesn't pay to wonder how he orders pizza without a phone. And there are lengthy, tangled scenes showing how loving parents (John Heard is Dad and Catherine O'Hara is Mom) misplace their son during a frantic race to the airport. But in the second half, the plot becomes more outlandish, the boy a resourceful daredevil and the comedy wilder. Kevin's house is targeted by two determined but dimwitted burglars, so he sabotages the entrances, with outrageous slapstick results. Every now and then we see his parents desperately trying to arrange a return flight. On the final leg back, Mom hitches a ride with a polka band led by John Candy, a sure sign of maternal devotion bordering on martyrdom. But Kevin is taking care of himself like a human ninja turtle, indulging in every child's fantasy of taking over the house and becoming the hero of his own adventure. He uses gunshots on a videotape as threatening sound effects and scatters the floor with toy trucks for the robbers to trip on. He boobytraps the front stairs with ice and the back stairs with tar. As the burglars, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern (and their stunt doubles) respond exactly like cartoons. They do not just slip on the ice, they somersault over it. When Mr. Pesci's hair gets singed off the top of his scalp, he dips his head in the snow for relief. All that's missing from these cartoon scenes are stars flashing around the crooks' dazed heads. Even so carefree and wry a comedy needs its redeeming lesson, though. For Kevin, it comes when he runs from the robbers and hides in a church, where carolers sing and where he encounters the gruff-looking old man next door -- the man seen earlier shoveling his walk and called by Kevin's older brother ""The South Bend Shovel Slayer."" Of course he turns out to be kinder than Santa. He and Kevin teach each other the true importance of family. Yet even this scene, the most sentimental, is not overplayed. Neither is the ending, when Kevin gets his new fondest wish -- his family reappears.""Home Alone"" does, after all, have its sweet side. But it's a side best appreciated by the kind of ultra-modern kids who might wonder about Santa's passport.""Home Alone"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There is a bit of harsh language, and some physical stunts no child should emulate.

‘Ghost Tropic’ Review: A Missed Stop and a Long Walk Home - The New York Times,"the story of how she returns home — beguiles and fascinates on several levels. Devos and the cinematographer Grimm Vandekerckhove, working in 16-millimeter, capture the sleeping outer portions of Brussels with visionary skill. The focus is often skewed so that streetlights and traffic lights grow and dance before the viewer’s eyes. (Some sequences are reminiscent of the underseen 2007 feature “Quiet City,” an overnight pastoral of normally noisy Brooklyn from the American director Aaron Katz.)There’s more than an inspired impressionism at work here. Khadija encounters a homeless man and his dog. She gets help from a young woman running a gas station convenience store. These exchanges, and others, contain resonant observations of life as it’s lived by people who are, to varying degrees, disenfranchised — like immigrants and single moms. “Everybody needs a place to rest,” Bruce Springsteen sings in one of his 1980s hits. This movie is a strong depiction of people who’ve richly earned such a place. Ghost TropicNot rated. In Dutch and French, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 25 minutes.

‘The Ghost of Peter Sellers’ Review: Inside a Cursed Comedy - The New York Times,"and most of it did — when Medak and his notoriously mercurial star, Peter Sellers (who died in 1980), headed to Cyprus to film “Ghost in the Noonday Sun,” a farcical take on 17th-century piracy. Neither arrived prepared, with Medak now acknowledging it was inviting catastrophe to film at sea with a star who appeared not to have read the script (partly written by Sellers’s friend and frequent comic collaborator Spike Milligan). Calamitous from the outset, the shoot began with a drunken captain steering their sailing ship onto rocks and Sellers, upset over a recent breakup with Liza Minnelli, immediately determined to sabotage the production. His chronic lateness, script complaints and frequent disappearances — he even faked a heart attack — turned filming into a nightmare and his young director into a basket case. Fresh from the success of “The Ruling Class” the year before, Medak was ill-prepared for a star who, having taken umbrage at his co-star, Anthony Franciosa, simply refused to share scenes with him. Still obsessing over this disaster more than four decades later, Medak — who would go on to make a series of notable films like “The Changeling” (1980) and “The Krays” (1990) — returns to Cyprus to wander and ponder his near-derailed career. Marvelous archival clips from the troubled film play like dissociated, outlandish skits, the kind of inspired madness that often resulted whenever Sellers and Milligan shared the limelight. “I mean, it’s not as though we didn’t know Peter was nuts,” the producer John Heyman says, grinning amiably. “Truth of the matter is, none of us knew how nuts.” Yet Medak takes full blame for his role in the debacle, his admiration for Sellers’s tormented genius as evident as his own psychological wounds from a childhood in Nazi-occupied Hungary and later personal tragedies. This introspection gives the film an emotionalism that its entertaining contributors respond to with bracing, pick-yourself-up pragmatism. Neither bitter nor maudlin, “The Ghost of Peter Sellers” is a movie about filmmaking and soul-searching, a tale of two Peters and maybe the worst of times for both.

‘Ghost Stories’ Review: Bollywood Aims for Frights - The New York Times,"and the shortcomings — of the current tastemakers of Hindi film. Zoya Akhtar, Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee and Karan Johar direct vastly different shorts about contemporary Indian characters pushed to various stages of madness. There are terrifying in-laws, unexplained sounds in the hallway, violent miscarriages, gruesome revelations and one particularly frightening mob of village cannibals. Bollywood’s usual focus on romance and family melodrama hasn’t allowed for a thriving horror genre, but with this anthology, each of these filmmakers tries their hand at local screams and moody creeps. The films are at their most unsettling when they draw their supernatural fears from India’s lived reality — mob violence, intergenerational conflicts and women’s suffering. In promotional interviews for “Ghost Stories,” all four directors have discussed the artistic freedom of creating content for the global streaming giant, freed from the country’s cutthroat theatrical business model and the censors at the Central Board of Film Certification. For audiences, however, the results are a mixed bag. Kashyap transforms the trauma of a miscarriage into a stylized psychological thriller in which a jealous nephew uses his malicious supernatural powers to inflict pain on his pregnant aunt. Akhtar, whose masterful film “Gully Boy” was India’s official Oscar submission for international feature this season, tells the story of a young nurse caring for a senile woman who may not be as ill as she seems. With exquisite production values — dramatic apartments and severe color palettes — these two segments showcase the technical prowess of contemporary Indian cinema and the acting talents of a new wave of performers. The least successful episode comes from Johar, the most commercial of the filmmaking foursome. In line with his existing oeuvre of glossy Bollywood extravaganzas like “Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham …” (2001) and “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil” (2016), Johar’s ghost story stars a preternaturally attractive married couple and a palatial estate. The couple is haunted by the groom’s deceased grandmother who even interrupts a sex scene with her not-so-subtle entrance. It’s mostly ridiculous and an embarrassingly unsuccessful attempt to infuse psychological horror with Bollywood’s typical mix of melodrama and flashy masala. Things get much more interesting with the contribution from Banerjee, who is arguably the most promising contemporary filmmaker working in commercial Hindi cinema. “Ghost Stories” marks his first foray into horror following the critical success of social and political dramas like “Khosla Ka Ghosla!” (2006) and “Shanghai” (2012). With his searing intelligence and filmmaking gifts, he crafts a story of a rural village where the sole survivors of a mysterious affliction are two young children. As fanged monsters begin to appear from the wilderness, Banerjee remains true to the sensory possibilities of the genre while offering a powerful analogy for India’s rising tide of political violence and division in the midst of a wave of Hindu nationalism. “Ghost Stories” is the third anthology film by this foursome of Indian filmmakers. As with any samplers, however, there are some tastes better left forgotten and others one hopes will be expanded into fuller, even more terrifying forms. Ghost StoriesNot rated.

‘Everybody’s Everything’ Review: The Life and Songs of Lil Peep - The New York Times,"he’s soft-spoken and unaffectedly friendly. Another, when he takes the stage intoxicated, is disturbing. “Everybody’s Everything” (the title comes from one of his final Instagram posts) doesn’t spend enough time on Peep’s lyrics and music-making process. And it was completed before a recent contentious lawsuit was filed by his mother against her son’s talent agency and label, whom she accuses of plying him with drugs. Nevertheless, the documentary, which counts Terrence Malick among its executive producers, is an engaging account of Peep’s life and the alt-music scene. So often here, we see the rapper smiling. It’s a grin brimming with joy, and a smile that, today, makes his death feel all the more sorrowful. Everybody’s EverythingNot rated.

‘Ghost Fleet’ Review: A Quest to End Slavery at Sea - The New York Times,"The most caustic sequence in “Ghost Fleet” comes at the end, when a montage runs chronologically backward to follow a fish from a plate back to the water. This documentary, directed by Shannon Service and Jeffrey Waldron, describes how trafficking networks trick Southeast Asian migrant workers into lives of forced labor aboard ships to satisfy the demands of Thailand’s sprawling seafood industry. (Service reported on the issue for National Public Radio in 2012.)The movie primarily observes Patima Tungpuchayakul, a labor activist in Thailand seeking to rescue the fishermen and obtain compensation for them. She travels to Indonesia looking for men who have escaped the boats and information about the offending fishing companies. In some cases the men she encounters spent years at sea before breaking free. We’re told that the sort of nosing around Tungpuchayakul engages in can get you killed. In the eeriest sequence, filmed at night, she and her colleagues discover a secret fishing outpost the men have told her about. The film also includes harrowing testimony from survivors. One man describes swimming to retrieve the head of a friend who was decapitated by a rope on the boat. “I thought he should have a full body even though he was dead,” he says. Re-enactment footage acts as visual padding that dilutes the words’ power. “Ghost Fleet” hits its marks as advocacy, but editing might have put more emphasis on the individual men, added further detail about the illicit networks or tracked Tungpuchayakul’s journey in a more focused and suspenseful manner.

‘Island of the Hungry Ghosts’ Review: Migration and Trauma on Christmas Island - The New York Times,"“Blessings to those in between,” a Chinese woman says near the end of Gabrielle Brady’s ethereal, intensely moving documentary, “Island of the Hungry Ghosts.” She’s speaking to her ancestors, brought to the Australian territory of Christmas Island over 100 years ago to work the mines and whose spirits are believed to haunt this wild, strangely forbidding place. Her benediction, though, could just as easily be directed at the island’s other migrants: the hundreds of asylum seekers housed indefinitely in a gigantic detention center deep in the woods, and the millions of red crabs that make the perilous journey to the ocean each year to mate. Workers build makeshift bridges to help the crabs cross a roadside ditch, but our sole bridge to the detainees is Poh Lin Lee, a demoralized trauma counselor whose patients are slowly deteriorating. Unfolding without narration or pushy musical cues, “Island of the Hungry Ghosts” (filmed from 2014-17) explores, with great delicacy, the agony of living in limbo. As Poh Lin struggles to process the horrors and humiliations that necessitate her work, she also begins to question her complicity in an increasingly secretive system. Yet the movie doesn’t harangue, making its points with soft voices and often surreal imagery. Following Poh Lin and her young family as they explore the island, Michael Latham’s camera is alternately serene and agitated, thrusting through jungly undergrowth or gazing, bewitched, at a crimson carpet of crabs by a restless gray ocean. The result is at once acutely distressing and quite lovely, transforming the island into something primitive and inscrutable. Interpreting island lore, Poh Lin’s partner, Arthur Floret, tells their children that the jagged coastal rocks were created by a dragon to protect the island from humans. He doesn’t add that they didn’t succeed.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/movies/island-of-the-hungry-ghosts-review.html
"‘Clara’s Ghost’ Review: A Family of Performers, a Night of Hysteria - The New York Times","though like her character, she is married to a comedian (Chris Elliott of “Cabin Boy”) and their two children are actresses. With her real-life family as her co-stars, and her daughter Bridey Elliott as the film’s writer and director, Paula steals the spotlight in a story that reflects, warps and magnifies the thorny dynamics of showbiz households. Clara is the long-suffering wife of Ted (Chris), a comedian whose career has floundered. They have two daughters, Julie (Abby Elliott) and Riley (Bridey), who are each struggling to establish adult careers after child stardom. As the whole family convenes on their dog’s birthday, Clara is relegated to become the butt of her loved ones’ jokes. Disoriented and disempowered, she begins to have visions of a wild woman (Isidora Goreshter) who offers an escape from the role Clara plays in her family of professional clowns. Clara suspects that her raving visitor is a ghost, especially since she only appears to Clara — but this specter is warmer than the egomaniacal Reynolds family, and Clara does not resist divine intervention. Clara’s private, phantasmal liberation signals the influence of the John Cassavetes film “Opening Night,” but Bridey’s images do not aspire to the sensuousness of that inspiration. The Reynolds’ house may be haunted, but it does not look foreboding — in fact, it’s hard to think of any shot that is memorable in any way. Over time, this visual slackness proves to be a sinuous strength. It prevents the film from indicating its intentions, which would remove the mystery from the tense relationships it depicts. As is perhaps appropriate, given the comic occupations of the Reynolds (and the Elliott) family, this unusual, unsettling and terrific little film presents itself not as a domestic opera, but as a family comedy.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/movies/claras-ghost-review.html
‘Ghostbox Cowboy’ Review: An Absurd Entrepreneur Is Lost in Asia - The New York Times,"a scary, dryly funny dissection of entrepreneurial absurdism bleeding into existential and metaphysical despair. “Ghostbox Cowboy” is written and directed by John Maringouin, making his fiction feature debut, even though many of the actors here are billed as playing themselves; his 2006’s domestic documentary “Running Stumbled” insisted on a similar formal elasticity. David Zellner, who has a story credit, portrays the title character, Jimmy Van Horn, a Texan who bounces from grim boardroom to grim boardroom trying to sell young Chinese venture capitalists on something he calls a “transdimensional communication device.” Jimmy is thick but also arrogant in his racist condescension and much more. “Who are your influencers?” one of the Asians asks. “There are multiple influencers, one agitator and one violator,” Jimmy responds. He then tries explaining hot cakes to the men at the table, to be interrupted by one who says, “I’m from Cleveland.” The pointed humor is merely one component of this bracing movie, shot and edited to look like a documentary of a nightmare. “Ghostbox Cowboy” feels like a William Gibson adaptation directed by David Lynch and Jean-Luc Godard — while not directly lifting from or nodding to those artists. It’s rare that a release so late in the year is so noteworthy, but this is a genuine find.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/movies/ghostbox-cowboy-review.html
‘Sicilian Ghost Story’ Review: Fairy-Tale Love Meets Real-Life Crime - The New York Times,"A divine blend of natural and supernatural, fantasy and actuality, “Sicilian Ghost Story” reflects the horrors of a Mafia kidnapping through the prism of first love. Shadowing Giuseppe (Gaetano Fernandez), a handsome teen from a wealthy family, into the woods one sunlit afternoon, young Luna (Julia Jedlikowska) stares, entranced, as butterflies float on Giuseppe’s fingers and small woodland animals scurry at their feet. Her parents warn her not to see him, muttering darkly about a problematic father, but Luna is in love. And when Giuseppe misses school and is absent from his forbiddingly shuttered home, Luna refuses to abandon a search that the villagers seem strangely unwilling to pursue. Interspersing Luna’s quest with scenes of Giuseppe’s torment, the writers and directors, Fabio Grassadonia and Antonio Piazza (whose 2014 feature, “Salvo,” was similarly resistant to classification), flip the tone from bucolic to brutal with distressing ease. Water plops from the sweating stones of a dank underground cavern where Luna’s mother takes regular saunas (the wonderful sound design is by Guillaume Sciamá), and a mysterious lake waits ominously to link the living and the dead. Unfolding like a fairy tale and based on the shocking abduction and murder of a Mafia informant’s son in 1993, this beautifully realized movie casts a sensitive, secretive spell. At once mystical and gruesome, Luca Bigazzi’s sensuous images carve their own magical reality, daring us to disbelieve the telepathic tendrils that draw Luna to Giuseppe’s side. She may not be able to save his life, but she’ll fight to the end to honor their love.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/movies/sicilian-ghost-story-review.html

Review: Wife Returns in ‘Ismael’s Ghosts.’ Confusion Ensues. - The New York Times,"a nod to the young hero of Joyce’s “Ulysses.” And Mr. Desplechin’s characters sometimes soliloquize with words adapted from Philip Roth’s novels. This latest film, “Ismael’s Ghosts,” adds Henri Bloom, an aging filmmaker, to Mr. Desplechin’s oeuvre, and his name, of course, evokes the older protagonist in Joyce’s novel. For all that, Mr. Desplechin’s films cannot, or ought not, be considered literary. Cinema is the only medium that can accommodate the narrative sprawl that has distinguished this director’s work since even before “My Sex Life … or How I Got Into an Argument” (1996), a film in which he originated several characters who incarnate in his later works. “Ismael’s Ghosts” opens with a film-within-a-film, an espionage thriller about one Ivan Dedalus, a globe-trotting diplomat turned spy. (He’s probably related to Paul, but you don’t have to understand this convoluted situation to enjoy the movie.) Ivan springs from the mind of Ismael Vuillard (Mathieu Amalric), whose reverie is interrupted by a 3 a.m. phone call from his former father-in-law, Henri Bloom (Laszlo Szabo). Both men are still mourning the loss of Carlotta (hello, “Vertigo” people), Bloom’s daughter and Ismael’s wife, who disappeared 20 years ago. Ismael is now involved with Sylvia (Charlotte Gainsbourg), an astrophysicist, who, shortly after her introduction becomes the movie’s temporary narrator, and takes the story back a couple of years. On return to the present, Ismael and Sylvia hole up in a beach house, and one afternoon while sunbathing, Sylvia is approached by a woman (Marion Cotillard) who introduces herself as Carlotta. If you think this messes things up, you are correct, and the complications drive Sylvia away from Ismael. This turmoil comes close to driving Ismael, and Bloom, mad. Further developments bring back Ivan (Louis Garrel) — both his fictional iteration as dreamed up by Ismael and his real-life manifestation as Ismael’s brother, who’s come to see the filmmaker as a family idiot of sorts. There’s a lot of rage in Mr. Desplechin’s characters, especially the male ones, and as felt and articulated in this film by both Ismael and Bloom, rage is both terrifying and absurdly funny. (In this, Mr. Desplechin finds a close affinity with Mr. Roth, particularly the author’s 1995 novel, “Sabbath’s Theater.”) Mr. Amalric, who’s been a major player for Mr. Desplechin since the 1990s, is always adept at balancing on the knife-edge of hysteria and hilarity. Mr. Szabo is more magisterial, but also conveys the way that heroic men can be ridiculous. Ms. Gainsbourg’s Sylvia is a voice of reason, demonstrating that tantalizing sensuality and grounded serenity needn’t be mutually exclusive. But she’s no pushover. As for Carlotta, Ms. Cotillard sometimes plays her with confounding, slow-motion swagger. The actress also has instantaneous access to the character’s affecting vulnerability. Carlotta initially seems like a negative force, but she proves to be an object lesson about life’s curveballs and our tendency to overreact to them. As for Mr. Garrel, his exasperation as the “real” Ivan makes him the film’s most droll presence. As is customary in Mr. Desplechin’s work, there’s a lot of dialogue in “Ismael’s Ghosts,” but this movie’s nerve endings vibrate most avidly and tenderly in scenes where not a word is spoken: Sylvia on her first ride home with Ismael, looking up in serene rapture from a cab window toward the night sky; Ismael, angry and confused, framed between walls at the top of a dark staircase; Carlotta in tears, letting the blast of water from an ornamental shower head blast against her brow. It’s moments like these that make “Ismael’s Ghosts” an unforgettable experience.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/movies/review-ismaels-ghosts-arnaud-desplechin.html
"Review: In ‘City of Ghosts,’ Fighting ISIS With Journalism - The New York Times","the inspiration for a caliph in “One Thousand and One Nights” — is said to have played polo and perfumed the air with garments worn by female slaves. Raqqa’s later history largely registers as more mundane, a tale of declines and revivals that turned catastrophic when the Islamic State, or ISIS, seized it in 2014, making the city its effective capital. American-backed forces are currently battling ISIS for control of a city in ruins. “City of Ghosts,” a blunt instrument of a documentary, is an urgent and heart-heavy account of Syrian resistance from the ground up. Specifically, it recounts the story and activism of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, or R. B. S. S., a citizen-journalist initiative that emerged in April 2014 to secretly record the atrocities committed by ISIS in Raqqa. (R. B. S. S.’s website states that the group is nonpartisan and explains that it is “a campaign launched by a group of nonviolent activists in Raqqa to expose the atrocities committed by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and terrorist extremist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria” toward civilians in that city.)Directed by Matthew Heineman, “City of Ghosts” primarily focuses on three R. B. S. S. activists identified by their first names — Aziz, Hamoud and Mohamad — who, even after being forced to flee Raqqa, intently work to get images and information about the city out into the world. Mr. Heineman, who is also the movie’s cinematographer, more or less opens and closes the documentary in 2015 with some of the activists in New York, where R. B. S. S. received an award from the nonprofit group the Committee to Protect Journalists. It’s a distracting framing device that suggests Mr. Heineman believed that he first needed to give his audience reassuringly recognizable faces. Cut to David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, at the podium. “City of Ghosts” is best when it lets the activists tell their own stories, which they do in smoothly edited tag-team voice-over, in on-camera scenes from their life abroad and in ghastly underground images recorded in Raqqa. It’s an account of heroic resistance that essentially begins in 2011 when the Arab Spring reached Syria (“we started to scream for freedom”), and peaceful demonstrations against President Assad were met with state violence followed by power grabs. Along the way, Mr. Heineman furnishes a sketchy look at the various players and geopolitical stakes, glossing over Syria’s historical complexities and the role that the United States has played in the rise of ISIS. The activists come across as ordinary men made extraordinary by circumstance; some seem almost surprised at where life and war have taken them. Aziz was a student who became a spokesman, and Mohamad was a teacher turned reporter, but not much else about the group’s origins comes through. Mr. Heineman glides over the nuts and bolts of its operational beginning. He may not have thought it germane, or maybe thought covering it might have endangered lives. Or perhaps Mr. Heineman, an excitingly visceral director — his last documentary was “Cartel Land” — thought it might slow this fast-paced feature down. Like the Arab Spring represented in the movie, R. B. S. S. almost seems to have spontaneously erupted. That’s unfortunate because more information and in-depth analysis, as well as greater restraint in the use of atrocity images, might have deepened a movie that leans on shortcuts and visual shocks. In “City of Ghosts,” Mr. Heineman marshals some incredible material — including on-the-run undercover cellphone imagery — into a moving record of extraordinary individual and collective heroism, one that eventually emphasizes the personal over the political. You admire Aziz, Hamoud, Mohamad and their partisan compatriots. And soon you fear for them too, worrying over their every move as they fight an enemy that is scarily near. Yet as these men come into the focus, Raqqa and the region recede. As the activists struggle to keep Raqqa alive for the world, funneling news to outside agencies, the dead in this movie — decapitated, crucified, shot — come close to overwhelming the living. In a few instances, Mr. Heineman shows men being shot point blank in the head; elsewhere, he cuts way before the fatal moment, which turns these murders into appalling cinematic cliffhangers. He seems to believe that it’s crucial to include numerous unfiltered ISIS atrocities, but raw and blurred versions of savagery prove this false. Mr. Heineman is clearly passionate and sincere, but he doesn’t fully grasp the power of suggestion or the audience’s capacity for empathy. You don’t need to watch a man die to understand the horror of his death.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/movies/city-of-ghosts-review.html
Review: ‘A Ghost Story’ Has a Sensitive Specter With Time on His Hands - The New York Times,"let’s call him Ghostie, since even when he’s alive we never learn his name — indulges in some of the usual haunting behaviors. He knocks books off shelves, makes light bulbs flicker, opens closet doors in the middle of the night and subjects a terrified family to a full-scale, crockery-smashing supernatural tantrum. The effect of all of this on the viewer is strange and intense but not exactly scary in the expected horror-movie manner. In an age of expanded, digitally enabled ectoplasmic possibility, Mr. Lowery takes a tried-and-true, low-tech, Halloween-costume approach. Ghostie is a bedsheet with eyeholes. Possibly with some digital enhancement, but basically a 6-year-old’s idea of a ghost. And why not? We intuit his moods through the drape and droop of the fabric (the thread count looks pretty decent), and infer a brooding, smoldering temperament behind the cloth. This may be because the person inside — or at least the person Ghostie used to be — is Casey Affleck. Before his transformation into the title character, Mr. Affleck and Rooney Mara — her character is also unnamed — live together in a ranch house in the middle of somewhere. They argue a little about moving, but otherwise they pursue a low-key, harmonious, semi-bohemian existence. He writes songs and experiments with sound. She goes off to work in the morning. They whisper and look gorgeous and occasionally exchange tender, tentative smiles. In some ways these two (and the other human beings who show up from time to time) are the real ghosts in the story — abstract, almost theoretical creatures floating in and out of Ghostie’s troubled consciousness. The couple’s brief time together sets a hushed, poignant tone and establishes the dramatic and emotional limits within which “A Ghost Story” will operate. Not that there aren’t jolts and surprises. Just when you think you’ve cracked the film’s circumscribed logic, it opens up and goes wild in ways at once too wondrous and too preposterous to spoil. As a metaphysician, Mr. Lowery is not hung up on rules, but as a storyteller and an orchestrator of emotional effects he appreciates the need for coherence. Ghostie is not the only one of his kind in the movie. The dead (at least some of them) can communicate directly with one another and passive aggressively with the living. They can travel in time but not in space, which explains the existence of haunted houses. They witness our suffering and fear but have only the most limited ability to intervene, even though they seem to inhabit, albeit invisibly, the same physical world we do. After a while, Ghostie’s sheet starts looking rumpled and dirty. It’s the only one he has, and he’s been wearing it for a very long time. And time — the ways it can accelerate through years, freeze in moments and defy measurement altogether — is Mr. Lowery’s chief preoccupation here, his major theme and his raw material. At one point, early in her bereavement, Ms. Mara comes home to find a pie left for her by a well-meaning acquaintance. As Ghostie looks on, she takes a few forkfuls and then slumps down against a cabinet and keeps eating, without haste but also without pausing for breath. The camera stays on her for several minutes, which feels like an eternity. Eternity, though, is poor Ghostie’s problem. For him the calendar and the clock have no meaning, and as the film proceeds, growing darker and stranger, we feel his impatience and disorientation. What we don’t feel is the boredom that must surely be part of the story of his long afterlife. “A Ghost Story” is suspenseful, dourly funny and at times piercingly emotional. Daniel Hart’s musical score is full of pathos and longing, compensating — maybe almost overcompensating — for the literal deadpan of the protagonist. The movie may be built around a conceptual gimmick, but it feels less self-conscious than Mr. Lowery’s other recent films, the gloomy Southern crime story “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints” (also starring Mr. Affleck and Ms. Mara) and the sweet, borderline-twee remake of the ’70s children’s weepie “Pete’s Dragon.” “A Ghost Story” works so well because it shouldn’t work at all. Starting with a quote from Virginia Woolf, it wears its literary pedigree on its sleeve, yet it manages to feel fresh and inventive rather than stale or studied. It’s like an old tale by Saki or Henry James read for the first time: hair-raising and clever, a tour de force of sensation and a triumph of craft. Movies these days are abuzz with all kinds of paranormal activity, most of it aimed at delivering easy, superficial terror. The scariest scene in “A Ghost Story” may be the most human, when a random guy at a party won’t stop talking about the meaningless of existence in an indifferent universe. Dude, we know! Shut up! Ghostie’s silence at that moment speaks volumes, and his inscrutable presence is a reminder that fright may be an unjust, irrational response to him and his kind. We fear what we don’t understand, and a ghost is only human, after all.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/movies/review-a-ghost-story.html
"Review: In ‘Ghost in the Shell,’ a Cyborg With Soul - The New York Times","it evokes the original Terminator — but soon the skeleton is being dipped like a chip in whitish goo. This technological soup gives the metallic frame a humanoid cladding, making it more reassuringly and pleasantly familiar, from bosomy top to round bottom. It looks like a giant dream Barbie, hairless pubis and all. Enjoy these credits because they offer some of the more arresting, inventive images in this visually cluttered yet often disappointingly drab movie. A live-action version of a famed Japanese manga by Shirow Masamune, “Ghost in the Shell” is one of those future-shock stories that edges around the dystopian without going full-bore apocalyptic. To that end it is set in a possible future world that looks distant enough to seem exotic and familiar enough to seem plausible. The original manga takes place in what’s described as a “strange corporate conglomerate-state called ‘Japan,’” while this movie unwinds nowhere in particular, just a universal megalopolis filled with soaring gray towers. Anyone who has seen Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner” or that film’s innumerable 2.0 follow-ups (“Strange Days,” “The Fifth Element”) will recognize this “Ghost” cityscape, with its jumbled forms, neo-noir shadows, patina of art-directed decay and its conspicuous Asian-Hollywood fusion touches. Some of this tickles the eye, like the semi-translucent, pony-size koi fish that float through the air, seemingly just because they look cool. The koi don’t seem to be selling anything other than the movie’s production values and visual concept; elsewhere, enormous spectral human figures loom over buildings like embodied billboards, nicely evoking rampaging movie monsters of the past. The most important leviathan, of course, is Ms. Johansson, whose mysterioso cyborg, Major, effortlessly slides right into this scene, with her preternaturally still face – often as blank as a mask – and the ports in the back of her neck that she uses to jack into cables and other characters. These artificial orifices are pleasingly mysterious and highly suggestive, at once creating a sense of human vulnerability and raising the possibility of the posthuman. Major occasionally stuffs goo in her ports and also uses them to plug into others. About the only part of her that’s human is her soul, or “ghost” in the story’s poetic parlance. The rest of Major is a bendable, mendable shell, which makes her well suited for hard-core tactical work with a police outfit known as Section 9. As the title suggests, “Ghost in the Shell” is haunted, including by the original manga, its sequels and several excellent animated movies: the first, also titled “Ghost in the Shell,” and the entrancingly lovely “Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence,” both directed by Mamoru Oshii. The new “Ghost in the Shell” was directed by Rupert Sanders, who has made commercials and one other feature, “Snow White and the Huntsman.” He likes a dark palette and is good with actors, but there’s little here that feels personal, and he mostly functions as a blockbuster traffic cop, managing all the busily moving, conspicuously pricey parts. That’s too bad, especially because the original “Ghost in the Shell” is such a delightful philosophical plaything, with pleasures that simultaneously bewitch the eye and enchant the mind. This version, by contrast, ditches the original’s big, human, all-too-human questions, but keeps all the firing guns and car chases, the action clichés and intentional genre stereotypes. Stripped of its deeper-dish musings, the story turns into a perfectly watchable, somewhat bland action movie, tricked out with sharp details, some fine actors and one slumming legend, the director-actor Takeshi Kitano, who plays Aramaki, Major’s boss. He only speaks in Japanese; Major and almost everyone else speak in English. The characters understand one another, presumably because they’re beyond mere language and, in any event, they sometimes communicate telepathically. At first, the fact that they can speak to one another comes across as an inventive flourish, but like so much in “Ghost in the Shell” — the toddling geishas, the Asian extras — it helps to reduce an entire culture to a decorative detail. The movie has been widely criticized for casting Ms. Johansson in a role that was, of course, originally Japanese, a decision that isn’t offset by an absurd narrative twist that seems to have been created to forestall criticism but will only provoke further ire. This isn’t just appropriation; it’s obliteration.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/movies/ghost-in-the-shell-review-scarlett-johansson.html
Review: Goodbye to Giraffe Meat in ‘Ghostland’ - The New York Times,"“Please let us kill this giraffe,” a Ju/’hoansi tribesman entreats during a tour of the Kalahari desert in northern Namibia in “Ghostland: The View of the Ju/’hoansi.” Young giraffes “have very soft meat,” another tribe member enthuses. Since 1990, the Ju/’hoansi people, one of the world’s oldest indigenous cultures, have in a sense been unable to be themselves. They were hunter-gatherers until Namibia imposed a ban on killing such animals, severely disrupting their completely anti-modern way of life. Now they survive by entertaining tourists, selling handmade jewelry and so on. In this documentary, the German filmmaker Simon Stadler shows the Ju/’hoansi at work in Namibia. There are several ostensibly entertaining scenes, and some that speak to a viewer’s senses of both befuddlement and outrage. In one, the Ju/’hoansi dance, half-naked, in the dining room of a resort hotel before an audience of pink, overfed European tourists; the kitchen staff members, also indigenous Africans, stand at their posts with their arms crossed, in silence. Their faces are unreadable. In the middle of the movie, a German anthropologist takes four Ju/’hoansi on a trip to Europe. They are awed and perplexed by what they see. On the observation deck of a Frankfurt skyscraper, one of them notes, “Now we are where the wind is living.” This is an engaging movie depicting some sympathetic people, and is ultimately worthwhile. But there’s a one-dimensional quality to “Ghostland”; Mr. Stadler’s team obviously felt it was more important to record events than to explore conditions.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/movies/ghostland-the-view-of-the-ju-hoansi-review.html
Our ‘Ghostbusters’ Review: Girls Rule. Women Are Funny. Get Over It. - The New York Times,"a movie that is a lot of enjoyable, disposable fun. And enjoy it while you can because this doesn’t happen often, even in summer, which is supposed to be our season of collective moviegoing happiness. The season when everyone jumps onboard (whee!) and agrees that, yes, this great goof is exactly what you were thinking when you wondered why they didn’t make summer movies like they used to. Oh, wait, because whatever else you can say about the new “Ghostbusters,” it’s a lot like the old “Ghostbusters,” except that it stars four funny women instead of, you know, four funny men. In other words, it doesn’t have a lot of XY chromosomes and basso profondo voices, though its token hottie, played by a game, nimbly funny Chris Hemsworth, pulls his weight on both those counts. Otherwise, the redo is pretty much what you might expect from Paul Feig, one of the best things to happen to American big-screen comedy since Harold Ramis. Mr. Ramis helped write the old “Ghostbusters” and played one of its “professional paranormal eliminators” — as Larry King describes them in the movie — alongside Dan Aykroyd (the co-writer), Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. A triumph of casting and timing, the first “Ghostbusters” remains memorable for Ray Parker Jr.’s inane, dementedly catchy theme song (“Who you gonna call?”) and for Mr. Murray, who dominates it even more than its Godzilla-sized Marshmallow Man monster does. It’s peak Bill Murray with a minimalism that exerts a powerful gravitational force and a deadpan that recast Mad Magazine’s what-me-worry grin with the sickness-unto-death laughter of National Lampoon. No one performance dominates the new “Ghostbusters,” which is for the most part democratically comic (a Paul Feig signature), although Kate McKinnon’s magnificent, eccentric turn comes close. She plays Holtzmann, the in-house mad-hatter who whips up the ghost-busting hardware (proton packs included) with a crazy leer and page after script page of playful-sounding gobbledygook. Ms. McKinnon makes for a sublime nerd goddess (she brings a dash of the young Jerry Lewis to the role with a glint of Amy Poehler) and, in an earlier age, would probably have been sidelined as a sexy, ditsy secretary. Here, she embodies the new “Ghostbusters” at its best: Girls rule, women are funny, get over it. Written by Mr. Feig and Katie Dippold, the redo follows much of the original’s shambling arc and even revs up with a haunted-house boo, except that this time the scares happen in a mansion, not a library. After the usual narrative table setting, Holtzmann and her partner in kook-science, Abby (Melissa McCarthy), join forces first with another scientist, Erin (Kristen Wiig), and then a transit worker, Patty (Leslie Jones). Voilà, the new Ghostbusters are in business, complete with a vintage Cadillac, some funky digs and a cute secretary, Kevin (Mr. Hemsworth). Ghosts and mayhem ensue along with turns from the likes of Cecily Strong, Andy Garcia and Matt Walsh. It’s at once satisfyingly familiar and satisfyingly different, kind of like a new production of “Macbeth” or a Christopher Nolan rethink of Batman. As it turns out, the original “Ghostbusters” is one of those durable pop entertainments that can support the weight of not only a lesser follow-up (the 1989 sequel “Ghostbusters II”), but also a gender redo. That the new movie stars four women is a kind of gimmick, of course, but it’s one that the filmmakers and the excellent cast deepen with real comedy chemistry and emotionally fleshed-out performances, particularly from Ms. McCarthy and Ms. Wiig, who are playing old-friends-turned-sort-of foes who need to work some stuff out. They do, which means that “Ghostbusters” is also a female-friendship movie, but without the usual genre pro forma tears, jealousies and boyfriends. Friendship here, even at its testiest, is a given, which means that Mr. Feig doesn’t have to worry it and can get on with bringing the funny with his stars and toys, his ghosts and laughs. As is often the case with big-budget flicks, it grows progressively louder and bigger, climaxing in an overlong battle, though not before Mr. Feig has offered up some unexpected touches, including a cavalcade of beautifully designed old-timey ghosts and a genuinely creepy bathroom scene that adds a few horror-flick shivers. Part of what makes “Ghostbusters” enjoyable is that it allows women to be as simply and uncomplicatedly funny as men, though it would have been nice if Ms. Jones had been given more to do. (If this were a radical reboot, she would have played a scientist.) In the end, these are Ghostbusters, not Ghostbusting suffragists, even if there’s plenty of feminism onscreen and off. It’s hard to know if the movie started off being as meta as it now plays, but when these Ghostbusters are labeled frauds — or crack jokes about ugly online comments or take on a fan boy from hell — it sure feels as if Mr. Feig and his team are blowing gleeful raspberries at the project’s early sexist attackers. Big box-office hits are like ghosts: They haunt studio executives. It’s no surprise then that Sony Pictures wanted to resurrect the “Ghostbusters” franchise in some form, just as it’s no surprise that it took someone like Mr. Feig to figure out how to make it work, mostly, by not really messing with it. Even so, what he’s doing onscreen — by helping to redefine who gets to be funny in movies — is what makes him a thoughtful successor to Mr. Ramis, who made a series of memorable, soulful comedies about what it means to be a man (“Groundhog Day,” “Multiplicity”). Now, if we could just get women and men to be funny together, that would be revolutionary. “Ghostbusters” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Ghost and zap-gun violence.

Review: ‘Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension’: Goodbye to All That - The New York Times,"the sixth, if you include a spinoff — does acknowledge what slim legacy the series might have, it merely retains the qualities of the previous entries without adding much of significance. A young, affluent California family — Ryan (Chris J. Murray); his wife, Emily (Brit Shaw); and their 6-ish daughter, Leila (Ivy George) — are settling into a sizable new home. It’s Christmastime, and Ryan’s mustachioed, somewhat hapless brother, Mike (Dan Gill), who has just broken up with a girlfriend, is moving in for a while. When Ryan and Mike find a video camera and a cache of old videos left by the previous residents, they unearth a strange history, some of it featuring Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Brown), the young girls haunted by the malevolent and largely unseen wraith Tobi in “Paranormal Activity 3.” Now Tobi is visiting Leila, to her parents’ alarm. Cue a dark miasma gathering on the ceiling; mysterious writing appearing on Leila’s bedroom wall; and a visit from a priest (Michael Krawic) attempting an “extermination,” he says, “not an exorcism.” The child actor Aiden Lovekamp, from “Paranormal Activity 4,” makes an appearance, but not the appealing Katie Featherston, whose presence enhanced other chapters in the series. Humor and jagged jump cuts, both series staples, are in abundant supply. Most “Paranormal” installments raise the technology bar a notch higher than their predecessor, often to diminished charm. “Paranormal 4” played with Skype; “The Ghost Dimension” ushers in 3-D, which, aside from floating specter dust, an impalement and tricks with flying furniture, doesn’t bring much to the party. Nor does the plot. But then, the “Paranormal Activity” movies have always been about carnival-ride sensations, the narrative through-line secondary. That’s fortunate, because those seeking closure to what continuity there has been will go home mostly disappointed. “Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Naughty language and a suggestion of drug use. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/movies/review-paranormal-activity-the-ghost-dimension-goodbye-to-all-that.html
"Review: In ‘Pay the Ghost,’ Nicolas Cage Is on a Mission - The New York Times","especially when the actor is Nicolas Cage — is nothing new, but I worry that the dross in his career ledger is rapidly outpacing the gold. A compellingly idiosyncratic performer, he has languished too long in movies unworthy of his commitment and with no room for the seat-of-the-pants improvisations that make him so riveting. “Pay the Ghost” does little to correct that imbalance. Getting a jump on the Halloween glut of heebie-jeebie entertainments, this lukewarm frightener, set in an unrecognizable New York City, recycles missing-child drama through a Celtic folk tale filter. One year after Mike (Mr. Cage), a newly tenured English professor, loses his young son at a Halloween carnival, he’s still on the streets posting fliers and in the doghouse with his estranged wife (Sarah Wayne Callies). He’s also the tormented curator of a “crazy wall” — that hieroglyph-splattered signifier of extreme mental obsession. Unconvincing in premise or setting (the couple’s gloomily cavernous home suggests that teaching salaries have soared since I was in academia), Dan Kay’s filament-thin story, accessorized with flapping vultures and disturbing graffiti, relies entirely on Mr. Cage’s desperate-dad energy. Sludgy greens and smudged blacks assault the eyes, and crashing sound cues accompany every scare — dead giveaways of a director, Uli Edel, who trusts neither his audience nor his images. This is all the more surprising when you consider that Mr. Edel, with his 2009 thriller “The Baader Meinhof Complex,” displayed an aptitude for tension that’s completely missing here. Perhaps he’ll do better in the sequel, which a last-minute image may or may not presage.

‘Jessabelle’: From Tragic Car Wreck to Haunted House - The New York Times,"“Paranormal Activity” made videotapes the rage — in which her mother tells fortunes. Whether these warnings are serious is a question the movie dangles as it runs through the requisite scenes (including the old scared-by-ghost-in-bathtub routine) before an unsatisfying conclusion. In the lone effective sequence, Jessie and an unhappily married high school friend (Mark Webber) take a boat across the bayou to a shrine that hides a secret. A moment involving a damp grave gives the movie its only chilling image. “Jessabelle” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

‘The Ghosts in Our Machine’ Focuses on Animal Rights - The New York Times,"when they die, and they do — have lived horrible lives that are recorded by the photographer Jo-Anne McArthur in stirring pictures, so stirring that, her agency tells her in a scene perfectly timed to introduce her and her cause, they can’t be sold to commercial magazines in a PG-13 world. Ms. McArthur is our human window to these animals, whose early deaths are the ghosts in the global economic machine, and we see her on travels to document abuse to pigs, dolphins, dogs and more. She’s invested. She’s a vegan. She’s calm and sensible, but, to some, she’ll be extreme. All this is skillfully established during early-morning spying on animal warehouses or in moments of comfort with friends and at an upstate New York sanctuary, where sheep gambol, pigs slop, and roosters high-step on kitchen counters. “The Ghosts in Our Machine” is a compelling movie, but its argument expands without deepening. It has great empathy for its subjects, the “incredible individuals,” the “nonhuman animals,” that it records. Human animals use other species: talk about an inconvenient, rather obvious but overwhelming truth.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/movies/the-ghosts-in-our-machine-focuses-on-animal-rights.html
‘Aladdin’ Review: This Is Not What You Wished For - The New York Times,"spoiler alert: “money” — may not surprise you. I know it’s pointless to complain about Disney’s drive to wring every last dollar from its various brands. You might as well complain about the animal sidekicks (and I will). But the movie itself, while not entirely terrible — a lot of craft has been purchased, and even a little art — is pointless in a particularly aggressive way.[Read an interview with Mena Massoud, who plays Aladdin.]The studio’s earlier cash-grab strategy was to protect the classic status of its “A” material through managed scarcity and lavish reissuing. Each new micro-generation of viewers could be initiated into fandom with a bit of ceremony: Here was an old thing that was being passed on to you in a shiny new package, a polished heirloom in the form of a special VHS or DVD edition or a limited run in theaters. What had belonged to your parents and grandparents could also be yours, whether it was “Snow White” or “The Little Mermaid.” (Not anymore with “Song of the South,” though.)There were problems with this approach, including the preservation of tropes and images that came to seem old-fashioned, and not necessarily in a good way. The patriarchal princess stories. The cultural and racial stereotypes. That kind of thing. But Disney, long committed to doing well by meaning well, has synergized evolving social attitudes with advancing digital technology to concoct a series of updates. None of these have surpassed the original, but that might be too much to ask. I can’t think of one — not “The Jungle Book”; not “Mary Poppins Returns”; not the recent, somber “Dumbo”; certainly not this “Aladdin” — that seems able to stand alone in the popular imagination. They are weird and grotesque hybrids, belonging to no particular era, style or creative sensibility, like dishes at a chain restaurant that fuse disparate food trends to produce flavors alien to every known earthly cuisine. “Aladdin” is not a cartoon, but it takes place in cartoonlike spaces that trade the grace and flow of animation for the cold literalism of computer-generated imagery. The animal sidekicks — a mischievous monkey, a loyal tiger and a malignant parrot — are neither cute nor especially realistic. The human beings occupying the frame alongside them look, with the partial exception of the genie, like people dressed up as Disney characters. They run and jump and dance and sing and wear excruciatingly bright costumes, almost never memorably. Aladdin (Mena Massoud) is a thief plying his trade in the marketplaces of the vaguely, vividly Middle Eastern fantasyland of Agrabah, where he meets and falls for Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott). Her father, the kindly old Sultan (Navid Negahban), is being undermined by his diabolical vizier, Jafar (Marwan Kenzari). Aladdin and his monkey, Abu, are joined by a magic carpet and a blue genie who grants wishes and also develops a crush on Jasmine’s handmaiden, Dalia (Nasim Pedrad). The casting is admirable. There’s a brisk, enjoyable early chase through the casbah — the kind of springy action that the director, Guy Ritchie, does pretty well — and a couple of Bollywood-inflected numbers that remind you, pleasantly enough, of the proud history of the musical as a film genre. Some of the voices may make you regret the reminder. (Scott’s is by far the strongest; Smith is not a great singer). You’ll hear a few favorites from the old “Aladdin,” with new lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Alan Menken is still a wonderful composer, by the way. But somehow the most familiar songs, rather than lending luster to this version of the story (written by Ritchie and John August), only highlight its incoherence. “A Whole New World,” sung as Aladdin and Jasmine take a moonlit carpet ride above Agrabah and other picturesque locales, conveys neither the novelty of flight nor the wonder of discovery. The visuals are tired and perfunctory green-screen placeholders. Similarly, the genie’s showstopper, “Friend Like Me” undermines its own premise. We’ve had an awful lot of shape-shifting, motor-mouthed “friends” like this one. One of the new songs, belted out with great conviction by Scott, is called “Speechless,” a ham-fisted attempt to paste some power-princess feminism into the film that feels almost as condescending as the women-in-battle sequence in “Avengers: Endgame.” And as for the film’s supposed lessons — that you should just be yourself and not be seduced by wealth and power — I mean, come on. What makes the Disney classics, old and new, so durable is their ability to fuse commercialism with magic in a way that overwhelms cynicism. When that fails, what we’re left with is thievery. Rated PG. Theft and mayhem. Running time: 2 hours 8 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/movies/aladdin-review.html
Review/Film; Disney Puts Its Magic Touch on 'Aladdin' - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from November 11, 1992, Section C, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""Master, I hear and obey,"" said the Genie in the storybook version of ""Aladdin,"" and his comments seldom went further than that. For an exercise in contrast, consider the dizzying, elastic miracle wrought by Robin Williams, Walt Disney Pictures' bravura animators and the Oscar-winning songwriting team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman in ""Aladdin,"" the studio's latest effort to send the standards for animated children's films into the stratosphere. It may be nothing new to find Mr. Williams, who provides the voice of a big blue Genie with a manic streak, working in a wildly changeable vein. But here are animators who can actually keep up with him. Thanks to them, the Genie is given a visual correlative to the rapid-fire Williams wit, so that kaleidoscopic visions of Groucho Marx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, William F. Buckley Jr., Travis Bickle and dozens of other characters flash frantically across the screen to accompany the star's speedy delivery. Much of this occurs to the tune of ""Friend Like Me,"" a cake-walking, show-stopping musical number with the mischievous wit that has been a hallmark of Disney's animated triumphs. If the makers of ""Aladdin"" had their own magic lamp, it's easy to guess what they might wish for: another classic that crosses generational lines as successfully as ""Beauty and the Beast"" did, and moves as seamlessly from start to finish. ""Aladdin"" is not quite that, but it comes as close as may have been possible without a genie's help. The fundamentals here go beyond first-rate: animation both gorgeous and thoughtful, several wonderful songs and a wealth of funny minor figures on the sidelines, practicing foolproof Disney tricks. (Even a flying Oriental rug is able to frolic, sulk and move its thumb, which has evolved out of a tassel.) Only when it comes to the basics of the story line does ""Aladdin"" encounter any difficulties. It may date back to the early 18th century, but the ""Aladdin"" story has a 1980's ring. Here is the ultimate get-rich-quick tale of an idle boy (a cute, raffish thief in Disney's modified version) who has the good luck to be designated the only person able to retrieve a magic, Genie-filled lamp from a subterranean cave. Once in possession of the lamp, the original Aladdin goes to work improving his fortunes. He acquires slaves, loot and an extravagant dowry so as to win the hand of a princess, eventually ordering the Genie to build them a palatial home. Even in the movie version, this hero, who has been made more boyish and remains unmarried, dreamily tells his pet monkey: ""Some day, Abu, things are going to change. We'll be rich, live in a palace and never have any troubles at all.""Compared with the sounder underpinnings of ""The Little Mermaid"" and especially of ""Beauty and the Beast,"" this has an unfortunately shallow ring, as do the two teen-age types on whom the story is centered. The blandly intrepid Aladdin (with the speaking voice of Scott Weinger) and the sloe-eyed Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin), a nymph in harem pants, use words like ""fabulous"" and ""amazing"" to express unremarkable thoughts. (Jasmine's main concern is deciding whom she will marry.) Luckily, they are surrounded by an overpowering array of secondary characters who make the film's sidelines much more interesting than its supposed center. The scene-stealing monkey Abu (with noises supplied by Frank Welker) is a particular treat, as when he jealously mimics the Princess or otherwise comments on Aladdin's adventures. As directed by John Musker and Ron Clements (the ""Little Mermaid"" team), ""Aladdin"" is a shade less smoothly paced than its recent predecessors. An opening number, ""Arabian Nights,"" gets the film off to a grand start but ends sooner than viewers will wish. A sample lyric by the irreplaceable Mr. Ashman, who died of AIDS before completing this film's score:Oh I come from a land,From a faraway place,Where the caravan camels roam. Where they cut off your earIf they don't like your face. It's barbaric, but hey, it's home. A lot of early exposition time is also used to explain the chicanery of Jafar (voice by Jonathan Freeman), the Sultan's evil vizier, whose chilling, bony features suggest a composite of Nancy Reagan (the animators have mentioned this as a deliberate reference, along with a more pointed one to Conrad Veidt in ""The Thief of Bagdad"") and Captain Hook. It's a long time before Mr. Williams's Genie makes his arrival, and some of the film's early moments -- notably Aladdin's descent into a daunting, computer-animated cave -- are on the scary side. But this ""Aladdin"" has so much in its favor that these drawbacks are truly minor. When it comes to Disney animators and children's films, this remains certain: nobody does it better. What will children make of a film whose main attraction -- the Genie himself -- has such obvious parent appeal? They needn't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is. And the crazily antic pacing of the Genie's outbursts will be utterly familiar to small viewers, even if they can't identify a lightning-fast evocation of ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" What will come through clearly to audiences of any age is the breathless euphoria of Mr. Williams's free associations, in which no subject is off-limits, not even Disney itself. When Aladdin promises the Genie his freedom, the Genie mutters ""Yeah, right"" and turns into a nose-growing Pinocchio. Late in the story, the Genie cries out: ""Aladdin! You've just won the heart of the Princess! What're you going to do next?"" And the Genie even alludes to the centerpiece numbers of Disney's last two animated films by flashing an ""Applause"" sign after he sings ""Friend Like Me,"" an heir apparent to the applause-getting ""Under the Sea"" (from ""The Little Mermaid"") and ""Be Our Guest"" (from ""Beauty and the Beast""). ""Aladdin"" actually has two of these sensationally playful songs, the other being ""Prince Ali,"" in which Abu the monkey becomes Abu the elephant, and Aladdin struts his stuff on a grand scale. Half the film's lyrics are by Tim Rice (""Evita"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar""), whose style is so much more conventional than Mr. Ashman's that the difference is instantly apparent. But the collaboration between Mr. Rice and Mr. Menken has produced a lilting ballad, ""A Whole New World,"" that provides the film with a pretty interlude. The soaring voice of Jasmine in this duet is provided by Lea Salonga, who sings with Brad Kane (as Aladdin) and offers more evidence of just how shrewdly this film has been put together. Of special note are the warm, dark tones of the film's color palette and its playful allusions to Al Hirschfeld's drawings (in the many curving, seamless shapes of the Genie) and to Erte's designs (in the angular chic of Jafar). Among the many animators who made stellar contributions here, particular mention must be made of Randy Cartwright, who has nothing more to work with than a flying carpet, and turns it into a charming new fixture in Disney's Anthropomorphic Hall of Fame.

Screen: 'Charge of the Light Brigade':Vanessa Redgrave and John Gielgud in Cast Hemmings and Trevor Howard Also Star - The New York Times,"I suspect—a movie that will baffle anyone whose knowledge of the Crimean disaster is limited to dimly remembered passages from the works of Alfred Lord Tennyson, the poet, and Michael Curtiz, the director (of the 1936 Hollywood version starring Errol Flynn). In 1854 Britain had been more or less at peace since the Battle of Waterloo, 39 years earlier. Its military establishment was still dominated by the ideas of the formidable old Duke of Wellington (who had died in 1852) and it was commanded by peers who purchased their commissions under a system in which men with the biggest property stakes in the country were most trusted to lead its armies. When Russia, seeking to enlarge its influence in the Mediterranean, invaded Turkey, popular opinion forced Britain to send an expeditionary army to fight the Czar in the Crimea. It was a debacle marked by inexperience, vanity and witlessness on both sides, and climaxed by the massacre of the British Light Brigade as a result of inexplicit orders. In an effort to cram as much information as possible into a decent, two-hour running time, Mr. Richardson and Charles Wood, who wrote the screenplay, employ a kind of grapeshot movie technique. They use marvelous, animated line drawings, done in the style of patriotic, mid-19th-century cartoons, to show the spirit of the times—the British lion's awakening to the challenge of the Russian bear, a busty Britannia saluting her brave sons. There are short scenes that are almost blackouts to introduce Lord Cardigan (Trevor Howard), the ignorant, petty, slightly mad commander of the Light Brigade, and Lord Raglan (John Gielgud), the old commander-in-chief who literally works in the shadow of Wellington. (Raglan frets about a statue of the old general that stands outside his window awaiting assignment to ""some suitable railroad station."")There are odd, undeveloped scenes of life in the barracks and in the great country houses. Captain Nolan (David Hemmings), who was later to play a crucial part in the disaster of the Light Brigade at Balakiava, has a curious and (as far as the movie narrative is concerned) pointless affair with his best friend's wife (Vanessa Redgrave). Like everyone else in the film, they seem to be Gilbert and Sullivan characters manqués. Because the point of view remains strictly that of the director, rather than that of any of the people in it, the movie simply charges along as a series of extravagant tableaux. Mr. Richardson (""Tom Jones,"" ""The Loved One,"" ""Mademoiselle,"" etc.) is a heavy-handed political moralist and an eclectic movie stylist. But he is also such a facile director that he inevitably puts good people and things into his movies. The performances are excellent. The costumes look like clothes washed and worn in a pre-detergent era. The actual events leading up to the final charge are likely to be as confusing to the moviegoer as to the participants, but they are visually stunning, and the final impression of the movie—the silence on the body-littered battlefield broken by the buzzing of flies—is suddenly very personal, sad and even relevant.""The Charge of the Light Brigade,"" which opened a reserved-seat engagement last-night at the Fine Arts Theater, is otherwise devoted to lampooning old soldiers who have already faded away. The reasons why are pretty well ignored. ""It will be a sad day,"" says Lord Raglan, ""when England has her armies commanded by men who know too well what they are doing. It smacks of murder.""This is high, entertaining dudgeon, but it's approximately 114 years late.

WHO would have thought, when Italian neo-realism was in full crescendo, that Vittorio de Sica, the dour director of ""The Bicycle Thief,"" and Aldo Fabrizi, the tragic priest of ""Open City,"" would one day be playing second fiddle to Donald O'Connor in one of the hackneyed costume fantasies from the dubbing chambers of Joseph E. Levine?This discordant state of affairs may now be witnessed at the Forum and the Baronet, where ""The Wonders of Aladdin"" opened yesterday, and the two men have never looked so miserable. As a bulbous caliph, Signor Fabrizi gesticulates frantically and rolls his eyes heavenward, pantomiming an eloquent renunciation of the falsetto dialogue that mercilessly issues from the general vicinity of his lips. Signor de Sica, as a genie with invisible feet, dangles awkwardly in outer space, looking for all the world as if Mr. Levine had hung him out to dry. When not recording the aging antics of this unfortunate duo, Henry Levin, the director, is focusing his pitiless camera at the midriffs of Noelle Adam, Michele Mercier and the sleaziest chorus of belly dancers since Sally Rand abandoned burlesque. Let it be said for Mr. O'Connor, whose Aladdin is relegated to the outskirts of the wide, wide screen to make room for this multitudinous display of pulchritude, that he gives his task the old junior college try. He preens and cavorts from pasha to post, and makes a desperate attempt to scratch his earlobe with his tongue. When all else fails, he demonstrates disdain for his surroundings by contemplating the tip of his nose.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. KEVIN COSTNER has come a long way after playing the man whose suicide was the peg for ""The Big Chill"" but whose role was left on the cutting-room floor. Since then, in ""No Way Out,"" ""The Untouchables"" and ""Bull Durham,"" he has become a fine, comfortingly old-fashioned Hollywood star. As a screen presence, he has the laconic cool of Gary Cooper and the informed, contemporary sensibility of Robert Redford. The manner is utterly natural, the profile taken from a Roman coin. From all reports, he's also a foursquare kind of guy. Now, with ""Dances With Wolves,"" Mr. Costner is the producer and director as well as the star of the kind of rugged frontier adventure that every 10-year-old boy dreams of living, and possibly every actor dreams of re-creating.""Dances With Wolves"" is not a vain endeavor for a first-time director. But when the time comes to sum up the Costner career, the chances are that ""Dances With Wolves"" will look less like an equivalent to Laurence Olivier's ""Henry V"" than to Burt Lancaster's ""Kentuckian."" What breaks through ""Dances With Wolves"" is not genius but competence. In most circumstances, that sort of comparison need not be made. It becomes inevitable, though, when the actor is of Mr. Costner's stature and when the film itself is so ambitious.""Dances With Wolves"" has the makings of a great work, one that recalls a variety of literary antecedents, everything from ""Robinson Crusoe"" and ""Walden"" to ""Tarzan of the Apes."" Michael Blake's screenplay touches both on man alone in nature and on the 19th-century white man's assuming his burden among the less privileged. The time is 1863, during the Civil War. After being cited for bravery in battle, Lieutenant Dunbar (Mr. Costner), a Union officer, requests reassignment to the West, saying he wants to see the frontier before it vanishes. When, finally, he arrives at his post, Fort Sedgewick, in the Great Plains country, he discovers a small abandoned camp. The exact place is never stated. This is the mythic American West. Because the film was shot largely on magnificent locations in South Dakota, it can be assumed to be the Dakota Territory, where, just a few years later, in 1876, Gen. George Armstrong Custer was to have his fatal encounter with the Sioux in the Battle of the Little Big Horn.""Dances With Wolves"" is by way of being a rationale for the ferocity of the fate that awaited Custer and his men. In this seemingly unspoiled wilderness, Dunbar sets about to create order in isolation. He assigns himself tasks. He keeps a journal in which he makes notes about the flora and fauna and reports the events of the day, including the appearance of a wolf, whom he names Two Socks for the whiteness of two of his paws. His is a highly romantic, almost euphoric state of mind, so that when some Indians appear, he embraces their tentative gestures of amity with the enthusiasm of a kid at a super summer camp. It's golly-gee-whiz time. As trust is given and received, Dunbar enters into the life of this Sioux tribe, whose members have remained startlingly free of contamination by the encroaching American civilization. Dunbar is as entranced by them as they are curious about him and the world he represents. He learns their language, listens to their folk tales. ""They have a gentle humor I enjoy,"" he writes in his journal. Later, he confides: ""It seems every day is a miracle. I've never known a people so eager to laugh and so dedicated to family."" He might be reporting for a magazine sold at a checkout counter. In the tribe is a beautiful young white woman (Mary McDonnell), originally named Christine but now called Stands With a Fist, who was raised by the Sioux after the massacre of her family. One thing leads to another; or, as one kindly Sioux says to his gracious wife, ""Has Stands With a Fist found love again?""Dunbar is so eager to belong that he offers to join his Sioux friends in a war party against some neighboring Pawnees. Only the chief has the good sense to realize that this wouldn't be very good for either Dunbar or the Sioux tribe. Dunbar stays at the camp and becomes a hero when the Pawnees make a sneak attack. As used to be said in 19th-century parlors, Dunbar goes native. He also pays a price that is meant to make vivid and tragic the eclipse of one civilization by the cold white light of another. There's nothing wrong with the shape of ""Dances With Wolves"" (which is the Sioux name given to Dunbar), or with its sometimes truly spectacular physical production. After seeing so much urban and suburban squalor in other movies, there is something immensely revivifying about the grand open spaces, the broad horizons, and even the changes in weather in ""Dances With Wolves."" The movie is like a vacation in the Rockies, but one in which the commonplace keeps obscuring the view. Mr. Blake's screenplay and Mr. Costner's direction of it are, with the exception of three memorable sequences, commonplace. The film is painstakingly composed of small details of frontier and tribal life that should be riveting. Most of the time they aren't. Though the details are specific (about, among other things, the Sioux rules for mourning the dead), they are presented in the perfunctory way of generalized statements in guidebooks. The Civil War battle sequence that opens the film is a beauty. There is another fine, almost Ambrose Bierce-like vignette involving a shell-shocked Union officer Dunbar meets as he is traveling west. The film's buffalo stampede is stunning. Once Dunbar has taken up with the Sioux and starts strutting around with a feather stuck in his hair, the movie teeters on the edge of Boy's Life literature, that is, on the brink of earnest silliness. This Sioux camp not only looks as neat as a hausfrau's pin, but also unlived-in. It's a theme-park evocation, without rude odors to offend the sensitive nostril. Mr. Costner may not be the best person to direct himself. There's nothing wrong with the performance, but another eye might have more effectively surrounded him so that the actor's flat, naturalistic screen behavior wouldn't set the tone for so much of the rest of the film.""Dances With Wolves"" treats the Indians in the cast with respect, and frequently translates their Lakota dialogue with English subtitles. Of the other actors, the only ones who stand out are Miss McDonnell, a persuasive actress even when dressed in a very fetching Indian frock; Maury Chaykin, who plays the shell-shocked officer, and Robert Pastorelli, who appears as a frontier character whom Dunbar justly describes as ""quite possibly the foulest man I've ever met."" There's no doubt that he smells to high heaven.""Dances With Wolves"" runs over three hours. Its triumph is that it is never exactly boring, only dulled. It's a movie in acute need of sharpening.""Dances With Wolves,"" which has been rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned), has some scenes of graphic violence that might disturb the very young.

"Review: In ‘The Lego Batman Movie,’ Toys and Heroes, What’s Not to Like? - The New York Times","the Sturm und Drang, the darkness and aloneness, the resoluteness and echoiness — in vocal terms. It’s blissfully self-serious, near-Wagnerian and demented. Mr. Arnett anchors the movie, though he’s nicely book-ended by Michael Cera, as the excitable pip-squeaker Dick Grayson, and Ralph Fiennes, who voices Alfred, Bruce Wayne’s trusted butler and operational aide-de-camp. Some of the wittiest moments happen early, before the story machinery starts humming, and involve Batman-Bruce wandering his mansion in his fetishlike mask and a silky red bathrobe, nuking his lobster dinner and giggling solo at “Jerry Maguire.” If Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” cycle suggests that Batman teeters on actual madness, “The Lego Batman Movie” ups the ante by insinuating that he has fully settled into near-Howard Hughes eccentricity. Not too much nuttiness, mind you, just enough to keep the jokes pinging and zinging, at least until the story amps up. Most of that involves the Joker (Zach Galifianakis), who’s not the transgressive opposition but a whining smiler desperately yearning for Batman’s attention. This isn’t as funny or engaging as the filmmakers seem to think, partly because a child-friendly Joker can’t have the scariness or anarchic threat that distinguishes this character’s better iterations. (He can’t compete partly because he’s nowhere near as loopy as this Batman.) Mostly, the Joker is the master of ceremonies for the rest of the villainous horde, a motley crew of creatures that includes Harley Quinn (Jenny Slate), who’s mostly a trauma trigger for “Suicide Squad,” another supersplat. As an object, “The Lego Batman Movie” looks as good as its predecessor, “The Lego Movie.” This one is similarly shiny and bright, though sometimes as teasingly dark as Batman. Even when the story drags, which it does as the action grows frenetic, the shiny and bright bits catch the eye. As in the first movie, the character design does much of the most meaningful work because it conveys part of what’s enjoyable about Legos, including their smooth-to-the-touch plastic surfaces and knobby bits (studs in Lego lingo), which you can almost feel in your hands as you watch. One of the satisfactions of Legos is their touch sensation, a sense memory that’s imprinted on brains, too. Basing movies on kiddie playthings is ingenious: It turns every Lego brick into a Rosebud sled, a portal into childhood. That makes resistance fairly futile, or at least tough, especially when the crew ushering you into the past is up to the task, as is the case here. Chris McKay directed this one, working from a jammed script by Seth Grahame-Smith, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Jared Stern and John Whittington. (Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who directed “The Lego Movie,” helped produce “The Lego Batman Movie.”) The whole vibe is, as the first “Lego” movie insisted with its deliriously catchy anthem, awesome, so, relax, enjoy the show, go with the flow. I mean, who hates Legos? Isn’t that like hating childhood?Well, of course not, though that gets to what’s frustrating about these movies, which are so insistently good-natured and relentlessly hyped that it feels almost churlishly old-school raising even modest objections to the fact that — in addition to being, you know, fun — they’re also commercials. It’s not new or news that movies have long sold stuff, including studio tie-ins and toys, as Walt Disney explained by example decades ago, though, like Pixar, he was also in the business of storytelling and not merely corporate-brand storytelling and building. Certainly there are worse things in life and definitely worse movies, including the “Transformers” blockbusters, which sell both toys and war. So, as far as commercials go, “The Lego Batman Movie” is just swell. But because its primary function, outside of making bank, is to extend two brands — Lego and Batman — it can’t help but disappoint. One reason that the first “Lego” movie worked as well as it did is that its novelty and trippier moments conveyed a sense of play and unboundedness, which is part of the appeal of Legos themselves. (It’s the better movie and ad.) The Batman story, by contrast, proves to be a prison, one its creators never escape. They toss around the superstuff and giggle at the legend, but they’re finally confined by the superhero story and its corporate sanctity. It’s a bottom-line bummer.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/movies/the-lego-batman-movie-review.html
Review: ‘Batman v Superman’ ... v Fun? - The New York Times,"a bromance or a buddy comedy, an album of duets. “Batman v Superman,” directed by Zack Snyder (“300,” “Watchmen,” “Sucker Punch,” “Man of Steel”), is none of those things. It is about as diverting as having a porcelain sink broken over your head (one of the more amusing things that happens onscreen). In keeping with current business imperatives, what Mr. Snyder has concocted is less a free-standing film than the opening argument in a very long trial. Its two-and-a-half-hour running time — not so much a “dawn” as an entire morning spent watching the clock in anticipation of lunchtime — is peppered with teasers for coming sequels. You may have heard a rumor that Wonder Woman shows up, or caught sight of her in a trailer for the film. And here she is, played by Gal Gadot. The character arrives in full, vintage costume a bit late (we’ve seen her in evening wear already), in time to join the climactic battle, which features a giant anthropomorphic slime monster and is a sludgy, noisy, chaotic mess. Even more than what has come before. The studio has, in the usual way, begged and bullied critics not to reveal plot points, and I wouldn’t dream of denying you the thrill of discovering just how overstuffed and preposterous a movie narrative can be. So I won’t say anything about the trip Lois Lane (Amy Adams) takes to Washington, or about the senator from Kentucky (Holly Hunter) who holds hearings there, or about Lois and Clark’s boss (Laurence Fishburne), except insofar as I am glad to acknowledge the professionalism of the supporting cast. Jesse Eisenberg, as a tech-twerpy Lex Luthor, certainly earned some money. I’d prefer to talk about the images and — so help me — the Themes. Intellectual pretension, long an occupational hazard in the superhero business, has been elevated to a creative principle. Christopher Nolan is partly to blame. His “Dark Knight” entries in the Batman saga raised the genre’s allegorical stakes and dialed down the humor to an all-but-imperceptible whisper. Still, Mr. Nolan’s filmmaking skill — above all the coherence of his inky, cruel vision of Gotham City and environs — enabled those movies to carry at least some of their self-assigned thematic weight. Mr. Snyder, for his part, deploys signifiers of importance without having anything much to say. Yes, there is a lot of talk (mostly stuffed into poor Mr. Eisenberg’s mouth) about Good and Evil and God and Man, and there is also a lot of religious symbolism. (Note the crucifixes dotting the landscape near the end.) There are murky shadows and muddy nightscapes, all redolent not just of ordinary danger but of metaphysical darkness. There is Mr. Affleck’s existential brooding and the stoic dimple on Mr. Cavill’s chin. For fun there are shots of the heroes shirtless and of Lois Lane in the bath. But the point of “Batman v Superman” isn’t fun, and it isn’t thinking, either. It’s obedience. The theology is invoked not to elicit meditations on mercy, justice or sacrifice, but to buttress a spectacle of power. And in that way the film serves as a metaphor for its own aspirations. The corporations that produce movies like this one, and the ambitious hacks who sign up to make them, have no evident motive beyond their own aggrandizement. Entertainment is less the goal than the byproduct, and as the commercial reach of superpower franchises grows, their creative exhaustion becomes ever more apparent. Not that anyone cares. (And yes, there are exceptions.) As long as we are paying attention, or at least buying tickets, the system is working to its own satisfaction. In “Batman v Superman,” the newspapers are full of controversy about the heroes, whom the fickle public alternately turns on and embraces. Batty and Supey themselves, meanwhile, perpetually mistake their narcissism for high-minded public service, and are encouraged to do so by the cynical and sanctimonious institutions that are nominally in charge of things in Gotham and Metropolis. The rest of the population — or the digitally created simulacra thereof — is required only to die en masse, to cower in terror, and to watch in wide-eyed, worshipful gratitude. That is just what this movie expects of you: acquiescence. It wants you to believe that it’s on your side. Don’t be fooled. “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Hints of sexuality and of extreme brutality are meant to make it seem daring and serious. Running time: 2 hours 31 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/movies/review-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-when-super-friends-fight.html
"‘The East,’ Written by Zal Batmanglij and Brit Marling - The New York Times","called “jams” — shade from prankish agitprop toward outright terrorism. The members of the group, who live off the grid in an abandoned house in the wilderness somewhere near the Mason-Dixon line, are determined to hold the poisoners and polluters of the executive class accountable for their actions. Sometimes, as in the case of a pharmaceutical company that has peddled dangerous antibiotics, this means giving the bosses a literal taste of their own medicine. Written by Zal Batmanglij and Brit Marling and directed by Mr. Batmanglij, “The East” follows Jane, an undercover operative for a private security-consulting firm, played by Ms. Marling, as she progresses from Dumpster diving and freight train hopping to the inner circle where the jams are planned. Jane, known to her new comrades as Sarah, is a former F. B. I. agent who reports back to her boss, a serenely chilly Patricia Clarkson. The parameters of Jane’s mission are not as clear as her almost instantly divided loyalty. Back home in Washington, Jane has a scruffy, sensitive, bland boyfriend. Out in the woods, she falls under the spell of Benji (Alexander Skarsgard), who is scruffy, sensitive and dangerous. While the East, being a group of anarchists, has no formal leader, Benji is clearly the alpha dog. His main lieutenants are an elfin zealot named Izzy (Ellen Page) and Doc (Toby Kebbell), a troubled former medical student. All of them come from relatively privileged backgrounds and have painful, intimate reasons for taking up the cause. In general, “The East” is a bit more persuasive on the psychology of its characters than on the politics of their actions. Ms. Marling is a sympathetic presence, in part because her slack-jawed, glassy-eyed passivity is an effective mirror of the audience’s ambivalence. She is initially appalled by Benji and his followers — by their hygiene as much as by their self-righteousness — but gradually finds comfort in the rough simplicity of their thrifty, communal approach to life. The world of work, stability and consumerism feels increasingly sterile and false to her. Mr. Batmanglij and the cinematographer, Roman Vasyanov, register this evolution with subtle visual cues, as the forest and the old dark house become less scary and more enchanted, and everywhere else is drained of color. Jane’s goodness is as axiomatic as that of a fairy tale princess. While we suspect that she will stray into morally dangerous territory, real evil seems beyond her capacities. In their previous collaboration — the cult film (in both senses) “Sound of My Voice” — Ms. Marling and Mr. Batmanglij played with her aura of guileless blond sweetness to haunting and troubling effect. “The East,” while more conventional in style and structure than that film (or “Another Earth,” which Ms. Marling also helped write and starred in), has some of its spookiness, a sense of ambient vulnerability that extends from the individuals on screen into the very universe they inhabit. This intimation of large, lurking danger is appropriate to this movie’s vague environmental theme. The damaged, idealistic young people plotting to terrorize the wealthy and comfortable are seen as canaries in the coal mine, their rage a sign that something is terribly wrong. But their animus is also explained in ways that strain credibility and undermine the film’s topicality. Benji, Izzy and Doc are motivated by grief, filial resentment and a desire for revenge. For them the political is personal, which makes it a little less urgent for everybody else. But it may be asking too much of “The East” — which is, after all, a twisty, breathless genre film — to wish that it would frame the contradictions of contemporary capitalism more rigorously. The movie is aware that they exist, and wishes that they could be resolved more or less happily, which is hard to argue with, though also hard to believe. “The East” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Restrained violence, sex and profanity.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/movies/the-east-written-by-zal-batmanglij-and-brit-marling.html
‘Sound of My Voice’ Directed by Zal Batmanglij - The New York Times,"where they shed their clothes and cleanse their bodies in a ritual — are opened up bit by bit, wound by wound, until they’re sobbing and laughing, their insides smeared across the carpet. The hooky story centers on a young couple, Peter (Christopher Denham) and Lorna (Nicole Vicius), who are clandestinely trying to make a documentary about an apparent cult. The movie opens abruptly, ominously, in the dead of night with the couple being driven — they switch vehicles at one point — to a house where a man instructs them to strip, shower and change into new clothes. (Peter has a tiny spy camera in his eyeglasses.) They do, methodically scrubbing their bodies, and then descend into a sparsely furnished basement. There 10 or so similarly dressed people are waiting for what they believe may be salvation in the ethereal form of a willowy young woman, Maggie (Brit Marling), who, in true star style, knows how to make an entrance: veiled and tethered to an oxygen tank. When Maggie sits down, the party begins in earnest. Without her veil and nasal prongs, dressed in light, loose garments, her long blond hair cascading down her back, she looks like any number of California girls, one of those pretty young women from Kansas or Iowa looking to break into the movies. Maggie is on a different journey, and while the detours and destination of her path are vague, she makes for a mesmerizing traveling companion — or, more rightly, guide. Because Maggie is the reason that Peter, Lorna and the rest are here, and she knows it, feeds on it. Talking in a soft voice she gives them exactly what they need: attention, hope, a break from the past, a bead on the future. Even as Peter and Lorna keep trying to make their film, they’re not immune to her. Is Maggie a Manson, a Madonna or perhaps something else entirely? That’s the question that the director Zal Batmanglij and Ms. Marling, who together wrote the script, keep teasingly open. Peter and Lorna are adamant that they already know the truth, at least before Maggie starts boring into their heads (much as the filmmakers try to do with us). Peter is particularly zealous, confusing belief with knowledge. Whether he can actually see what’s happening, inside the basement and out, plays into the movie’s ideas about the push-pull between reality and the world of appearances. In a nice touch, Peter makes a living as a schoolteacher, which suggests he isn’t exactly an innocent when it comes to indoctrination. From the start, when the word “one” slams on the screen, beginning a count that divides the story into 10 sections, Mr. Batmanglij gives the movie an appreciable air of unease. Like Peter and Lorna, you don’t know whether Maggie’s the real deal — though the better question is what type of deal she is offering. Is she a friend, foe, fool or just another La-La Land guru peddling transcendence? Ms. Marling, raising her voice only occasionally and keeping her gestures largely relaxed, makes restraint work for her, which fits the movie’s increasingly claustrophobic vibe. Maggie erupts only periodically, and when she does it’s always other people’s fault: They are withholding, cowardly. One moment she’s a caring therapist, the next an acting coach and then the personification of a superego. Mr. Batmanglij and Ms. Marling do better when they’re working through the material, especially in the basement sessions, then tying everything together, and their big finish, while pleasingly surprising, is the kind of tricky deus ex machina that needs better finessing. The movie’s ambitions are modest, but within its narrow parameters — with sets that look as if they cost about two bucks and grayish digital visuals that make you yearn for film — they create a plausible, recognizable world about characters engaged in that most fundamental search: for the meaning of life. Ms. Marling, who also starred in and was a writer on the recent independent feature, “Another Earth,” another low budget movie that intelligently made the most of its limited means, appears to be on her way to figuring out that question. “Sound of My Voice” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Holy Iceberg! Dynamic Duo Vs. Mr. Freeze - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from June 20, 1997, Section C, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. AT a gala in Gotham City, the fabulous Poison Ivy makes her entrance in a fluffy magenta gorilla suit made from 450 Santa Claus wigs. Then she peels this off slowly as the band plays her theme song. And out comes the most show-stopping character in ''Batman and Robin,'' the fourth and most frenetically gaudy feature in the series. As played by Uma Thurman, Poison Ivy is perfect, flaunting great looks, a mocking attitude and madly flamboyant disguises. Like Mae West, she mixes true femininity with the winking womanliness of a drag queen. Poison Ivy captures the essence of ''Batman and Robin,'' a wild, campy costume party of a movie and the first ''Batman'' to suggest that somewhere in Gotham City there might be a Studio 54. Joel Schumacher, director and ringmaster, piles on the flashy showmanship and keeps the film as big, bold, noisy and mindlessly overwhelming as possible. In this context, it's not surprising that even the opening credit sequence is at fever pitch. The movie begins with Batman and Robin caught up in a crazed hockey match, taking off on a rocket and then surfing through space. Aiming for comic book fans with a taste for heavy sarcasm and double-entendres, the lavish ''Batman and Robin'' cares only about delivering nonstop glitter. In the interests of this, it is more than happy to steamroll over questions of character and plotting. There's not much more to Batman, now played affably but blandly by George Clooney and given only second billing, than a heroic jaw line, understanding gaze and anatomically correct rubber suit. The mixed-up, melancholy Batman of Tim Burton's first two films looks like the brooding Prince of Denmark next to this. What ''Batman and Robin'' does deliver is outlandish visual mischief, and the more the merrier. The architecture of Gotham City now incorporates huge, hunky male statuary, and the local punks suggest ''A Clockwork Orange'' and heavy metal bands. Gotham throws a Save the Rainforest costume ball, complete with extras doing a Polynesian dance number. Mr. Freeze, the lumbering villain played by Arnold Schwarzenegger plus a 45-pound suit equipped with a couple of thousand tiny blue lights, is the occasion for crazy experiments in icy decor. Since ''Batman and Robin'' does its best to throw in something for everyone, there's even a dinosaur in one of these frosty scenes. Like ''Batman Forever,'' the new film was directed fancifully by Mr. Schumacher and written by Akiva Goldsman (one of several ''Batman'' writers last time). Like ''Batman'' characters, these two lead double lives: they also collaborated on two John Grisham adaptations, ''The Client'' and ''A Time to Kill,'' which concern real people experiencing life without benefit of special effects. In other words they're a lot smarter than, say, Mr. Freeze, whose deadliest weapon in the film is an arsenal of har-har puns. Like: ''I'm afraid my condition has left me cold to your pleas!'' And: ''You are not sending me to the cooler!''Mr. Schwarzenegger wears his armor manfully and delivers such lines with suitable smirks. And his Mr. Freeze is introduced as a former two-time Nobel Prize winner in molecular biology, which is surely the funniest thing in the movie. But the ''Batman'' formula now works best when the characters, like the filmmakers, can be tongue-in-cheek. Certainly the brilliantly costumed Ms. Thurman is teasing as she plays a mousy botanist who becomes a glorious Venus flytrap and green-rights advocate. ''The time has come for plants to take back the world so rightfully ours!'' she threatens, while also denouncing Batman and Robin. (''Militant arm of the warm-blooded oppressors! Animal protectors of the status quo!'')On the other hand, several of the film's characters conspicuously fail to find the fun in their roles. After all the irony on display in ''Clueless,'' Alicia Silverstone plays Batgirl dully straight. And Mr. Clooney, who does look ideal in the Batman outfit, is often seen listening thoughtfully, grinning ruefully and not knowing what to do next. The performance works well enough for the role's limited demands, but Mr. Clooney doesn't seem to believe that a suave, level-headed grown man might actually be Batman. Actually, you can't really blame him for that. While the film veers recklessly from neo-''Triumph of the Will'' to Hong Kong action to anything else the traffic will bear -- and that's just in the opening hockey match -- it trots out a lively supporting cast. Elle Macpherson, Vivica A. Fox and Vendela K. Thommessen supply window dressing in small roles, while John Glover flames amusingly as the mad scientist who gives Ivy her start. Michael Gough harrumphs heartwarmingly through the role of Alfred the incredibly patient butler, whose presence this time is milked to create a semblance of emotion. And Chris O'Donnell's Robin really deserves to have his name in the title, giving a much better performance as his much-improved Robin slyly comes into his own. ''I want a Robin signal in the sky, all right?'' he complains to Batman. ''I'm tired of living in your shadow!'' This time, Robin shows how to succeed in ''Batman'': playing it straight while getting the joke.''Batman and Robin'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes cartoonish violence, many coy innuendoes and fetish-ready rubber suits.

That discontinuity is the least of the many problems afflicting the movie, which opened locally on Christmas Day. Set in the 1940's, ""Mask of the Phantasm"" is a cartoon film noir evocation of events that purport to explain the origins of Batman. In convoluted flashbacks, it portrays a star-crossed love affair between Bruce Wayne, the reclusive millionaire who is Batman's alter ego and Andrea Beaumont, a beautiful banker's daughter who suggests a svelte hybrid of Lauren Bacall and Veronica Lake. After the violent deaths of Bruce's parents, Andrea's love enables him to give up his vow to avenge the killings. But when she abruptly breaks off their engagement and disappears with her father, the Caped Crusader is born out of the emptiness and disillusionment. In solving a series of murders of aging mobsters, Batman discovers that Andrea and her father are caught up in a web of international loansharking. The killer, with whom Batman does battle, is a sinister caped figure who looks so much like him that he finds himself a prime suspect. With its pointed, cavernous backgrounds and a Gotham City setting that evokes a 1940's-style futurism, ""Mask of the Phantasm"" looks splendid. But its story is too complicated and the editing too jerky for the movie to achieve narrative coherence. And the resemblance between the movie's hero and its enigmatic arch-villain is so close that audiences are likely to be confused. The actor's voices may suit animated television characters, but on a large screen Kevin Conroy's Batman, Mark Hamill's Joker, and Dana Delany's Andrea sound flat and one-dimensional. Shirley Walker's overblown score floods the movie with choral bombast that only points up an absence of anything remotely gripping. The movie is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

BATMAN"" was an exceptionally hard act to follow, and that's no compliment.

Yet the status of ""Batman"" as one of Hollywood's biggest commercial triumphs only compounded the sequel problem, creating pressure to re-activate this money machine at any cost. The prospect of a new ""Batman"" installment -- ""Batman Returns"" opens today at more than 2,600 theaters nationwide -- has thus been more inevitable than welcome. Under these circumstances, the director Tim Burton has wisely switched gears, re-inventing the mood and manner of ""Batman"" so fearlessly that he steps out of his own film's murky shadow. Mr. Burton's new ""Batman Returns"" is as sprightly as its predecessor was sluggish, and it succeeds in banishing much of the dourness and tedium that made the first film such an ordeal. Indeed, allowing for a ceiling on viewers' interest as to just what can transpire between cartoon characters like Batman and the Penguin, ""Batman Returns"" is often an unexpectedly droll creation. It stands as evidence that movie properties, like this story's enchantingly mixed-up Catwoman, really can have multiple lives. Drawing upon the fairy-tale spirit of his more freewheeling fables -- ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Beetlejuice,"" ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" -- Mr. Burton creates a wicked world of misfits, all of them rendered with the mixture of horror, sympathy and playfulness that has become this director's hallmark. More so than Jack Nicholson's mockingly vicious Joker in the earlier film, this story's miscreants have colorful clinical histories. So intensely does Mr. Burton render his villains' tender psyches, in fact, that the upright hero Bruce Wayne, a.k.a. Batman (Michael Keaton), is easily overlooked amid all the toys and troublemakers that surround him. This Batman, with motives and magical powers that are never made interesting, is at best a cipher and at worst a black hole. The blandness of Batman (through no fault of Mr. Keaton, who plays the character with appropriate earnestness) is symptomatic of this material's main shortcoming: almost nothing about it makes sense or particularly matters. Primarily a visual artist, Mr. Burton is often casual about plot considerations, which means that audiences watching his films are set adrift as if in dreams. And the characters' thoughts and motives are half-forgotten before the film is over. Costumes, attitudes, gadgets and the great ingenuity of Bo Welch's dazzling production design will linger in the mind long after the actual story of ""Batman Returns"" becomes a blur. Because the film's predominant motif is that of wounded individuals re-inventing themselves as wily villains, its most memorable episodes are early ones explaining each main character's transformation. Beginning wittily with the troubled infancy of the Penguin -- as parents, Diane Salinger and a monocled Paul Reubens are seen throwing their offspring into a sewer, where he floats away to grow up among the birds -- the film moves on to the beleaguered secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her own peculiar evolution. Mousy and lonely -- Selina habitually calls out ""Honey, I'm home,"" then reminds herself that she isn't married -- this secretary is treated contemptuously by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), a wealthy industrialist with the arrogance to throw uncooperative employees out windows. ""How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?"" Selina wails. But Max hurts her anyway, and only the efforts of a team of alley cats bring her back to life. Saved, like the Penguin, by the magic of the animal world, Selina metamorphoses thrillingly into Catwoman, in a sequence that ranks with the most captivating moments Ms. Pfeiffer has spent on screen. Fully inhabiting this vixenish character, she turns Catwoman into a fierce, seductive embodiment of her earlier dissatisfaction. ""Life's a bitch,"" she slyly declares. ""Now so am I.""Systematically destroying her past, Selina smashes the bric-a-brac, demolishes the dollhouse and spray-paints the cute clothes, emerging from the ruins of her earlier life as a wonderfully sultry and diffident creature in a skin-tight, gleaming black wetsuit. There will be viewers drawn to ""Batman Returns"" largely for the chance of watching Ms. Pfeiffer strike this pose, and they won't be sorry. But there is at least as much personality to the performance as there is visual appeal, as evidenced by the bored, feline drawl with which she delivers her best lines. ""Oh, please,"" she yawns later, when propositioned by the eager, Humpty Dumpty-shaped Penguin (Danny DeVito). ""I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.""""Batman Returns"" is at its best in this introductory stage, and in the halting courtship that develops between Batman and Catwoman when they aren't matching wits in black battle regalia. It is weakest in a long, drawn-out finale that only emphasizes Mr. Burton's relative lack of interest in ordinary action sequences. This ending will make audiences wish it were not a Hollywood truism that films as expensive and ambitious as ""Batman Returns"" need be more than two hours long. Mr. Welch's production design, which is much sleeker and brighter than the brooding, oppressive look Anton Furst created for the earlier film, is only one of the behind-the-scenes contributions that have set this Batman saga on a different course. Stefan Czapsky's crisp cinematography gives a lively look even to the film's subterranean settings, and does a lot to keep the Felliniesque clown extras (one of Mr. Burton's needless excesses) from lapsing into the grotesque. And Daniel Waters, who wrote ""Heathers,"" gives this screenplay a sharper edge than the earlier film's string of dull taunts and insults. ""They wouldn't put me on a pedestal, so I'm laying 'em on a slab!"" declares the fiendish Penguin, after Max Shreck's attempts to make him Mayor of Gotham City have gone awry. ""Not a lot of reflective surfaces down in the sewer, huh?"" asks an image consultant assigned to the Penguin's campaign, at which the Penguin tries to bite off his nose. Mr. DeVito deserves particular credit for conveying verve through the Penguin's feature-obscuring makeup, and for managing to seem charming even when drooling black ink. Mr. Walken, wonderfully debonair, would have been villain enough for any story, and is certainly one of the bright spots of this one. ""I don't know what you want,"" this smooth businessman declares when he meets a mortal enemy, ""but I know that I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.""""Batman Returns"" includes enough trickery to attract children's interest. But a cartoonish spirit and a taste for toys do not make it a children's film. Parents should take into account the film's nightmarish setting, its characters' mean-spirited sparring and the fact that children are abandoned, kidnapped and threatened with murder during the course of the story.""Batman Returns"" is rated PG-13 (Parents srtongly cautioned). That merely reflects its dialogue, which prefers double-entendres to actual profanity, and its occasionally ugly violence.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.''Batman'' begins with a lot of promise: the camera pans across dark, lowering clouds as we hear music so doomy you might think it to be Mahler, though it's really Prince in a cosmic mode. Gotham City swims slowly into focus. It's a production designer's coup de cinema, a nightmare version of megalopolis, an urban landscape without sun, seen through a smog of pollutants and despair. Everything seems foreshortened, squeezed, angry and rotten. If, like Dorian Gray, Manhattan has a portrait stashed away in an attic, this is how it would look. Every crime from purse-snatching to multi-million-dollar payoffs is recorded in this mess of out-of-date facades, hideous bunkerlike new buildings, exposed girders and disintegrating brick. Anton Furst's production design is so evocative that one expects to meet a fiend on the order of Dr. Mabuse, Fritz Lang's master criminal, rather than D. C. Comics' Joker, who, though brilliantly played by Jack Nicholson, simply isn't up to the apocalyptic grandeur of the decor. This is also pretty much the problem of ''Batman,'' which opens today at the Cinema 1 and other theaters. Don't be conned by the film's funny, breathlessly paced trailer that's been showing for the last few months. The feature is something else. It's an elaborate, shapeless, big-screen reincarnation of the 50-year-old comic-book character. Bruce Wayne is, by day, Gotham City's enigmatic millionaire-about-town. By night, done up in the drag of someone with a possibly dangerous leather fetish, he is the mysterious Batman, defender of the righteous and implacable foe of all evil. Jon Peters and Peter Guber, the producers, and their army of employees, including Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren, who wrote the screenplay, and Tim Burton, the director, have elected to avoid the camp style that made the ''Batman'' television series so popular 20 years ago. Instead, they treat the material with a kind of Langian intensity that has no point. It's just there. Thanks to the work of Mr. Furst, ''Batman'' is fun to look at, at least for a while. Not since Lang's ''Dr. Mabuse: the Gambler'' (1922), ''Metropolis'' (1926) and ''The Last Will of Dr. Mabuse'' (1933) have so much talent and money gone into the creation of an expressionistic world so determinedly corrupt. Yet nothing in the movie sustains this vision. The wit is all pictorial. The film meanders mindlessly from one image to the next, as does a comic book. It doesn't help that the title character remains such a wimp even when played by Michael Keaton. Nobody could do anything with this ridiculous conceit, but asking Mr. Keaton, one of our most volatile actors, to play Bruce Wayne/Batman is like asking him to put on an ape suit and play the title role in ''King Kong.''Most of the time all we can see of him behind his bat mask are his eyes, the tip of his nose and his chin. Everything else is encased in the kind of outfit one might rent for a Halloween party. As Bruce Wayne, Mr. Keaton is modest and straight-faced, as any number of other actors might be given the circumstances and the paycheck. Mr. Nicholson has more fun as the wicked Joker. He is a small-time thief who becomes Gotham City's star criminal after falling into a vat of terrible goo that leaves his face clown-white, his mouth lifted up into a permanent clown-grin. Mr. Nicholson pops his eyes, sneers, laughs maniacally and, in the film's liveliest sequence, sings and dances his way through the Gotham City museum of art, happily defacing the paintings. He also has the film's only funny lines (''I'm the world's first fully functional homicidal artist''), and often sounds more than a little like Liberace. The only other members of the cast to make any impression are Michael Gough, who plays Jeeves to Bruce Wayne's pallid Bertie Wooster, and Kim Basinger, who adds a little welcome heat to the movie as the photographer with whom Bruce spends one night of love. Comic ideas waft through the movie like phantoms hoping to take shape. The writers introduce the idea that Gotham City has run out of money with which to celebrate its bicentennial, the result of terrible fiscal mismanagement, but nothing is really made of it. At one point the Joker turns Gotham City into ''a shopper's nightmare'' by randomly poisoning cosmetics. Victims die a ghastly death with the Joker's grin affixed to their faces. Mostly, though, ''Batman'' is a movie without any dominant tone or style other than that provided by Mr. Furst. It's neither funny nor solemn. It has the personality not of a particular movie but of a product, of something arrived at by corporate decision.''Batman,'' which has been rated PG-13 (''Special Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13''), has some scenes of violence.

Review: ‘Beauty and the Beast’ Revels in Joy and Enchantment - The New York Times,"to use the grim business nomenclature of Hollywood — often leads to hack work and zombie-ism, as old archetypes are shocked to life and arrayed in garish, synthetic modern effects. That might easily have happened here. Look (I mean: don’t look) at the horrors that have been visited, in recent years, on Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz. And even if Disney had done a more convincing upgrade, on the model of last year’s “Jungle Book,” a new “Beauty” could have offended fans of the 1991 animated feature simply by existing. That movie, a high point of the ’80s and ’90s Disney revival, is close to perfect. What singing teapot would dare to challenge Angela Lansbury?The only possible answer is Emma Thompson, whose Mrs. Potts is joined by other household objects with the voices (and, briefly, the faces) of movie stars. Stanley Tucci and Audra McDonald are the excitable harpsichord and the operatic wardrobe; Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen are the suave candelabra and the anxious clock. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is the lissome feather duster. Young Nathan Mack is Chip, Mrs. Potts’s son. Their singing and banter is so vivid and so natural that you almost take for granted that they appear to be mechanical objects clicking and whirling in physical space, sharing the frame with human characters. There are a few moments — a climactic high-elevation fight scene that looks like every other climactic high-elevation fight scene; a chase through the forest involving wolves — where the digital seams show, and you’re aware of the cold presence of lines of code behind the images. Most of the time, though, you are happily fooled. More than that: enchanted. The most dazzling visual flights are matched to the best of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken’s songs. “Be Our Guest” in particular is a choreographic extravaganza that enfolds decades of Disney history (all the way back to “Snow White” and “Fantasia”) in contemporary cinematic craft. But the tradition of Disney features, both live action and animated, rigorously places spectacle in the service of plot. The audience needs to be, by turns, reassured and surprised, guided through startling and suspenseful events toward a never-in-doubt conclusion. The new “Beauty and the Beast,” written by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos, smoothly modernizes — and to some degree sanitizes — a story with a potentially thorny psychosexual subtext, a tale of male animality and female captivity. He’s a beast and a prince. She’s his prisoner and his therapist. It’s a little kinky if you stop to think about it, and also (to use a more responsible word) a little problematic. Variations on the beauty-beast theme are hardly scarce. What else is “Twilight” (the last two movie installments were directed by Mr. Condon)? Or “Fifty Shades of Grey”? “Beauty and the Beast” decisively removes itself from such company by insisting on the heroism and competence of its heroine, Belle, a bookish and ingenious young woman who lives with her father (Kevin Kline) in a picture-book French village. Ms. Watson, already something of a feminist pioneer thanks to her portrayal of Hermione Granger in the “Harry Potter” movies, perfectly embodies Belle’s compassion and intelligence. Mr. Stevens, blandly handsome as a human prince, is a splendid monster, especially when the diffidence and charm start to peek through the rage. The awkward business about imprisonment turning into true love is handled smoothly. If you want a hot and haunting “Beauty and the Beast,” check out Jean Cocteau’s version, or the fan-fiction-inspiring television show from the 1980s. This one is chaste and charming. It’s Disney! Which means there will also be a villain and a comical sidekick, who steal many scenes on the way to their comeuppance. That would be Gaston (Luke Evans), a narcissistic cabbage-stomping former soldier and his adoring pal LeFou (Josh Gad). Gaston is sweet on Belle, and his excitement at her unambiguous refusals makes him the film’s avatar of nastiness. No redemption here. He goes from annoying to evil when he stirs up the anti-intellectualism and xenophobia of a populist mob to serve his own egomaniacal ends. The residents of the castle fight back because their humanity is at stake. It’s just a fairy tale.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/movies/beauty-and-the-beast-review.html

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Two years ago Walt Disney Pictures reinvented the animated feature, not only with an eye toward pleasing children but also with an older, savvier audience in mind. Disney truly bridged a generation gap with ""The Little Mermaid,"" bringing the genre new sophistication without sacrificing any of the delight. It's not surprising that an attempt has been made to replicate that success with ""Beauty and the Beast,"" a film that takes a similar view of its audience and transfers some of the earlier film's most inspired staging ideas from an underwater setting to 18th-century France. But it is a surprise, in a time of sequels and retreads, that the new film is so fresh and altogether triumphant in its own right. Lightning has definitely struck twice. With ""Beauty and the Beast,"" a tender, seamless and even more ambitious film than its predecessor, Disney has done something no one has done before: combine the latest computer animation techniques with the best of Broadway. Here, in the guise of furthering a children's fable, is the brand of witty, soaring musical score that is now virtually extinct on the stage. ""The Little Mermaid"" was similarly a showcase for the extraordinary songwriting talents of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, but this time the music is even more central. Broadway is as vital to this film's staging and characterizations as it is to the songs themselves. Since ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a work of Disney animation, it also has its own traditions and its own purview. No live-action musical could ever match the miracles of anthropomorphism that occur here, or the fantastically sweeping scale. Nor could a live-action work achieve this mixture of elaborate, painstaking technique and perfect simplicity. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is filled with affectionate homages to the live-action sources that have inspired it, and indeed those influences are strong. But its overriding spirit is all its own. If this ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a long way from Jean Cocteau's 1947 black-and-white version, it's also a long way from the original fairy tale, which has been largely jettisoned in favor of a more timely story. This film's Beauty, called Belle, is the smartest, best-read person in a small provincial French town. As such, she is hotly pursued by Gaston, the lantern-jawed he-man who is initially the butt of the film's jokes and later becomes its villain. ""The most beautiful girl in town,"" Gaston decides about Belle, in his booming bass tones. ""That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best?"" Thoughts like that make ""Beauty and the Beast"" an amusingly clear product of its time. Wandering through her village while reading a book, Belle becomes the focus of a spectacular opening number that captures the essence of this film's appeal. Bit by bit, the population trickles out to greet Belle and gossip about her, while she herself bemoans the small-mindedness of the place. This rousing number reaches such a flurry of musical counterpoint that it recalls sources as unlikely as ""West Side Story,"" while the direction builds energetically from quiet beginnings to a formidable finale. The directors, Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, have been plucked out of relative obscurity (i.e. a short film shown at Epcot Center) in one of many remarkable casting coups here, and they acquit themselves beautifully. So does Robby Benson, the actor chosen out of far left field to provide the voice of the Beast. Mr. Benson's usually soft timbre has been so altered and amplified (by the growls of real panthers and lions) that it is virtually unrecognizable, but a crucial hint of gentleness remains. And his vocal performance, as an initially surly and frightening Beast who must be tamed by his household bric-a-brac before he can win Belle's love, is so convincing that it eradicates all memory of his mild manner. That bric-a-brac, enchantingly cast and conceived, includes Angela Lansbury as the voice of Mrs. Potts, a kindly teapot and the mother of a snub-nosed little cup named Chip (Bradley Michael Pierce); Jerry Orbach as the surprisingly Chevalier-like voice of Lumiere, a debonair candelabrum; David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth, a proper English clock, and a footstool that wags its tassels and barks like a dog. All of these inventions, along with others like a dust mop with the cap and beauty mark of a French chambermaid, join forces to define the film's idea of magic, especially when at last the objects' true natures are revealed.""Be Our Guest,"" the lavish production number that is a dry-land answer to ""Under the Sea"" from ""The Little Mermaid,"" may not have the identical calypso charm, but it has just about everything else, including Busby Berkeley-style choreography carried out by dancing silverware. The jaunty Lumiere sings:Soup du jour, hot hors d'ouevresWhy, we only live to serveTry the gray stuff, it's deliciousDon't believe me? Ask the dishes!This demonstrates Mr. Ashman's gifts as an outstandingly nimble lyricist. His death from AIDS in March at age 40 cut short a brilliant career, but the jubilant energy of his work will long live on. Because of its wider ambitions, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is less intent on sweetness than on making its story's central point (which is slightly undercut when the Beast is ultimately revealed to be a paragon of bland handsomeness beneath his glowering exterior). It is more darkly forbidding and at times more violent than the average animated children's fable. But it also has more to say. Belle's intelligence and bravery are as well conveyed as the fatuousness beneath Gaston's handsome exterior, all of which gives the story a modern flavor. Paige O'Hara and Richard White, supplying the voices, do wonders in bringing Belle and Gaston to life. Gaston is the subject of another outstanding song, a musical lambasting to a tune vaguely reminiscent of ""Captain Hook,"" from ""Peter Pan."" Mr. Menken's melodies, always buoyant and captivating, are familiar only in a way that bespeaks good sense and great taste. By far the songwriters' biggest triumph is the title song, which becomes even more impressive in view of the not-very-promising assignment to create a ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme song. But the result is a glorious ballad, one that is performed in two versions, as both a top-40 style duet heard over the closing credits and a sweet, lilting solo sung by Ms. Lansbury during the film's most meltingly lovely scene. For the latter, which also shows off the film's dynamic use of computer-generated animation, the viewer would be well advised to bring a hanky. And Mr. Menken should make room on the shelf where he keeps his Oscars.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The oft-tried but seldom-known accomplishment of telling a familiar fairy-tale with pure imagery and enchantment through the sensuous devices of the screen has been almost perfectly realized by the French poet-playwright, Jean Cocteau, in his beautifully measured French production of the old fable, ""Beauty and the Beast."" Except that it isn't in color, this film which came to the Bijou yesterday is an eminent model of cinema achievement in the realm of poetic fantasy. This should be understood, however: the achievement is on a definitely adult plane and the beauties of Cocteau's conception will be most appreciated by sophisticated minds. It is not the sort of picture that will send the children into transports of delight, unless they are quite precocious youngsters of the new progressive school. For Cocteau has taken the old story of the beautiful country girl who goes to live as a hostage for her impoverished father in the palace of a terrifying beast, there to be treated with such kindness that she falls in love with the unhappy brute, and has used it as a pattern for weaving a priceless fabric of subtle images. In the style of his ""Blood of a Poet,"" though less abstract and recondite, it is a fabric of gorgeous visual metaphors, of undulating movements and rhythmic pace, of hypnotic sounds and music, of casually congealing ideas. Freudian or metaphysician, you can take from it what you will. The concepts are so ingenious that they're probably apt to any rationale. From the long corridor of candelabra, held out from the walls by living arms, through which the wondering visitor enters the palace of the Beast, to the glittering temple of Diana, wherein the mystery of the Beast is revealed, the visual progression of the fable into a dream-world casts its unpredictable spell. The dialogue, in French, is spare and simple, with the story largely told in pantomime, and the music of Georges Auric accompanies the dreamy, fitful moods. The settings are likewise expressive, many of the exteriors having been filmed for rare architectural vignettes at Raray, one of the most beautiful palaces and parks in all France. And the costumes, too, by Christian Berard and Escoffier, are exquisite affairs, glittering and imaginative, lacking only the glow of color, as we say. As the Beast (and also as the Young Prince and as the churlish suitor of the heroine), Jean Marais has the grace of a dancer, the voice of a muffled baritone. Although his grossly feline make-up is reminiscent of some of the monsters of Hollywood (and could drive the little kiddies to hysterics), he wears it exceedingly well. And as Beauty, Josette Day is truly lovely, youthful and delicate, a convincingly innocent maiden and student to the mysteries of life. Mila Parely is despicably vain and greedy as one of Beauty's bad sisters and Marcel Andre is nicely theatrical as her doting, ineffectual papa. Studied or not for philosophy, this is a sensuously fascinating film, a fanciful poem in movement given full articulation on the screen.

FILM REVIEW; How Many Actors Does It Take to Make a Log Talk? - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from December 26, 2002, Section E, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Miramax seems to be showing the same faith in Roberto Benigni's ''Pinocchio'' that the Republican Party showed in Trent Lott; the live-action version of Carlo Collodi's fairy tale about the wooden puppet whose only ambition was to be a real live boy was sneaked into theaters Christmas Day. A recent -- very recent -- decision to have an American actor, Breckin Meyer, voice the lead instead of Mr. Benigni, who also stars as Pinocchio and was co-writer of the screenplay, leaves you with the impression that Mr. Meyer was actually in the projection booth reading the script. That might account for the quality of the voice-overs, which are so sloppy you might feel as if you're watching a 1978 Hong Kong action picture: the dubbed mouths of the Italian cast are probably still moving an hour after the film is over. There must have been such a rush to get the prints into theaters for the nationwide opening that no one bothered to check the lip-syncing. It's as if someone tried to hit a target with a can of paint. In this enchanted setting, ''a land where grown-ups can act like children,'' a magic log falls off a cart and disrupts an entire tiny town. It bounces into Geppetto's home-workshop, and he quickly says, ''You can be like the son I never had'' as he carves into it his idea of a little boy. I guess Geppetto doesn't get out much, because his idea of a child is a 40-ish man with a receding hairline, pancake makeup and 5 o'clock shadow: the Pinocchio he fashions is Mr. Benigni. (It's particularly galling as Pinocchio makes fun of Geppetto's blond hairpiece, which looks like the thatched roof of a hut.) ''You're made out of pine; I'll call you Pinocchio,'' Geppetto says, struggling to get a word in over Pinocchio's constant bleating. This movie is also a chunk of pine, but it's still awaiting the magic touch to transmute it into a real live movie. ''Pinocchio'' opens with the Blue Fairy (played by Nicoletta Braschi, voiced by Glenn Close) coming into a small town, riding a carriage pulled by a train of little white mice: an undulating river of full-moon-colored fur towing her along. It's one of the few splashes of wonderment -- courtesy of the cinematographer, Dante Spinotti, and the production designer-magician, Danilo Donati -- in a picture that is mostly a desert of strangeness, a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes ''Battleship Earth'' and ''Showgirls.'' The heavy sighs of the few other people in the theater, who apparently had been paroled into the custody of the multiplex, were easily heard over the long, dead silences between Pinocchio-Benigni's chattering. Geppetto encourages Pinocchio to go to school, but he's not interested. When he is visited by a talking insect named Cricket (voice of John Cleese), who must have danced over from the magical land of copyright infringement, Pinocchio blathers, ''One job I want: the job of eating, drinking and playing.''Cricket scolds Pinocchio so often with ''Serves you right'' over his misbehaving that the little creature begins to sound like a rehab counselor. The Blue Fairy keeps an eye on Pinocchio, listening to his promises to be good. He always lets her down, and she keeps coming back; the subtitle should be ''When Good Fairies Love Bad Puppets.''Geppetto is a sucker for Pinocchio's word much longer than he should be, too, though their relationship is more obviously informed by delusion. It's hard to tell what's sadder, Geppetto's belief that Pinocchio is a child puppet or Mr. Benigni's need to play one. When he affectionately smooches Geppetto's face, it's like Jack playing out one of his outré fantasies on ''Will and Grace.''Other scenes of unintentional innuendo can be found. While Pinocchio is pulling one of his many jail stretches for a crime he didn't commit -- he spends more time in manacles that Enron's senior executives -- one of his cellmates, another adult under the illusion that he's a boy, offers a lick of a lollipop that's ''the flavor of paradise.'' How did this movie get past the Motion Picture Association?Mr. Benigni's decision makes this ''Pinocchio'' as believable as Diana Ross playing Dorothy in ''The Wiz'' or Matthew McConaughey portraying a college graduate in ''Contact.'' The movie does follow Collodi's sweeping ebb and flow closely. Occasionally the inflation works well. The whale that swallows Pinocchio and Geppetto whole is now a great white shark. And when Pinocchio is swindled into joining a pack of party boys and is turned into a donkey, the scene in which he becomes a circus beast of burden borders on touching. That is, it would if there had been an actress other than Ms. Braschi, with her Mona Lisa inexpressiveness, watching the affair. (With her blue-gelatin hair, she looks like an older version of post-punker Siouxsie, from the Banshees.)It's an oddity that will be avoided by millions of people, this new ''Pinocchio.'' Osama bin Laden could attend a showing in Times Square and be confident of remaining hidden.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Anyone who competes with a classic has to take the consequences. So it must be said at the outset that ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" suffers by comparison to the 1940 Walt Disney ""Pinocchio,"" based on the same enduring novel by Carlo Collodi. The new version, directed by Steve Barron, whose credits include ""Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" surely has its charms. But for all the effort that clearly went into its production, and despite the interesting differences between the latest ""Pinocchio,"" which mixes animated and live characters, and the wholly animated Disney version, the new film simply doesn't generate much magical enchantment. In ""The Adventures of Pinocchio,"" Martin Landau portrays Geppetto, the old woodcarver who returns one day from the forest with a load that includes a section of a tree in which, as a shy youth, he inscribed a heart, enclosing his initial beside that of his beloved, Leona, who married his brother.""Miracles are made in the heart,"" the voice of Pepe the Cricket chirps at the outset, and that special tree is indeed enchanted, so enchanted that when Geppetto tosses the log onto his fire, it jumps out, prompting him to carve it into the puppet figure of a little boy. Thanks to the skills of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, this Pinocchio is soon on the loose, first dazzling Geppetto, then vexing him with his boyish mischief, growing a long nose in school with his lies and attracting the attention of the opportunistic schemers Volpe and Felinet and, even worse, of the covetous impresario Lorenzini. When Pinocchio wreaks havoc in the local pastry shop, poor Geppetto must stand trial for the damages and, facing prison, he agrees to let Lorenzini pay his penalties in exchange for his dear Pinocchio. Before long, Pinocchio has rescued his fellow puppets from fiery peril in Lorenzini's show and is on the run, when he encounters his old schoolmate Lampwick, one of the many boys aboard a coach bound for that anarchic magic land where foolish runaways become jackasses. But with the help of Pepe, Pinocchio manages to save himself and his comrades, while Lorenzini is transformed into a monstrous leviathan by the same waters that make the boys into jackasses. So when Pinocchio learns from Leona that Geppetto has rowed out to sea in search of him, the stage is set for the showdown that pits puppet against sea monster and establishes the love and virtue that qualify Pinocchio to become a real boy. Mr. Landau makes an earnest Geppetto. Genevieve Bujold, as the widow Leona, is, as always, a charmer. Bebe Neuwirth as Felinet, Rob Schneider as Volpe and Udo Keir as Lorenzini create vivid villains. But audiences raised on the 1940 ""Pinocchio"" are likely to find Pepe the Cricket too archly modern and to miss the lovely score that accompanied the action in the extraordinary world created by Disney artists.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. DISNEY animation reached its pinnacle with ''Pinocchio,'' and that film's finest moment is the scene in Geppetto's workshop when every single toy springs gloriously to life. In the new film ''Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night,'' by comparison, the toys in the workshop don't bother to move, and only one token tweety-bird flutters in the foreground. This is Saturday morning animation at best, and if presented as such it wouldn't seem worse than ordinary. But as a spinoff of the real ''Pinocchio,'' to which it has virtually no connection (though the author Carlo Collodi gets an ''inspired by'' credit), it amounts to a form of bait and switch. Although ''Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night,'' which opens today at the Criterion Center and other theaters, has a celebrity-filled cast -including Edward Asner, Don Knotts, Tom Bosley and James Earl Jones -you'd have to look at the credits to notice this star power. The voices are no more distinguished than the material, which has Pinocchio venturing near a sinister carnival and making friends with a number of brightly colored bugs. He also fixes his attention on a little wooden girl named Twinkle, who sings a cloying song. But the animation is so poor that it's difficult to tell who is a puppet, and who is not. There are some sadly up-to-the-minute touches to ''Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night,'' not the least of them the fact that the 80's version of this once-childlike character now dreams of becoming a star. The direction, by Hal Sutherland, is also much more intrusive than the direction of the original film ever was; the camera frequently pans across static landscapes to compensate for what was once the animators' art. And now that Pinocchio has become a real boy, his fairy godmother, played by Rickie Lee Jones (who at least has a chance to sing), actually threatens him: ''Don't forget, Pinocchio, if you take your freedom for granted you might lose it. You might even turn into a puppet again.'' As dirty tricks go, they just don't get any dirtier.

"THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; 'Pinocchio,' Walt Disney's Long-Awaited Successor to 'Snow White,' Has Its Premiere at the Center Theatre--Other New Films - The New York Times","Jiminy Cricket to Mr. Disney's fantastic crew—and there were adventures with a cruel puppetmaster, encounters with a wicked Fox and a Cat, a bewitched sojourn on Pleasure Island, where wayward little boys turned into jackasses, and, finally, an exciting descent to the ocean's floor to rescue poor Gépetto from the belly of a whale. All grist, obviously, to the Disney mill. And he has had an impish, a scampish, a quizzical and disarmingly whimsical time with it from the moment his Jiminy Cricket (who acts as a debonair tourist guide through this wonderland) opens the pages of his fantasy to that, at the very end, when Figaro, the kitten, jumps into the goldfish bowl to plant an ecstatic and suspiciously fishy kiss on the cupid's-bow lips of Cleo, the kittenish goldfish. For all these curious folk and all their curious adventures have been drawn with Mr. Disney's invariably quick eye to amusing characterization and humorous detail, with his usual relish for a sly little joke, with his habitual enjoyment of telling whoppers and making them seem just as natural as a cricket in spats. His Jiminy Cricket, as you might have guessed, is the Dopey of ""Pinocchio,"" and for just the opposite reasons. He's smart as a cricket and twice as chirpy. It's something to hear him rap with his cane on the teeth of Monstro the Whale and demand admittance into the Blue Grottoed belly where Gepetto, perched on the rail of a swallowed derelict, is manfully fishing for tuna. It's something, too, to see the expression of annoyance drift across his face, glacier-like, when Gepetto's clocks begin to hammer out the seconds he meant to pass in sleep. ""Quiet!"" he bellows, like an assistant director, and every pendulum freezes in mid-swing. No question about it, Jiminy Cricket has a commanding presence and the droll voice of Cliff Edwards, who can burlesque a tenor with the worst of them. But it isn't easy to call Jiminy the only favorite. Pinocchio is a fresh little cuss, Cleo the Goldfish is a dream and Figaro the kitten is the kind of kitten only Disney's men could draw, exact to the whistling purr, the wicked side-glance, the bewildered and hurt look when the hand that has been scratching its neck suddenly is withdrawn. You'll like Mr. Disney's cast, from cricket to Monstro, from kitten to Fox, from Gepetto to goldfish. Technically, and we hate to be technical at a time like this, it answers every one of the objections raised when ""Snow White"" was shown. The drawing is finer, with none of the line-straying noticeable when Prince Charming and his Cinderella took the screen. The handling of shadows and highlights is surer, and the color-lovely as it was in Disney's first cartoon feature—is immeasurably lovelier here. We note, too, with vast admiration, evidences of true direction—freer use of camera in panning, zoom shot and dollying, so that the vantage point is not fixed but travels to and from and with the subjects in its range. Some uses of it are cute, too—like the camera's hopping toward a scene when little Jiminy is telling us how he hopped over to take a look in Gepetto's window. But that's enough about technique. Its refinement was inevitable, for Mr. Disney is a notorious perfectionist; we've no doubt he is dissatisfied still and will have even greater marvels for us in his ""Fantasia,"" the next of his promised features. What really matters, and all that matters, this morning is that ""Pinocchio"" is here at last, is every bit as fine as we had prayed it would be—if not finer—and that it is as gay and clever and delightful a fantasy as any well-behaved youngster or jaded oldster could hope to see. PINOCCHIO, a feature-length cartoon adapted from Collodi's fantasy; screen play by Ted Sears, Webb Smith, Joseph Sabo, Otto Englander, William Cottrell, Erdman Penner and Aurelius Battaglia; supervising directors Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske; sequence directors Bill Roberts, Jack Kinney, Norman Ferguson Wilfred Jackson and T. Hee; animation directors Fred Moore, Milton Kahl, Ward Kimball, Eric Larson, Franklin Thomas, Vladimir Tytla, Arthur Babbitt and Woolie Reitherman; character designs by Joe Grant, Albert Hurter, Campbell Grant, John P. Miller, Martin Provensen and John Walbridge; music and lyrics by Leigh Harline, Ned Washington and Paul J. Smith; art director, Charles Philippi; a Walt Disney production; released by RKO Radio Pictures. At the Center Theatre.

Worthington Foulfellow, the foxGideon, the punch-drunk catStromboli, the puppetmasterThe Blue FairyLampwick, the bad boyMonstro, the whaleThe CoachmanIf you don't know what all the shooting's about at the Paramount this week, we'll tell you; it's the United States Army under old General Ralph Morgan alternately chasing and being chased by an Injun varmint called Geronimo. And in spite of all the chasing, neither the redskins nor the white folks manage to run down a plot suitable for sustaining interest over the requisite feature-length period. To do them justice both sides beat manfully about a number of promising plot bushes, but the only semblance of actual plot uncovered by this furious activity are bits of baggage and old blank cartridges left over from Cecil De Mille's ""The Plainsman"" and John Ford's ""Stagecoach,"" which passed this way with considerably more dash and distinction than ""Geronimo"" seems able to muster. All this is not intended as a reflection on Geronimo himself, who is a remarkably genuine redskin with a vocabulary of one grunt and a histrionic repertoire of two expressions: grim, and very grim. Whether or not Geronimo's role is even a ""speaking role"" within the narrow limits laid down by the Screen Actors' Guild contract is something which would have to be determined by the delicate legal machinery of that organization. Our own vote would be in the negative—not because we wish to deprive Chief Thunder Cloud of the additional union wage, but simply because we doubt that there is even an Indian language in which so much hard service is demanded of a single monosyllable. Other members of the cast, however, more than make up for the Chief's deficiency of dialogue. Preston Foster, as the heroic and self-effacing Captain Starrett, talks a blue streak whenever he can get any member of the post, officer or private, to relax discipline long enough to listen to him. Andy Devine, the ill-groomed scout, whose quinsy persists, not only talks continually in barracks, but waxes as philosophical, as if he had been written by William Saroyan. Gene Lockhart, as the frontier rat who supplies repeating rifles to the redskins, not only talks, but guiltily sweats when they've finally cornered him. And there is quite a lengthy cast, including several unpioneer-looking women in the background whose principal difficulty seems to be that they can't get a word in edgewise. On the whole you may be grateful for the taciturnity of good old Geronimo before the picture's over. At the ParamountGERONIMO, screen play by Paul H.

Cecil KelloggWhen somebody got the happy notion of setting a hard-bitten, wise-cracking vaudeville performer like Metro's Maisie Ravier down in the heart of darkest Africa with only a satchel full of props between her and a bubbling kettle, the fat was already in the fire for a pleasing twist on the familiar tom-tom-and-witchcraft story. And that, in an unpretentious way, is what ""Congo Maisie,"" now at Loew's Criterion, offers. This Maisie, as those who saw her in an earlier adventure may recall, is a spitfire with a heart of gold—a combination of Pollyanna and a cleaned-up Sadie Thompson whose specialty act is magic and feats of sleight-of-hand. Thus, when a hoofer's luck strands her in an isolated medical station far up the Congo River, it is natural that she should go into her act in more ways than one. She assists in an emergency appendectomy, persuades a homesick wife not to run out on her doctor husband for a romancing rubber planter, argues the rubber planter into resuming a neglected medical Career and finally falls for the handsome dog herself. Apparently such things happen often in the Hollywood jungle. But the real fun comes when Maisie, gowned in a black sequin dress, turns off the inevitable attack of the angry natives, aroused by the witch-doctors, by giving them the old carnival spieler's line, ""Hurry, hurry, hurry!"" and a running exhibition of hankie tricks. Credit for her final feat, which is the sudden fabrication of rain, must go, however, to a desperate scenarist, not to her. In his direction, H. C. Potter has followed a fine line between solemnity and farce. You can literally take your pick. And Ann Sothern, well heeled with gags, plays the bedizened Maisie with just enough flounce and impudence to keep her fixit role from going gummy. Altogether this corner sees it as a nice bit of harmless fun. At Loew's CriterionCONGO MAISIE, screen play by Mary McCall Jr., based on the book ""Congo Landing,"" by Wilson Collison; directed by H.

But isn't there room in the time capsule for ''Pretty Woman,'' the romantic comedy about a lovelorn corporate raider and a sweet, wholesome streetwalker from Hollywood Boulevard? This one truly deserves a place. It is something special.''Pretty Woman'' is the story of Edward Lewis (Richard Gere), a charming, debonair bachelor who apparently has trouble getting along with women he cannot hire and fire. Edward is alone on business for a week in Los Angeles, and one night, on a whim, he borrows a fancy car from his lawyer (Jason Alexander) and winds up in the red-light district. He says he was really looking for Beverly Hills. Edward spots a gorgeous hooker named Vivian and asks her for directions, nothing more. But soon the two have struck up a business arrangement whereby Vivian will provide a week's worth of companionship for a $3,000 fee. The film's title was changed to ''Pretty Woman'' from ''3,000,'' so it can't be said that everything about it is in bad taste. And the hooker is played by Julia Roberts, who is so enchantingly beautiful, so funny, so natural and such an absolute delight that it is hard to hold anything against the movie. Edward and Vivian take up residence at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, which is plugged so incessantly throughout the film that you may find yourself trying to ring for room service. There, Edward has defied his fear of heights to stay in the penthouse because, as he explains it, ''It's the best.'' Their first evening together is somewhat awkward because the film, directed by Garry Marshall and written by J. F. Lawton, cannot decide whether to be leering or falsely naive. A compromise of sorts is reached when Vivian apparently performs her professional services upon Edward (Mr. Marshall discreetly cuts away after a faint suggestion) while he watches ''I Love Lucy.''Once the ice is broken, it is time for the film's true raison d'etre to emerge. ''Pretty Woman'' isn't about sex, but about conspicuous consumption. Edward says things like ''I took the liberty of ordering everything on the menu,'' and he sets Vivian loose on Rodeo Drive with his credit cards in hand. Later in the story, after she has been snubbed by shopkeepers because of an overly hookerish outfit (the costume designer, Marilyn Vance-Straker, has to go way over the top to offend Rodeo Drive standards of propriety), Edward escorts her personally and enters one boutique, declaring, ''We're going to be spending an obscene amount of money in here.'' One evening, Edward takes Vivian via limousine and private jet to the opera in San Francisco, borrowing several thousand dollars' worth of necklace for her to wear. Everything in the movie has a price tag. What happens, of course, is that Vivian emerges from her humble existence to become the lovely, gracious, opera-loving lady who can fill the void in Edward's lonely life. Astonishingly, no one connected with ''Pretty Woman'' seems to have acknowledged any significant difference between a Cockney flower-seller and a prostitute who is willing to get into a car driven by a perfect stranger and whose roommate (Laura San Giacomo) has spent the rent money on drugs. Every now and then, just to add to the film's confusion on this basic issue, Vivian picks a fight with Edward and accuses him of treating her like a prostitute. But Edward can hardly be blamed for having a memory that goes back longer than three days. Despite this quintessentially late 80's outlook, and despite a covetousness and underlying misogyny that bring Mr. Marshall's earlier ''Overboard'' to mind, ''Pretty Woman'' manages to be giddy, lighthearted escapism much of the time. Ms. Roberts, as noted, is a complete knockout, and this performance will make her a major star. (The dying-swan role in ''Steel Magnolias'' that won her this year's Oscar nomination seems very pale by comparison.) Mr. Gere is mildly constrained by the button-down aspects of Edward's character, but he manages to be dapper, amusing, and the perfect foil. Though it has not been that long since he himself was on the other side of the Hollywood gigolo equation, he conveys a dignity and presence well suited to a soon-to-be-radicalized captain of industry. Ms. San Giacomo adds a welcome note of reality to the film during her brief appearances, as well as a coarseness suggesting that not every Hollywood prostitute is cut out to play Galatea. Hector Elizondo is particularly winning as the supercilious hotel manager who, like everyone else in ''Pretty Woman'' except those Rodeo Drive shopkeepers, falls in love with Vivian on sight.''I appreciate this seduction scene you got goin','' Ms. Roberts's Vivian tells Edward early in the story, ''but let me give you a tip: I'm a sure thing.''

FILM REVIEW; Jokes on Rude (Russian) And Stuck Up (French) - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from February 17, 1995, Section C, Page 6Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The drawing seen at the start of Yuri Mamin's ""Window to Paris"" looks like a charming French street scene, but it disintegrates before the viewer's very eyes. As the picture comes to life, stylized Gallic gaiety gives way to Russian reality, with drab colors, clumsy buffoonery, a circus atmosphere and a long line for vodka destroying any suggestion of hedonism or style. Contrasting such stereotypes of French and Russian culture, Mr. Mamin makes his countrymen the butt of an extended, wistful joke. His film asks what would happen to Russians who could suddenly escape their impoverished society and find themselves in the midst of French culture, which they regard with a mixture of suspicion, envy and disbelief.""Who protected them from the Tartar Mongols?"" one of the film's Russian characters asks belligerently, once the ""Twilight Zone""-type device of the title lets them step directly from St. Petersburg to a rooftop within view of the Eiffel Tower. ""We held them back for 200 years. Meanwhile, they"" -- the French -- ""evolved.""""Window to Paris,"" a buffoonish culture-clash comedy with a broadly sentimental streak, relies on similar French-Russian disparities as its only sure-fire source of wit, though Mr. Mamin doesn't explore his premise cleverly enough to keep the film steadily aloft. Alongside the occasional droll comparison of national temperments, there's also quite a bit of silliness involving a pretty French taxidermist whose studio happens to look out on the magic window. Language barrier gags abound, as do scenes juxtaposing boorish, drunken Russians with the haughtier, more self-possessed French. The film maker's ideas about both nations remain unsurprising, since they're fully apparent from the very start.""Window to Paris,"" which opens today at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, stars Sergei Dontsov as Nikolai, the clownish, sad-sack music teacher who accidentally stumbles across the gateway to French culture. Assigned to a crowded, boisterous apartment where the residents store groceries inside their several pianos, he is given the room of a recently deceased old woman, who kept models of Parisian landmarks as part of her decor. It's typical of the film's coarse comic style that this old woman appears not as a mysterious, ghostly figure but as one more cantankerous character on an already-crowded scene. Not surprising, the escape hatch out of Russia has great allure. Soon Nikolai and his neighbors are making regular trips across time and space, managing to get so drunk in the process that it takes them a while to grasp the magnitude of their adventure. Once the drunk jokes subside and the premise sinks in, Mr. Mamin himself has nowhere to go, and the film begins taking weightlessly farcical turns. Eventually, it reaches a moment of sufficient toothlessness for Nikolai to tell his music students: ""You were born at the wrong time in a miserable, bankrupt country. But it's still your country. Can't you make it a better place?""Mr. Mamin, whose film making is more spirited than accomplished, doesn't do much to further that cause. The film's Russia-bashing culminates in a bleak interlude when the French taxidermist finds herself passing through the looking glass and getting nightmarishly stuck in St. Petersburg. Unlike tougher Russian directors like Pavel Lungine (""Taxi Blues""), Mr. Mamin doesn't take a bitter, scorching view of his country's troubles, preferring instead to poke gentle fun and look on the sunny side. By the time ""Window to Paris"" is over, songs and balloons and sweetness have supplanted any possible sting.

"‘Almost Love’ Review: Schooled in Romance, but Missing Class - The New York Times","In the comedy “Almost Love,” romance springs from a love of one’s class. The movie follows a group of 30-something New Yorkers who support one another through various stages of relationships. Ensconced in their close-knit circle, they chatter, deeming which partners are perfect and which ones deserve the boot. But the one subject these chatty characters never touch is class, despite their obvious obsession with it. Adam (Scott Evans) and Marklin (Augustus Prew) are at the center of this intertwined crew. They have been together for five years, but their sense of intimacy has started to deteriorate and their friends aren’t holding up any better. One, Elizabeth (Kate Walsh), seems to have the perfect relationship with her husband, until infidelity shakes its foundations. Another, Haley (Zoe Chao) is confused in her role as a college counselor when a particularly dependent student develops a crush on her. As these characters stumble and joke their way toward their inevitably happy endings, they flirt with shallowness. The film’s writer and director Mike Doyle does too. It’s particularly shown in the character of Cammy (Michelle Buteau), who has found a guy she likes enough to stay home with, despite her concerns he’s not totally Mr. Right. In short, her beau, Henry (Colin Donnell), is homeless. Cammy’s fears about how his housing reflects on her own stability are uncomfortably played for laughs, which only underscores the movie’s confused attitude toward social class. “Almost Love” teases you with glimpses into Manhattanite pocketbooks with references to exorbitant rents or entitled, wealthy clients. But each time money enters the story, the film dances around the issue, treating the characters’ investments in one another as solely emotional. When Elizabeth rejects a flirtation with a handsome ice cream man, she complains that he only wants to talk about his boring job. The movie never follows up and never leaves room to consider that these genial people with nice apartments and Ivy League diplomas might have an obnoxious sense of who is in their league. The aimless characters in “Almost Love” like to talk through their feelings, their aspirations, their disappointments, but there is little substance in their epiphanies, and the comedy is too low key to make up for its absence. In this comedy of romantic manners, class solidarity is the love that dares not speak its name. Almost LoveNot rated. Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes.

‘The Hottest August’ Review: Ordinary New Yorkers Facing Extreme Heat - The New York Times,"coming after the summer of 2016. Story’s camera wanders to neighborhoods and corners that are, by movie standards, obscure. Not that they are threatening. In a white aluminum-sided house, an older gentleman hangs out a window and talks to the camera about the faded glories of having been in the Teamsters. In a marsh in Brooklyn, a member of the American Littoral Society tells a tale of settling 28 nesting pairs of osprey where once there were none. In a bar, an even older gentleman spins his own wheels complaining about how “Everybody wants a job but nobody wants to work.” On TV monitors Story finds other events, like the riots in Charlottesville, Va., that culminated in the murder of Heather Heyer. It’s something, the film implies, that few of us saw coming, or were prepared to deal with. The heat, while not record-breaking, is still strong. Story’s film finds its New Yorkers coping and trying to divert themselves in an environment that’s fraught in every sense of the word. This collection of interactions with ordinary people is a cinematic gift both simple and multilayered, an intellectual challenge and an emotional adventure. The Hottest AugustNot rated.

‘Britt-Marie Was Here’ Review: Scrubbing Away Years of Indifference - The New York Times,"When the slight Swedish comedy “Britt-Marie Was Here” introduces its title character, her life can be measured by the trail of meticulous organization left in her wake. Every day, she washes the windows, loads the laundry, arranges the dishware and prepares elaborate dinners for her husband, Kent (Peter Haber), who hardly notices. For 40 years of marriage, Britt-Marie (Pernilla August) has operated on a schedule of lather, rinse and repeat. In predictable fashion, Britt-Marie discovers that Kent’s disengagement stems from infidelity. But her reaction is more surprising than Kent’s cheating. With little sentimentality, Britt-Marie leaves her home to make a life of her own. She takes a job in the small town of Borg working at a youth center, where her primary duty is to coach a children’s soccer team. Tight-lipped Britt-Marie is not a natural fit for her lively charges, who have little regard for the order that Britt-Marie exercises over her space. But over time she warms, finding a place for herself in a community that welcomes her ability to tidy up even the most persistent messes. “Britt-Marie Was Here” is a relatively unchallenging yet ultimately pleasant watch. Despite Britt-Marie’s outsized focus on cleanliness, the director Tuva Novotny forgoes exaggerated style and instead aims to deliver an earnest portrait of an older woman as she pursues happiness. The genial mood is aided by a plucky score, and a restrained performance from August in the lead role. She resists making Britt-Marie’s loneliness maudlin, and as her character’s rigidity softens, August’s restraint with gestures of affection make each smile and each laugh feel like they’ve been hard-earned.

But to bring his project to fruition, he needs wealth and connections. So he courts Jakobe (Katrine Greis-Rosenthal), the elder daughter of a well-connected family, in a romance initially rooted more in Per’s ambition than his ardor. But their backgrounds clash: She has a high social standing and is Jewish. He is poor and, despite his desire to reject his father, inwardly conflicted about his strict Christian upbringing. He is also too headstrong to bootlick. The sprawling narrative sometimes gets the best of August. (Is the waitress Per rejects forgotten by him, or just by the movie?) And his habit of over-explaining each new development appears to have removed nuance from a much more textured story. “A Fortunate Man” is a great advertisement for the book.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/movies/a-fortunate-man-review-a-danish-engineer-strives-for-success.html

It will take all her resolve to choose neither. In many respects, “Becoming Astrid” is your standard biographical drama, its familiar beats untroubled by narrative daring or stylistic surprises. But Erik Molberg Hansen’s relaxed camera movements and fuzzy-soft compositions are quite beautiful, and the performances — including the superb Trine Dyrholm as the baby’s Danish foster mother — are pitch-perfect. Best of all is the magnetic August, whose open, mobile features can slide from plain to lovely with just a shift in the light and whose embrace of the character is a joy to watch. Bracketed by scenes filled with the voices of children as the aging Lindgren reads her fan mail, “Becoming Astrid” transforms teenage trauma into the wellspring of a lifelong gift.

"Review: In ‘The Young Karl Marx,’ a Scruffy Specter Haunts Europe - The New York Times","at least the decisive chapter chronicled in “The Young Karl Marx” — turns out to be a buddy movie. Marx (August Diehl), a scruffy journalist, and his sidekick Friedrich Engels (Stefan Konarske), a renegade rich kid, meet in Cologne, Germany, in 1844 and overcome some initial wariness by bonding over their shared contempt for the Young Hegelians. (Man, those guys are lame.) They set out to write a “Critique of Critical Criticism,” and when it’s published (as “The Holy Family”), it’s something of a hit. By the time the revolutions of 1848 are ready to happen, Marx and Engels are the Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the European left, rock stars for an age of revolution. Scrupulously faithful to the biographical record, “The Young Karl Marx,” directed by Raoul Peck (from a script he wrote with Pascal Bonitzer), is both intellectually serious and engagingly free-spirited. The founders of Communism, full of intensity and ambition and sporting contrasting beards, look and act like pioneers of brocialism. They spend some drunken evenings hashing out the labor theory of value — Engels holds his liquor better than Marx — and many hours, together and separately, in furious paroxysms of thought. Thinking notoriously resists being captured on film, and Mr. Peck often falls back on its most common analogues, scribbling and smoking. Marx in particular does a lot of those things. But Mr. Diehl’s performance is a marvel of itchy intelligence, and it strips away almost all of the character’s accumulated importance. “The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living,” a slightly older Marx wrote, and what is most remarkable, indeed most exciting, about “The Young Marx” is how lightly that burden rests upon it. Mr. Peck’s earlier features include “Lumumba,” a scripted biography of the Congolese leader, and “I am Not Your Negro,” a documentary drawn from the work of James Baldwin. (His résumé also includes a stint as Haiti’s minister of culture.) While in form and style the new movie is a fairly straightforward biopic, it is also fundamentally the portrait of a writer, a man of letters grappling with both the mundane and the lofty demands of his vocation. Until his partnership with Engels is solidified — and access to some of the Engels’s family wealth is secured — Marx struggles with deadlines, antagonizes editors and lives in bohemian penury with his wife, Jenny (Vicky Krieps), and their infant daughter. The family is harassed by bill collectors and also by the police, bouncing from Cologne to Paris to Brussels as Marx’s political agitation brands him a dangerous subversive. He is also embroiled in a series of volatile alliances with eminent figures of the European left, notably Wilhelm Weitling (Alexander Scheer), a bombastic orator whose ideas sound vaporous at best, and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (the marvelous Olivier Gourmet), a good-natured philosopher who seems to be the hardest-working anarchist in show business. Those names are fairly obscure today, while Marx’s is still attached to an -ism, however battered. (Does that count as a spoiler?) He and Engels stage both a theoretical and an organizational coup, replacing utopian nostrums about the brotherhood of man with a doctrine of conflict between the proletarian and the bourgeoisie. The rest is history, bloody and contentious and not yet finished. Marx and Engels’s takeover of a stodgy workers’-rights group called the League of the Just is a premonition of the tactical ruthlessness that would become characteristic of Communist parties in the 20th century. To put it in the language of 21st-century capitalism, the founders of Communism are disrupters and innovators, in possession of the entrepreneurial doggedness and the self-righteous zeal required to bend the world to their will. “The Young Karl Marx” is a highly individualized picture of the authors of a doctrine of collective struggle. This contradiction (to revert to Marxist vocabulary) is precisely what energizes the film and rescues it from the twin dangers of tedium and sentimentality. There are other knots of irony and dialectical difficulty, notably with respect to the status of women within the global program of emancipation the two dudes so grandly envision. Jenny Marx is a rebellious Prussian aristocrat; Engels’s wife, Mary Burns (Hannah Steele), is a rebellious Irish factory worker. The two women provide a degree of centrifugal energy, pulling the story away from politics toward matters of the heart and hearth. But they also, for exactly that reason, expose gaps in their husbands’ emerging theory of inequality and exploitation. Jenny and Mary support Karl and Friedrich’s work wholeheartedly, but also within the parameters of a division of labor that seems beyond the reach of their politics. They clear the dishes, tend the children, hand out fliers and hang banners — part of the history but also at its margins. I’m not suggesting that this is a lapse on Mr. Peck’s part. On the contrary, the way his film deals with family matters and gender relations is an aspect of its precision and a measure of its insight. The great virtue of “The Young Karl Marx” is its clarity, its ability to perceive the way the eddies of personal experience flow within the wider stream of history.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/movies/the-young-karl-marx-review.html
"Review: ‘A Gray State,’ Behind a Filmmaker’s Madness - The New York Times","After serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, David Crowley began work on a spectacularly ambitious feature film called “Gray State.” As we learn in the new documentary “A Gray State,” Mr. Crowley’s movie was supposed to be a dystopian thriller designed as a warning against authoritarian control. Mr. Crowley made a concept trailer that appeared online in 2012 and garnered a huge following. But despite signs of progress, the film never happened. Mr. Crowley was found dead in January 2015, along with his wife and daughter, in what police concluded was a double homicide and suicide: He had shot his family and then himself. Perhaps because Mr. Crowley was drawn to the paranoid fringe (he is shown meeting and watching Alex Jones), the deaths became a cause for conspiracy theorists. The documentary’s director, Erik Nelson (a producer on “Grizzly Man”), explores the disjunction between the charismatic filmmaker-to-be with a penchant for both self-promotion and self-documentation and a man who was, it eventually seems clear, descending into mental illness. In one scene that captures the apparent duality of Mr. Crowley, the movie features an interview with two entertainment executives who speak enthusiastically about a meeting with him. Mr. Nelson then shows them as they listen to audio recorded beforehand in which Mr. Crowley describes plans to manipulate them. There’s a morbid fascination inherent to documentaries like “A Gray State,” which is engrossing for the reasons it’s also unsatisfying: As Adam Shambour, a friend of Mr. Crowley’s, says, it’s a mystery that answers all the major questions except “Why?”",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/review-a-gray-state-behind-a-filmmakers-madness.html
"Review: ‘Come What May,’ an Ode to French Villagers Displaced by War - The New York Times","The French film director Christian Carion, whose Oscar-nominated audience pleaser, “Joyeux Noël,” depicted a heartwarming temporary détente between World War I combatants, opens his latest film with a few words of historical context. He follows those with a dedication to his mother, who was among many citizens in northern France who were displaced by the German invasion of May 1940. “Come What May” grafts a suspense narrative involving multinational characters to a story of genial rural folk compelled to flee their homes before they’re overrun by bloodthirsty trespassers. Mr. Carion has lined up an impressive and committed cast. The haunted-looking August Diehl plays a German anti-Nazi activist who finds short-lived sanctuary in France with his young son. Olivier Gourmet is a wise and kindly village mayor, and Mathilde Seigner is his warm but no-nonsense wife. Alice Isaaz is a sweet, sensitive schoolteacher. The Welsh actor Matthew Rhys plays a Scottish Army officer who is forced to take a considerable detour on the way to Dunkirk. The packed-with-incident screenplay, by Mr. Carion and Laure Irrmann, includes several suspenseful scenes that Mr. Carion pulls off effectively with his direction. The depredations of the Nazis are depicted in a way that will make viewers want to declare war on Germany anew. But “Come What May” is also too pretty of a movie. It is often sentimental and, worse, schematic. An early scene set in a cemetery is sufficiently weighted that, later, when a different graveyard turns up, what takes place there is not so much moving as predictable. For all the tragedy depicted, “Come What May” is war movie as comfort food, and the familiar score by Ennio Morricone is not exempted from that judgment. GLENN KENNY“Come What May” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence and adult themes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/movies/come-what-may-review.html
"Review: ‘Land and Shade,’ Set Among Colombia’s Sugar Farmers - The New York Times","the cane leaves, we’re told, cut like razors — and are shortchanged pay. When it focuses on the workers, the movie resembles the films of John Sayles, who often juxtaposes a family drama with an expansive sociological portrait. In “Land and Shade,” the setting holds more interest than the plot: a fable-like, elemental story that sketches its characters too faintly to develop much power. Alfonso (Haimer Leal) returns home after years away to see Gerardo (Edison Raigosa), his son, who is largely bedridden because of a farming-related respiratory ailment. Gerardo would be better off moving away, as his wife (Marleyda Soto) wishes, but he stays because of his aging mother (Hilda Ruiz), who regards Alfonso with disdain. While Alfonso gets to know his grandson (José Felipe Cárdenas), Mr. Acevedo emphasizes atmosphere, whether it’s in the birdcalls on the soundtrack or shots of ash raining down as fields are burned. The opening composition — in which Alfonso, walking down a dirt road, is forced to make way for a giant truck — captures the movie’s perspective in miniature, and little of the restrained material that follows can match that shot’s simple power.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/movies/land-and-shade-review.html
Review: ‘Paulo Coelho’s Best Story’ Hopscotches Through an Author’s Career - The New York Times,"Before the Brazilian author Paulo Coelho published his mythic quest of a fable, “The Alchemist,” he had already written plays, put out a magazine, made hit records with the Brazilian rock star Raul Seixas and became a music executive. So the title of this biopic, “Paulo Coelho’s Best Story,” is apt: His own life might well be his greatest work. A pity, then, that the film, directed by Daniel Augusto, doesn’t chronicle his evolution better, leapfrogging among decades instead. There’s Paulo (Júlio Andrade) in 2013, stopped for autographs while heading to a party for the 25th anniversary of “The Alchemist.” There he is in the ’60s in Rio de Janeiro, a rebellious, suicidal teenager (played by Ravel Andrade, Júlio’s brother) fighting his stern father, and twice winding up in psychiatric institutions. In the ’70s, he’s collaborating with Raul (Lucci Ferreira); and in the ’80s, he’s married and restless, taking a life-changing trip along Camino de Santiago in Spain that will be the source of his first novel, “The Pilgrimage.” To be fair, dramatizing an author’s process is never easy: Paulo bangs away on his typewriter, smokes, tosses pages. Júlio Andrade’s performance seems limited to displays of rage and self-satisfaction. (Ravel Andrade, though, is an effective welter of youthful confusion.)One theme through the years is the resistance that Paulo faces in pursuing his chosen path. “No one makes a living by writing,” his father pleads. Even his editor, when he submits “The Alchemist,” tells him, “This book isn’t good.” A writer recalling every slight and naysayer? This film gets that right, at least.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/movies/review-paulo-coelhos-best-story-hopscotches-through-an-authors-career.html
"‘Waiting for August,’ a Documentary - The New York Times","there’s no father in the picture — Georgiana is the de facto adult in a household of children and teenagers, who all accept their temporarily orphaned status with admirable equanimity. Fall Arts Preview - Times 100How to wade through the crush of culture coming your way this season? Here’s a guide to 100 events that have us especially excited, in order of appearance. Unseen and unheard, the Romanian director Teodora Ana Mihai — whose parents fled to Belgium during the Ceausescu regime, leaving her behind for a year as collateral for the secret service — captures the siblings’ emotional limbo with evident empathy. Their home is a cramped apartment in Bacau, their daily routine giving Georgiana little time to study for important exams. Capably mediating disputes and comforting the little ones, she never complains; only on rare outings with friends do we see her serious, patient features transform into those of the carefree teenager she may never have the chance to become. Soft in tone and muted in color, “Waiting for August” is a child’s-eye view of one family — among many in today’s Romanian economy — rising to the challenge of living without parents. On Skype and on the telephone, in conversations and in the mail, the mother is a constant, longing presence, her summer return a fixed point of anticipation.

"‘The Last Sentence,’ About the Journalist Torgny Segerstedt - The New York Times","It’s plausible that Torgny Segerstedt, a crusading Swedish journalist, was every bit as heroic, freethinking and sexually irresistible to women as he is portrayed in “The Last Sentence.” But you will need to take it on faith even after seeing this stultifying movie, a fictionalization of how Segerstedt (1876-1945) positioned himself on the right side of history by writing an editorial that declared “Herr Hitler is an insult.” Hermann Göring sent a telegram objecting to this boldly tossed gauntlet, one of many such complaints that challenged Segerstedt’s lonely fight. The director Jan Troell lavishes almost as much time on the image of Torgny (a fine Jesper Christensen) putting pen to paper, the implement scratching in close-up, as on the scene in which Göring’s telegram is read aloud to a roomful of newspaper employees. Or at least that’s how it registers. Segerstedt is remembered in history books for voicing opposition to Hitler, beginning in 1933, and Mr. Troell, a veteran filmmaker whose titles include “The Emigrants” and “The New Land,” clearly sees this protest as one man’s defining moment. Yet it’s one that also fights for attention with a family melodrama, a marital soap opera and many canine reaction shots. For the next few decades, Torgny keeps up the good fight, writing against both Nazism and what he sees as Sweden’s concessionary stance toward Germany, even during wartime. In between issuing denunciations, he juggles his depressed wife, Puste (Ulla Skoog), and his considerably more vivacious mistress, Maja (Pernilla August), a Jewish heiress who’s married to his paper’s genial, tolerant publisher, Axel (Bjorn Granath). Puste is sympathetic but a drag; Maya is unsympathetic but a bon vivant; the dogs are altogether charming. For a former theology student, Torgny, whose life has the geometric shape of two often overlapping triangles, comes off as almost rock ’n’ roll. It’s too bad that the movie can’t find his pulse and instead delivers a tastefully bland, inert portrait of a man whose personal ugliness it acknowledges without excavating. Although its black-and-white visuals catch the eye, “The Last Sentence” soon loosens its hold on your attention by flooding the story with mind-numbing, uninteresting details while real history slips through the cracks. Hitler invades Poland, Torgny walks his dogs, anti-Semitic caricatures arrive, Puste loses her grip: all receive more or less the same narrative weight, which means that none of them stick. The real Segerstedt died on March 31, 1945, a month before Hitler committed suicide in his bunker.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/movies/the-last-sentence-about-the-journalist-torgny-segerstedt.html
"‘August: Osage County,’ With Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts - The New York Times","Beverly and Violet’s three daughters and their various menfolk, as well as Violet’s sister and brother-in-law — is secondary to the spectacle the actors make of themselves. Really, “acting” is an inadequate word for what the cast of this movie is doing. Maybe, in honor of one of the leading industries in the Sooner State, we should call it “fracting.” The application of enormous pressure is involved, a great quantity of subterranean gas is forced to the surface, and the environmental consequences are likely to be controversial. Another way to think of “August: Osage County,” which was directed by John Wells and adapted by Tracy Letts from his own play, is as a thespian cage match. Within a circumscribed space, a bunch of unquestionably talented performers is assembled with no instructions other than to top one another. One twitchy confession must be excelled by another. The same with smoldering, sarcastic speeches, explosions of tears, wistful jags of nostalgia and imperious gazes of disgust. It goes without saying that nobody can beat Ms. Streep at this game. Remember Amy Adams in “Julie and Julia”? Anne Hathaway in “The Devil Wears Prada”? Anyone at all in “The Iron Lady”? Of course not. Here Ms. Streep smokes, rants, bites her fingers, slurs her speech and spews obscenities with the gusto of a tornado laying waste to a small town. Julia Roberts, playing Barbara, Beverly’s favorite daughter and therefore Violet’s rival, tries to hold her own by refusing to smile. She also slaps a face and breaks a plate. It’s hardly a fair contest. But everyone joins in. Ewan McGregor, as Barbara’s half-estranged husband, affects a pained smile. Abigail Breslin, as their teenage daughter, Jean, pouts and seethes. Juliette Lewis and Dermot Mulroney, as Barbara’s sister Karen and her sleazy new fiancé, stop in from another, much more entertaining, movie, one full of sex and danger and naughtiness. As the last sister, Ivy, Julianne Nicholson looks miserable. Benedict Cumberbatch, as a delicate cousin known as Little Charles, blinks his eyes and struggles with his accent. Some of them also break plates. The only people who look at all at ease — and who are genuinely pleasant to watch — are Margo Martindale and Chris Cooper, as Little Charles’s parents, Mattie Fae and Charles. “August: Osage County” falls into an uncanny valley between melodrama and camp, failing to achieve either heights of operatic feeling or flights of knowing parody. The jokes are too labored, too serious. The serious moments tilt toward the preposterous, above all a climactic revelation that seems, on sober examination, to be more of a technical detail than a seismic explosion. I never saw Mr. Letts’s play onstage, so I will defer to the judgment of the 2008 Pulitzer Prize jury and my theatergoing brethren in the critical profession. It is possible that Mr. Wells has simply mishandled the material, riding roughshod over subtleties and muffling bravura moments. But it also may be that the awkward transition from stage to screen has exposed weak spots in Mr. Letts’s dramatic architecture and bald spots in his writing. The movie is a quilt stitched together from borrowed scraps of the American theatrical canon — a panel of Eugene O’Neill, some bright threads of Tennessee Williams, ribbons of Beth Henley — without much fresh insight into family relations, human psychology or life on the Plains. What the movie does have is Johnna (Misty Upham), the Native American woman who is the target of Beverly’s opening monologue and who serves as cook, nurse, maid and silent judge for the rest of the film. If “August” were set a few states over — say in Mississippi — Johnna would be African-American, not so much for demographic as for symbolic reasons. She is a stereotype: the wise, patient, self-effacing Other on hand to serve as the audience’s surrogate and the writer’s alibi, providing assurance that the play and its public are more enlightened than all these crazy white people we’re busy gawking at. Johnna does take action at one point, interrupting an incident of especially egregious misbehavior by attacking the perpetrator with a shovel. She pulls back before any harm is done, which represents, for this movie, both an uncharacteristic moment of restraint and a missed opportunity. She could have kept going and turned this thing into a blood bath. No jury in the land would convict her. “August: Osage County” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Jeremy Irons and Lena Olin Star in ‘Night Train to Lisbon’ - The New York Times,"Early in “Night Train to Lisbon,” Raimund Gregorius (Jeremy Irons), a stuffy academic, remarks that his wife left him because she found him boring. Oh how right she was! As played by Mr. Irons, leading a prestigious cast speaking English in an indecipherable mishmash of accents, Raimund undergoes a late midlife crisis. Impulsively abandoning his comfortable post as a teacher of classical studies in Bern, Switzerland, he travels to Lisbon. Raimund is as parched and pedantic a creature as T. S. Eliot’s J. Alfred Prufrock, and Mr. Irons voices his thoughts in a tone of sepulchral weariness that contradicts the character’s supposed awakening. Mr. Irons’s buttoned-up performance matches a screenplay (by Greg Latter and Ulrich Herrmann) in which most of the action remains off screen. “Night Train to Lisbon,” directed by Bille August (“Pelle the Conqueror”), was adapted from a philosophical novel by the oft-quoted Swiss author Pascal Mercier. His quotations, spoken in voice-over by Mr. Irons, are sprinkled through the movie to add a semblance of intellectual heft. But these mutterings are too disconnected and abstract to register as profound insights by a man in the process of self-discovery. “The fear of death might be described as the fear of not being able to become whom one had planned to be,” goes one. “We leave something of ourselves behind when we leave a place; we stay there, even though we go away,” goes another. “In youth we live as if we were immortal. Knowledge of mortality capers around us like a brittle paper ribbon that barely touches our skin.” Yada yada yada. Raimund’s odyssey begins when, by chance, he meets a young woman who is about to leap from a bridge to her death. He brings her to one of his classes, where she accidentally leaves her coat; in a pocket is a book by the Portuguese doctor and poet Amadeu de Prado, along with a train ticket to Lisbon. Raimund’s curiosity is aroused by what he reads, and he boards the train. Once in Portugal, he looks up the author; visits his severe sister, Adriana (Charlotte Rampling); and learns that Amadeu died in 1974 and that only 100 copies of his book were printed. The movie proceeds as a historical detective story that intersperses Raimund’s investigation with lengthy flashbacks to a past in which we meet the young Amadeu (Jack Huston), a charismatic member of the resistance to the dictatorship of António Salazar. Although these scenes present ample opportunities for action, suspense and melodrama, the characters rarely come to life. As the movie awkwardly boomerangs between past and present, most of what we see and hear is laborious exposition. Through Adriana, Raimund meets the priest (Christopher Lee) who taught Amadeu. He tracks down Amadeu’s best friend, Jorge (Bruno Ganz) and learns of Estefania (Mélanie Laurent), a resistance fighter who was Jorge’s girlfriend until she laid eyes on Amadeu and they were instantly smitten. (August Diehl is the young Jorge.) Through Mariana (Martina Gedeck), a friendly optician who assures Raimund that he is not boring, he meets her aged Uncle Joao (Tom Courtenay), another member of the resistance who fills in the story. (Marco D’Almeida plays the young Joao.) Late in the movie, Raimund finally meets the mature Estefania (the beautiful Lena Olin), but no revelations are forthcoming. After barely stirring to life, “Night Train to Lisbon” mercifully expires. “Night Train to Lisbon” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for a scene of violence and brief sexuality.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/movies/jeremy-irons-and-lena-olin-star-in-night-train-to-lisbon.html

The characters do not escape stereotyping, but the film deserves credit for looking at Shannon’s view of the relationship as well as that of the smug urban professionals.

"‘Nicky’s Family,’ a True Story of Heroism - The New York Times","In 1988 a BBC talk show, “That’s Life,” invited Nicholas Winton, then 79, to sit in the front row of the studio audience while his good works were praised. He had saved the lives of 669 children, most of them Jewish, in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia with his own personal Kindertransport. The woman sitting next to him at the show was one of them. And if you don’t feel teary when Mr. Winton learns on the air that virtually everyone in the audience that day had been one of those children, you have no heart. The scene appears in “Nicky’s Family,” an enthralling documentary by Matej Minac that artfully tells the story of how Mr. Winton, now 104, a British stockbroker, gave up a 1938 skiing holiday to answer a friend’s request for help in Prague and didn’t stop helping until the war’s beginning stopped him. He worked frantically, placing youngsters in English homes; put away photos and documents about his project; and told nobody, not even his wife. She eventually discovered his scrapbooks in the attic; his secrecy is never fully explained. With lovely cinematography and lively editing, the story is told in vintage black-and-white film clips that seem oddly fresh; present-day interviews; and the kind of dramatic re-creation video usually seen on basic-cable crime or ghost shows. But those scenes, shot in muted colors with hints of sepia, are surprisingly evocative. The Canadian journalist Joe Schlesinger narrates. He, too, was one of the 669.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/movies/nickys-family-a-true-story-of-heroism.html
"‘Augustine,’ by Alice Winocour, Featuring Soko - The New York Times","or at least the underlying current of emotion — is also part of how the treatment works. In the end of all these films, it is the healers who suffer, becoming more helpless and tormented as their vulnerable patients surrender, seduce and fight back. Everything depends on the subtlety of the direction and the charisma of the performances. “Augustine” is intellectually satisfying partly because it communicates its ideas at the level of feeling, through the uncanny power of Soko’s face and body. A well-known French pop singer, she is as grave and luminous as a silent-film star. Augustine slowly emerges from her cocoon of ignorance and fear, and we see her acquiring self-knowledge and tools for survival, and in the process our pity turns to awe.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/movies/augustine-by-alice-winocour-featuring-soko.html
"‘Oslo, August 31st,’ Directed by Joachim Trier - The New York Times","redemption down one path, catastrophe down the other — but Anders (Anders Danielsen Lie), Mr. Trier’s protagonist, faces such a choice at every waking moment. You are never sure what he will do next, and it is clear that he is not, either. Nor does he necessarily know why he makes the choices he does, or what they mean. We meet Anders in the morning, as he awakens after a night in a nondescript motel with a woman we barely see. He makes his way back to the rehab center where he lives, stopping along the way for a suicide attempt that may, for all we know, be a daily ritual of halfhearted self-destruction. He fills his jacket pockets with stones and wades into a pond, only to emerge a few seconds later soaked, embarrassed and resigned to the continued ordeal of existence. Nearing the end of his stint in recovery — after years of drug abuse that damaged his career and his relationships with friends and family — Anders, who is 34, travels to Oslo for a job interview. He also stops in on an old pal named Thomas (Hans Olav Brenner), a married literature teacher with two young children, who envies Anders’s unattached state and looks back wistfully on their wild times together. The city is full of memories, associations and temptations, and as Anders marks time with brooding cups of coffee and antsy cigarettes, a central, elemental dramatic question takes shape. Will he make it through this day without relapsing, and if not, what will the consequences be?Mr. Trier, whose previous feature was the layered, literary psychological drama “Reprise” (also starring Mr. Lie), observes Anders with a mixture of coolness and compassion. We are at his side during virtually every second of the film, and yet in spite of this apparent intimacy, he remains something of an enigma, just beyond the reach of our full understanding or unguarded sympathy. And this makes us like nearly everyone else in Anders’s life, with the possible exception of a young woman he meets for the first time at a party, who is drawn to his quiet, melancholy air and unaware of his history. Nobody else knows quite how to deal with him. Clean, Anders is a specter of his former self, visiting old haunts without being fully there. He calls an old girlfriend, who has moved to New York, leaving increasingly desperate messages on her voice mail. He places himself, either deliberately or out of habit, in risky situations, and we follow his actions with a growing sense of helplessness and dread. “Oslo, August 31st,” loosely based on “Le Feu Follet,” a 1931 novel by the French writer Pierre Drieu La Rochelle (adapted for film by Louis Malle in 1963), is neither sensationalistic nor punishingly bleak. There is sometimes a generic quality to movies about addiction, perhaps because of the leveling power of the disease, which can afflict anyone, regardless of background. Anders is smart — a once-promising intellectual who has published articles in highbrow journals — and was raised, it seems, by kind and loving parents. He has no good explanation for the pain he has inflicted on himself and others, which may make it harder to heal. But Mr. Trier and Mr. Lie — a quiet, recessive but nonetheless magnetically self-assured screen presence — emphasize Anders’s individuality above all. “Oslo, August 31st” has the satisfying gravity of specific experience, and also, true to its title, a prickly sense of place. Oslo is Anders’s home, the scene of his happiest and most dreadful experiences, and the film, chilly as it is, is warmed by a love for the city that the filmmaker and the character clearly share.",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/movies/oslo-august-31st-directed-by-joachim-trier.html

Lovely but directionless, “The Swell Season” is a time capsule of scattered impressions and isolated moments.

FILM REVIEW;A Poor Little Boy Befriended by Bugs - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from April 12, 1996, Section C, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. As mainstream movies for adults go dumb and dumber, children's films inversely take the high road. And the new sophistication of fairy-tale entertainment has become so acute that its fairy-tale qualities may actually pale by comparison. So ""James and the Giant Peach,"" the latest animated film from Disney, is a technological marvel, arch and innovative with a daringly offbeat visual conception. But it's also a strenuously artful film with a macabre edge that may scare small children. And beyond that, it lacks a clear idea of who its audience might be.""James and the Giant Peach"" draws upon an extraordinary array of sardonic talent. Its basis is an amazingly fanciful novel by Roald Dahl, replete with Dahl harpies and the wondrous image of a huge peach drifting through the sky. Its director is Henry Selick, with the comparably ground-breaking but dramatically weak ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" to his credit. Tim Burton and Denise Di Novi, well-known for wittily ghoulish ingenuity, once again produce Mr. Selick's work. Conceptual design comes from Lane Smith, much admired as the cutting-edge illustrator of children's books; much of this film's design resembles Mr. Smith's other images. And the score is by Randy Newman, the great and witty misanthrope who has somehow adapted himself to the Disney ethos. Mr. Newman, whose ""Toy Story"" score was more effortlessly pleasant, is better suited to puncturing platitudes than to forcing good cheer. Together, this prodigiously clever group has come up with expert animated effects and some boldly beautiful sights unlike anything else on screen: the sight of the peach being pulled by a flight of sea gulls through a starry sky, for example. The airborne middle section of the film is filled with such memorable visions, but it takes a lot to send ""James and the Giant Peach"" afloat. A long, sour live-action prologue must be endured first, with Mr. Selick appearing to adopt the style of Ken Russell telling a campfire tale. The story's opening is about how an orphan named James (Paul Terry) is abused by his two mean, tarted-up aunts (Joanna Lumley and Miriam Margolyes), who gloat while saddling James with miserable chores. In the dungeonlike atmosphere of their household, James's only friend is a spider, whose presence augurs things to come. When at long last a mysterious old man (Pete Postlethwaite) hands James a bag of magic crocodile tongues, the boy accidentally drops these near the aunts' fruit tree. And on the tree grows a huge peach that becomes James's salvation. As James climbs into the peach, he changes alarmingly into a stop-motion replica of himself. Now James has a huge head, pinhole eyes, Medusa's hair and a new group of chatty insect friends. Enlarged along with the peach are a stogie-chomping Centipede (with the voice of Richard Dreyfuss), a slinky Russian spider with two green irises in each eye (Susan Sarandon), an erudite English grasshopper (Simon Callow), a Cockney earthworm (David Thewlis) and a matronly Ladybug (Jane Leeves). Happily welcoming James, they sing and dance about eating and friendship and wanting to visit New York City. Sure this is cute, but it doesn't offset the facts that the peach is dank and claustrophobic and James's new buddies are giant bugs. There's a palpable relief when, nearly half an hour into the film, the animated James crawls out to see blue sky. During this impressive action-adventure segment of the story, the peach's crew harnesses sea gulls by using spider webs (Ms. Sarandon's insect character is easily the charmer of the group) and battles a missile-firing mechanical shark. There's also an undersea episode featuring a quick appearance from Jack Skellington, the ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" hero. Like that film, this one is stronger on design ingenuity than on storytelling. And it doesn't help that Mr. Dahl's chatty, whimsical book offers few real guidelines. The book is cinematic only in its idea of a huge peach and a voyage through the sky, where Mr. Dahl's James finds out how hailstones and rainbows are made. The film drops these weather-related scenes and substitutes battle scenes that for all their dazzle have less magic. The arrival of the peach in New York City is, like much of the film, several shades more grotesque than Mr. Dahl's version. So anyone tempted to bring a small child to this film because of its Disney pedigree and huge pastel fruit could well wind up answering some unexpected questions. Why does the giant special-effects storm-cloud rhino make the peach have a plane crash? Wouldn't it be nasty if a giant peach drippe' gunk from the top of the Empire State Building? When the peach is devoured by the crowd, is that like ""Suddenly, Last Summer?"" Can singing bug friends really make up for the fact that the rhino ate Mom and Dad?""James and the Giant Peach"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes brief violence and occasional ghoulish effects that could bother young children.

‘If the Dancer Dances’ Review: An Inheritance in Motion - The New York Times,"which is two-dimensional — could never capture dance movements as specific as Merce Cunningham’s. “History and preservation has to happen skin to skin, breath to breath, body to body,” the choreographer Stephen Petronio says toward the end of the film, a gratifyingly hands-on backstage chronicle of his company’s efforts to revive Cunningham’s “RainForest” in 2015. For Petronio, the endeavor demands doing right by a famous piece (with a set by Andy Warhol and costumes by Jasper Johns) and by Cunningham, an artist he considers a crucial influence. For the dancers, used to the kinetic motion of Petronio’s productions, it means learning a new and unintuitive way of moving, following precise directions from dancers who knew Cunningham, who died in 2009. Andrea Weber, the official stager from the Merce Cunningham Trust, is exacting in making sure everything looks just so. The film’s director, Maia Wechsler, is attuned enough to the details that even viewers without the faintest grasp of dance technique — picture my hand sheepishly raised — will gain a strong sense of what made Cunningham’s work groundbreaking. As Wechsler allows rehearsal scenes to play out at length, the perfectionism of dancer-to-dancer lessons becomes improbably poignant. The film shows that preserving choreography is difficult not only because muscle memories can’t be handed down like recipes, but because dancing in the present almost by definition means letting go of the past.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/movies/if-the-dancer-dances-review.html
"Review: Revisiting a Film from Ida Lupino, Hollywood Star Turned Director - The New York Times","the story of a young dancer felled by polio — was Lupino’s coming-out as a director. It was also the first title made under the banner of the Filmakers, the company that Lupino formed with her husband, Collier Young, and the writer Malvin Wald (“The Naked City”). Unsatisfied with the roles she had been offered, Lupino turned to making movies, saying it gave her “the freedom to call my own shots.” Her company had financial growing pains, though, and “Never Fear” (later retitled “The Young Lovers”) may not have opened in New York (which is why I’m reviewing it now). On Friday, a terrific restoration will screen as part of the Museum of Modern Art’s annual To Save and Project festival of film preservation. “Never Fear” takes off just as the dance partners Carol (Sally Forrest, a Lupino discovery) and Guy (Keefe Brasselle) are about to debut their latest routine at a Los Angeles-area supper club. Their inaugural number, a cornily amusing romantic duet-duel with clattering swords, proves that they have what the audience wants. Not long after, Carol falls ill — soon she can’t walk unassisted — and learns she has polio. Her father (Herbert Butterfield) secures her a private room in a rehabilitation center, where much of the story takes place. There, Carol struggles physically and psychologically, pushing and pulling at Guy and endangering their future dreams. Written by Lupino and Young, “Never Fear” is a tough-minded, modest, yet memorable film about a profound existential struggle. The arc of its rehabilitation narrative is largely familiar; it was released amid a clutch of movies about disabled veterans like “The Men” (1950), Marlon Brando’s big-screen debut. For inspiration, Lupino drew on a physiotherapist she had known at the real rehab center where the movie was set, the Kabat-Kaiser Institute in Santa Monica, Calif. She also probably borrowed from her life, having contracted polio when she was 16 and under contract at Paramount. (Because of a set accident during “Never Fear,” she directed from a wheelchair.)“Never Fear” has an attractive no-frills look that fits the story and its modesty, and is in keeping with Lupino’s embrace of documentary realism. Working with a cast that includes actual patients and largely avoiding glamour (except in the hair and makeup), she whittles the story down to basics and mainly focuses on the rehabilitation and Carol’s emotions. Although never less than sympathetic, Carol isn’t picture perfect; she doesn’t suffer beautifully or pacifically. She frets and fights, and lashes out at Guy and often at herself. She also starts a needy flirtation with another patient, Len (a suave Hugh O’Brian in the film’s strongest performance), whom she clings to as her worries about her progress escalate. Much of “Never Fear” unfolds indoors, which gives it a claustrophobic quality that dovetails with Carol’s sense of feeling trapped, and comes out in jolts of anger, panic and self-pity. Perhaps it’s no surprise that Lupino, a tough number — and a memorable, complicated presence in noirs like “High Sierra” — has little patience for Carol’s despair. The movie’s attitude toward its protagonist is fiercely devoid of sentimentalism and, at times, flat-out disapproving. In one bracing scene, Carol, now in a wheelchair, shrieks “I’m a cripple!” at Guy, an explosion that provokes a withering rebuke from two lovers, one a man on crutches who firmly puts that self-pity in its place. Forrest and Brasselle are never quite as good as you want them to be, though both have their moments, especially when their characters are most tightly wound. (From some angles and in certain lights, Forrest can resemble Lupino, who cast her in other films.) Some of the more haunting performances happen around the edges: The look of contempt that the woman with the man on crutches gives Carol resonates long after the scene has ended, deepening the story’s emotional colors. And an aching sequence with Guy and another woman, a would-be fling (a touching Eve Miller), condenses a movie’s worth of adult desire and regret into the melancholy that settles in her face. “Never Fear” is sprinkled with scenes shot outdoors that deepen its textured realism, including a picnic for the patients, their friends and others. (While Lupino was directing her first film, she admiringly spoke about the neorealist god Roberto Rossellini.) Here, as elsewhere, Lupino underscores the ordinariness of these men and women, some of whom are in wheelchairs while others relax next to them. She matter-of-factly conveys disability in intimate moments of rehabilitation — in close-ups of Carol’s body moving and being coaxed to move — and when she goes big and wide for an exuberant square dance in which the revelers do-si-do in wheelchairs, joyously independent.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/movies/never-fear-the-young-lovers-review.html
"Review: ‘Virus of Fear,’ a Kiss Touches Off Child Abuse Accusations - The New York Times","child sexual abuse — as it weighs a man’s possible innocence against a mob’s rage. But its attempts at ambiguity work against it. Fortunately, the film, adapted from Josep Maria Miró’s play “Archimedes’ Principle,” falls on the right side of its issue, if barely. Jordi (Rubèn de Eguia) is a swimming instructor at a sports center in Barcelona, Spain, whose behavior is questioned when a girl reports he has given a boy a kiss. Jordi’s manager, Anna (a very fine Roser Batalla), wants to believe his anguished self-defense (he says he was trying to quell the child’s fears of the water), but his lies (about smoking) and exhibitionism (at one point he angrily confronts Anna in the nude) make her suspicious. His low-key fellow instructor, Hector (Albert Ausellé), has growing doubts, as does the center’s receptionist, Laura (Diana Gómez). Exacerbating matters is a recent unrelated pedophilia scandal in the city, which has helped feed a growing chorus of livid parents. One detail is conveniently unexplored: Laura socializes with Jordi outside of work, but we never learn what he’s like in civilian life. Shots of Jordi’s students are laden with uncertainty; at times, they look capable of malicious invention. But Mr. de Eguia’s overheated performance — often embodying a boorish macho insolence — doesn’t help Jordi’s case. And while the story avoids a glib resolution, its suggestion that parental concerns over this issue can be overstated rings false. Sometimes it is infinitely better to err on the side of caution.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/movies/review-virus-of-fear-a-kiss-touches-off-child-abuse-accusations.html
"In ‘A Master Builder,’ Wallace Shawn Adapts Ibsen’s Play - The New York Times","As both an actor and a playwright, Wallace Shawn, at his most audacious, goes for the jugular, but in sneaky roundabout ways. In “A Master Builder,” a filmed version of Henrik Ibsen’s play “The Master Builder,” which he also freely adapted, Mr. Shawn stars as the despicable title character, Halvard Solness. As is his wont, Mr. Shawn employs insidious sleight of hand to score moral points. Halvard may not be a murderer, but he relishes crushing the hopes and dreams of everyone around him. In traditional portrayals, Halvard is an imperious architectural eminence who strikes awe and fear into the hearts of those in his orbit. As played by the decidedly unglamorous Mr. Shawn, Halvard is a megalomaniacal little creep without an iota of majesty. Rotund and beady eyed, he exudes a superficial joviality that cannot camouflage a scheming, paranoid control freak who wields power with impunity. He has enough glimmerings of conscience to know what he’s doing and to admit his guilt. Lechery and probably pedophilia in his younger days are the least of the sins committed by a man who has the soul of a modern dictator driven by a lust for unchecked authority, even as he lies dying in the film’s opening scenes. His imminent death, although not in Ibsen’s play, lends the drama an extra urgency. Halvard knows it is his last chance to do the right thing and anoint a successor. But will he? It is a race against time. The obvious candidate is his assistant Ragnar (Jeff Biehl), a talented architect whose career ascent he has cruelly thwarted for fear of competition. Ragnar is the son of Halvard’s mentor, Knut (André Gregory), a servile shadow of his former self whom Halvard also superseded. Adding to the humiliation, Halvard has been conducting a long-term affair with Ragnar’s fiancée, Kaya (Emily Cass McDonnell), who works slavishly as Halvard’s bookkeeper and answers his every beck and call. Jonathan Demme, who directed “A Master Builder” in the flat minimalist style of a filmed play, has described his concept as “an old-fashioned haunted house movie.” The production was created for the stage by Mr. Shawn’s longtime collaborator, Mr. Gregory (with whom he starred in “My Dinner With André”), and developed over a 14-year period. The story focuses on a mysterious young woman’s out-of-the-blue visit to Halvard’s mansion. The unannounced guest, Hilde (Lisa Joyce), who materializes like the angel of death, is a radiant, 22-year-old beauty he barely remembers but who claims they met 10 years earlier when he made promises he can’t recall. Whether or not they had sex back then remains unclear, but there was almost certainly “inappropriate touching,” to use current terminology. Exactly 10 years ago, Hilde declares, Halvard invited her to come live with him and be his princess. Having counted the days ever since, she is now on his doorstep ready to claim her crown. Playing a woman who is part angel and part witch who stands up to Halvard, Ms. Joyce is a seductive, forceful screen presence. The drab country mansion where Halvard and his followers gather has the feel of a dingy mausoleum where everyone except for Hilde nervously tiptoes around the great man. Halvard’s wife, Aline (Julie Hagerty), is a spectral presence eaten up by jealousy and bitterness with a crust of moral self-righteousness. She seems in a state of perpetual mourning for their two children, who died as infants. Decades earlier, Aline’s family home mysteriously burned to the ground with all its possessions. A replacement home on the same site nearby, designed by Halvard and crowned with a big tower, is in the final stages of construction. The screenplay insinuates that Halvard was to blame for the fire and the children’s deaths, but such thoughts are never voiced. There is something demonic about Hilde, whom Aline loathes on sight. Has she come to curse Halvard or to save his soul? When, toward the end, Halvard makes tentative efforts at reconciliation with those he has hurt, it may be too little, too late, but at least it is a gesture. Despite his weakened condition and fear of heights, Halvard voices his intention to climb the tower and overcome his acrophobia. That determination is the ultimate indication of his difficulty surrendering control and acknowledging that he is less than superhuman.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/movies/in-a-master-builder-wallace-shawn-adapts-ibsens-play.html
"‘Nothing Left to Fear,’ a Horror Tale by Anthony Leonardi III - The New York Times","or something otherwise Hell-like. Dan Bramford (James Tupper of “Revenge”) and his wife, Wendy (Anne Heche), want only to assimilate into their congregation. But their adolescent daughters have boys on their minds, and that, of course, means jeopardy. Rebecca (Rebekah Brandes) is teased by her younger sister, Mary (Jennifer Stone from the Disney Channel’s “Wizards of Waverly Place”), about her flirtation with the field hunk Noah (Ethan Peck, a grandson of Gregory Peck’s). But soon Mary has her own distractions, like spitting blood after biting down on an ancient claw nail hidden in a neighbor’s cake. And then downing a spiked drink at the town’s summer festival, which brings out her spidery, greasy-haired, soul-sucking inner monster. These events, and the predatory rampage that follows, are not things the welcoming committee, led by a retiring pastor (Clancy Brown), warned about. The familiar special effects are not the most disappointing element here. It’s the squandering of the talented Ms. Heche, who is given top billing but almost nothing to do. Ms. Brandes has charm, but Ms. Stone deserves the most credit, if only for her stamina under a mountain of makeup. “Nothing Left to Fear” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for naughty language and mild violence.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/movies/nothing-left-to-fear-a-horror-tale-by-anthony-leonardi-iii.html
Private Fears in Public Places - Movie - Review - The New York Times,"son, colleague, sibling and lover — that at once define and restrict them. Despite the obvious personal and social perks, the private love and the public profile, playing the same role for too long can, the film suggests, take a toll. That much at least seems true from the creased, crumpled face of Lionel, who for too many years has performed the part of the dutiful son, faithfully caring for the invalid father who has become as much his warden as his ward. In the early 1960s Mr. Resnais’s “Last Year at Marienbad” inspired head-scratching among critics and audiences, attracting the kind of attention in the press now usually reserved for celebrity scandals and box-office receipts. These days, difficult films — it seems important to add that difficult is not a pejorative — rarely elicit anything but yawns and condescension. “Private Fears in Public Places” is far from difficult and that, it is also worth noting, is not a criticism. The film is accessible, pleasant, dreamy, a touch goofy and melancholic. Its modernist gestures are little more than stylistic tics, but there’s an image of snow falling on two clasped hands that is almost rapturous. The role of the artist remains, for Mr. Resnais, the role of a lifetime. PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACESOpens today in Manhattan and on Video on Demand.

Fearless - Jet Li - Review - Movies - The New York Times,"Whether or not Jet Li has retired from the martial arts movie, as he recently announced, “Fearless” may come to be remembered as a late specimen in a different genre: the China-as-underdog flick. For the moment, the notion of a Chinese freedom fighter defending the honor of his nation against a seven-foot Yankee muscleman named Hercules O’Brien (Nathan Jones) remains more or less credible. But tomorrow? Such narratives may lose their punch when China rules the universe. Set at the turn of the previous century, as imagined through state-of-the-art production values (the film keeps one eye on old-school chopsocky and the other on new-school superproductions), “Fearless” breaks into three neat acts, each of them charmingly anachronistic. In the first, the legendary martial artist Huo Yuanjia (Mr. Li) aspires to be the champion of Tianjin street fighting. His hubris, however, leads to retaliation from a rival, and a tragic turn of events sends Huo into self- imposed exile in the country. The following lovely, lyrical stretch of the picture is devoted to his spiritual rehabilitation (cue meditative farming montages), a resting of the muscles before they’re called back into service against the enemies of Tianjin. Naturally, Act 3 largely consists of Mr. Li meting Tumbling Fist, Eagle Claw Boxing and Righteous Indignation, against multiple opponents. Ably directed by Ronny Yu, a veteran of Hong Kong cinema (“The Bride With White Hair”) who has taken unfortunate steps into Hollywood (“Freddy vs. Jason”) as well as sprightly ones (“Bride of Chucky”), “Fearless” sustains the tradition of ethically inflected Chinese action movies. Physical kinesis is inseparable from spiritual dynamism; the question is not whether Hou can beat everyone to a pulp, but whether he can do so with proper discipline and honor. “Fearless” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for virtuoso bone breaking. FEARLESSOpens today nationwide. Directed by Ronny Yu; written (in Mandarin and English, with English subtitles) by Chris Chow and Christine To; director of photography, Poon Hang Sang; edited by Virginia Katz and Richard Learoyd; music by Shigero Umebayashi; production designer, Kenneth Mak; action choreography by Yuen Wo Ping; produced by Mr. Yu, Bill Kong and Jet Li; released by Rogue Pictures.

Borders and barriers, both physical and emotional, are the subject of two hourlong documentaries that open today as a double bill at the Anthology Film Archives in the East Village.''Area K: A Political Fishing Documentary'' examines the separate peace that reigned for a decade between Israeli authorities and Palestinian fisherman in a section of the Mediterranean off the Gaza Strip. Fishermen from the Shati refugee camp formed a partnership with Israelis living in the Dugit settlement on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians provided the labor and fishing expertise while the Israelis dealt with police officials, permits and taking the fish to market. Filmed by its directors, Nadav Harel and Ramon Bloomberg, from April 1999 to March 2001, ''Area K'' draws a portrait of professional and personal collaboration between Israelis and Palestinians that transcends politics. As a Palestinian boatman says: ''The fisherman wants to fish without the military telling them, here you can fish, here you cannot. The fisherman knows no borders.''This hopeful situation was shattered in 2000 by the Palestinian uprising. Suddenly guns appear and gates descend, and the Palestinian fishermen are sent back to their camps. The filmmakers allow the empty beaches to speak for themselves; rhetoric is unnecessary. There is little but rhetoric, however, in ''Frontiers of Dreams and Fears,'' a manipulative study of the long-distance friendship between two Palestinian girls. Mona, 13, lives in the Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, where her family was sent after losing its land in 1948. Manar, 14, is a resident of the Dheisha camp near Bethlehem. Both members of the Ibdaa Cultural Center, the young women exchange letters and photographs, but are prevented from meeting by border regulations. As directed by Mai Masri, ''Frontiers of Dreams and Fears'' is very heavy on heart-rending close-ups of suffering children. It is impossible not to be moved by imagery such as this, and also impossible not to feel somewhat used by it. ''Why are we studying?'' one child proclaims in voice-over, an attitude that the filmmaker appears to endorse. ''We have no future.'' But surely, in the complex context of the Middle East, this sort of sentimental passivity is an indulgence no one can afford.

FILM REVIEW; A Web Site That Puts Horror in Your Head - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from August 30, 2002, Section E, Page 26Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Somewhere buried in the rain-washed blue-black murk of ''fear dot com'' is a lean and nasty little horror film struggling to be born. In the movie that might have been, a Web site on the Internet has acquired a malevolent intelligence that beams demonic energy into those who visit it and stimulates their worst nightmares. Over the next two days, they are gripped by escalating terror and eventually die of fright. In the most effective of the movie's death scenes, a woman who is scared of cockroaches visits the site and soon begins envisioning swarms of the little critters taking over her apartment and invading her body. Gripped by panic, she leaps to her death. The cyber hostess of this Web site, www.feardotcom.com, is a seductive Joan Crawford-Sharon Stone hybrid who purrs the invitation, ''Do you like to watch?'' as though she were beckoning the visitor to observe a kinky orgy. But what we see through the characters' eyes is a frantically busy, mildly jarring montage of semi-abstract horror images, hyped by sound effects, hissing wires and flashing lights. The movie apparently wants to say something about voyeurism and shame in cyberspace, but it loses the point. Directed by William Malone from a screenplay by Josephine Coyle, ''fear dot com,'' which opens nationwide today, is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense; during the last half hour of the preview screening I attended, the audience lost its patience and began jeering and laughing. The gist of the movie is an interminable, ineptly written detective story in which Stephen Dorff and Natascha McElhone play a police detective and a health researcher investigating some mysterious deaths. What is initially thought to be an outbreak of the Ebola virus (because the victims bleed from their eyes) is pieced together into a pattern that prompts both Mr. Dorff's and Ms. McElhone's characters to visit the Web site and risk suffering the consequences. It is painful to watch an actor as skillful as Mr. Dorff reduced to delivering flat repetitive dialogue that would make any actor look foolish, while Ms. McElhone simply walks through her role in an expressionless daze. As the mad scientist who masterminded the horror, Stephen Rea adopts the most sensible approach and shamelessly camps it up, delivering his lines in a dry, creepy monotone. How else could an actor negotiate lines like: ''How enticing the smell of cheap perfume can be. Or is that fear?'' Or ''You suffer from the hero's curse of hope.'' And finally (with an approving sneer): ''Joseph Stalin said the death of one person is a tragedy. The death of millions is a statistic.'' Mr. Rea's fiendish character is the designer of the horrors to be glimpsed on the Web site. And what might most of those horrors be? The torture, maiming and dismemberment of pretty women, of course. If you're looking for evidence that sadistic misogyny isn't dead in Hollywood, ''fear dot com'' is just your ticket.''Fear dot com'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It is quite gory and has scenes of torture. FEAR DOT COMDirected by William Malone; written by Josephine Coyle, based on a story by Moshe Diamant; produced by Mr. Diamant and Limor Diamant; director of photography, Christian Sebaldt; edited by Alan Strachan; music by Nicholas Pike; production designer, Jérôme Latour; released by Warner Brothers Pictures/MDP Worldwide.

FILM REVIEW; Terrorism That's All Too Real - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from May 31, 2002, Section E, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.''The Sum of All Fears,'' which imagines the detonation by terrorists of a nuclear bomb on American soil, couldn't have been better timed to coincide with the country's jittery mood. It was just days ago that United States officials suggested that suicide bombings are inevitable on American targets. And as the film's fictional depiction of events leading up to a small nuclear blast (in Baltimore) unfolded at a recent press screening, the audience sat riveted in silence. It's a striking measure of the nervousness of the country right now that a movie so full of holes should be as gripping as it is, at least for its first two-thirds, after which it collapses into a swamp of sentimental mush. Adapted from Tom Clancy's 1991 novel of the same name, the film, which opens nationwide today, was begun well before Sept. 11. Its far-fetched scenario, updated to the present by the director Phil Alden Robinson and the screenwriters Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne, seems at once old hat, insufficient and foolish. The villains aren't Islamic suicide bombers or home-grown terrorists but a safely hateful and cartoonish coalition of European neo-Nazis whose ludicrous scheme to restore the glories of the Third Reich involves engineering a misunderstanding between the United States and Russia that precipitates a nuclear war. After the radioactive dust settles, presumably, Fascism will rise again. But how? And out of what? A Europe that has resisted being drawn into the war and avoided catastrophic nuclear contamination?Amid the frantic diplomacy that takes place before and after the blast, the only two world leaders who appear to be involved in a crisis of global dimensions are those of the United States and Russia. And when the nuclear blast wipes out a section of Baltimore, a disaster that is many times worse than the events of Sept. 11, it is so anticlimactic it seems almost shrugged off in a way that such an event would never be in actuality. That nuclear device is a small bomb manufactured in the United States in 1968 that disappeared in a plane crash and is dug up more than three decades later in a Middle Eastern desert. Sold to the neo-Nazis, it is overhauled by a team of renegade Russian scientists and smuggled into Baltimore Harbor the day the president attends a football game in the city.''The Sum of All Fears'' resurrects Jack Ryan, the hero of earlier Clancy novels who over the course of those books ascended from a young C. I. A. analyst to the agency's directorship and finally to the American presidency. Although the film's setting is contemporary, Jack (Ben Affleck) is now a miraculously young 28-year-old scholar who has just joined the agency. His youth having been restored, this apparently immortal character is all set to be promoted upward in a whole new cycle of Jack Ryan political thrillers. The choice of Mr. Affleck, who succeeds Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford, to play Mr. Clancy's world-saving hero is not a happy one. Although Mr. Affleck can be appealing when playing earnest young men groping toward maturity, he simply lacks the gravitas for the role. It's only in the early scenes that Mr. Affleck's inner gawkiness serves a character who has yet to learn the agency's elaborate hierarchal etiquette. Jack, it turns out, knows more than anyone about the career and political philosophy of the newly installed Russian president, Alexander Nemerov (Ciaran Hinds), a dark horse who Jack believes is not as hawkish as he might appear. As the elite of American intelligence debates how to react to Russia's latest aggression in Chechnya, Jack is rushed by his mentor, William Cabot (Morgan Freeman), the director of central intelligence, into the inner circle to give his input. With his weary poker face and wry taciturnity, Mr. Freeman's director embodies the gravitas that by the middle of the film should rub off on his protégé but doesn't. Once Jack springs into action, Mr. Affleck, whose slack features convey the clueless petulance of a superannuated frat boy bluffing his way into the big leagues, loses his grip. The actor can't begin to match Mr. Ford's taut, laser-eyed combination of galvanized paranoia and patriotic zeal. Mr. Affleck ambles through several stagy, irrelevant action sequences shoehorned into the movie for their tinny melodrama. Especially in a scene where Jack drives into the burning shell of Baltimore and faces down a terrorist, his wooden performance only points up the surrounding fakery, with its carefully managed fires. Despite Mr. Affleck's dramatic flabbiness, the first two-thirds of the film skillfully sets up its dramatic dominoes. The back-and-forth scenes of emergency colloquies in the Kremlin and the White House, in which the hawks and doves on both sides (the Russians are subtitled) frantically press their agendas, generate a crackling tension. And the glossy catalog of aircraft and missiles being primed for action makes for an impressively chilly display of hardware. The movie does a crisp, evenhanded job of humanizing the Bush-like American president, Fowler (James Cromwell). You sense his frustration as he absorbs his advisers' barrage of opinions. And as the likelihood of nuclear war increases and he nervously gives the thumbs-up to take things to the next step, you share his bitter awareness of being trapped in a no-win situation. The inadequacies of ''The Sum of All Fears,'' in the light of Sept. 11, suggest that if the political thriller is to remain a vital genre, a new, toughened-up realism is necessary. Neo-Nazis no longer suffice as villainous sitting ducks, and Hollywood may finally have to come to grips with the real issues that can't be reduced to black-and-white caricatures.''The Sum of All Fears'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has violence, disaster images and strong language.

FILM REVIEW; Taking a Ride Around the Writer's Block - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from July 13, 2000, Section E, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.''Fear of Fiction,'' the first film from the director Charlie Ahearn since his 1982 high-velocity documentary ''Wild Style,'' explodes with colors and random thoughts. He works to weave coincidence, twins, faith and the nourishing blast of 60's proto punk -- garage bands with the keening Farfisa organ solos that you can't shake from your head -- into the fabric of a road picture. But he doesn't quite bring it off. The grafts won't take. This is the journey of Sigrid Andersson (Melissa Leo), an almost novelist. She's still working on her opus, ''Fear of Fiction,'' and at the beginning of the movie she goes blank while giving a reading. To clear her head she decides to take a road trip and answers the ad of Red (Sam Trammell), who's driving across the country. Moments after they start, they pick up Red's identical twin brother, Tom (also played by Mr. Trammell), and the looniness begins. Sigrid is twice Red's age, but that doesn't stop her from acting just as childishly. Given to tantrums when she can't have what she wants -- like a cigarette, since the smoke makes Red sick -- she's working her way up to diva status. Red and Tom separate, and the brothers end up in different cars but on the same path. Tom hitchhikes and is picked up by Gary (Clark Johnson), who stopped just short of taking his priestly vows, and later by Albert (Penn Jillette), a motormouth obsessed with garage bands. A big man with huge hands wrapped around a tiny steering wheel, Albert riffs on music as intensely as he drives. He and Tom start bouncing off the walls of the car with the help of Albert's stash, and their drug-addled rap about relative time and speed is a howl and feels real. Mr. Jillette's gig as a performer is to pull everyone else along with him; he has his own gravitational field. ''Fabulous Failures, a moniker all punk bands should aspires to,'' he sputters about his favorite group. (The music of the fictional Failures is by Evan Lurie, with an assist from Mr. Ahearn and Lee Ranaldo, though actual 60's garage bands like ? and the Mysterians are also on the soundtrack.)Whenever outsiders join the main characters, ''Fiction'' becomes likably trippy. Tom is also picked up by a pair of stoners, Liz (Linda Larkin) and Debbie (Annie Giobbe). ''I'm looking for someone who looks just like me, my twin,'' he explains from the back seat. Liz asks, ''How do we know you're not him?''Such moments aside, ''Fiction,'' which opens today at the Pioneer Theater at Two Boots in the East Village, is a shambles, aspiring to philosophical trajectories it couldn't possibly reach and amateurish enough that one gets lost trying to decide what is supposed to be funny. The movie isn't involving enough to make anyone care about the blurring of truth and fantasy that may, or may not, be taking place. The spiritual murk has a few high points. There's a stunning underwater rescue that could be a swim in velvety blue amniotic fluids. For the most part, though, despite glimmers of ability from Mr. Ahearn, ''Fear of Fiction'' is a washout.

FILM REVIEW; A Devotedly Drug-Addled Rampage Through a 1971 Vision of Las Vegas - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from May 22, 1998, Section E, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. In the teeming lobby of a Las Vegas hotel, the face of a woman behind the reservations desk warps, her features spilling across her face like a clown mask. As the camera pans around the plush, dimly lighted room crowded with hard-shelled tourists sipping cocktails, they suddenly turn into a sinister convention of lizards smacking their lipless mouths and casting conspiratorial glances. Conversations decompose into animalistic growls while the bland piped-in voice of Robert Goulet singing ''My Love Forgive Me'' remains eerily unaltered. This scene, drawn from one of many uproarious tableaux in ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,'' Hunter S. Thompson's brilliant, ranting explosion of verbal psychedelia, has been transferred to the screen by Terry Gilliam with a fidelity to the author's hallucinatory imagery that until now seemed impossible to capture in a film. But here it is in all its splendiferous funhouse terror: the closest sensory approximation of an acid trip ever achieved by a mainstream movie and the latest example of Mr. Gilliam's visual bravura. Why then should this gaudy splat of a movie, which is so scrupulously respectful of its source, convey so little visceral energy that when it's over you may feel like shrugging your shoulders?Revisiting Mr. Thompson's 1971 book, the enthusiastic full-tilt stamina of the author's alter ego, Raoul Duke, and his lawyer and partner-in-mayhem, Dr. Gonzo, is still infectious in its dated way. As they roar through Las Vegas like a pair of runaway trains, nothing derails them, even when the surrounding landscape seems to shatter into ghoulish hallucinatory shards. The drugs they consume by the fistful seem to work as physical as well as psychic fuel for their outrageous drug-addled investigation of the garish side of the American dream at a moment when the world seems divided into two mutually hostile camps: the insolent hip and the grimly square. But in the movie, the story of how Raoul (Johnny Depp) and his sidekick (Benicio Del Toro) travel to Las Vegas to cover a motorbike race for Sports Illustrated and get phantasmagorically sidetracked has been so rigidly compressed that its vignettes all bleed together into an overstuffed cinematic hodgepodge that adds up to far less than the sum of its parts. Yes, the details are accurate. But where the book conveyed a spirit of open-ended adventure in which each new caper could be spun out into its own little movie, the film rarely gives the book's appallingly funny anecdotes room to breathe. The film is clumsily anchored in a narration (by Donald Morrow) whose mock-heroic tone is faithful to the self-caricaturing attitude of Mr. Thompson's reportorial alter ego. But hearing this voice in the fragmentary spiels that are used to splice scenes together is a far different experience from hearing it shouting and guffawing uninterruptedly in your head as you read the book. Without that voice relentlessly goading you with the speed-rapping intensity of a great stand-up comedian on a roll, one scene after another in the movie falls flat. Even the most precise cinematic realizations of Mr. Thompson's images (and of Ralph Steadman's cartoon drawings for the book) don't begin to match the surreal ferocity of the author's language. The motorbike race barely registers. The depiction of a national convention of district attorneys veers uncertainly between grotesque satire and ineffectual parody. Dr. Gonzo's perilous relationship with Lucy (Christina Ricci), an underage teen-ager peddling her awful drawings of Barbra Streisand, becomes an unfocused throwaway bit, its paranoia diluted. In the strongest scene, which comes late in the film, Dr. Gonzo insults a waitress (Ellen Barkin) in a greasy spoon who quickly regrets standing up to him. Brandishing a knife, the lawyer reduces the poor woman to a speechless, quivering wreck. The scene is ugly enough to cast a moral shadow over the preceding fun and games and make you dislike these selfish rampaging hipsters who have spent the best part of the movie stoned out of their gourds, trashing hotel rooms and intimidating the help. Outfitted in tinted aviator glasses and an array of safari hats, a cigarette continually dangling from his lips, Mr. Depp, who has been made partly bald for the role of Raoul, turns in a clever stunt performance. But because a different actor narrates the story, Mr. Depp's largely nonverbal role seems more like a pantomime than a three-dimensional portrait. Mr. Del Toro's Dr. Gonzo is a more substantial performance in its transcendently boorish way. In one of the grossest scenes, the stoned-out, gun-waving ''attorney'' wallows in a garbage-filled bathtub like an enraged baby elephant roaring and snorting incoherently and threatening Raoul's life. Now of course we all know how the ''hip'' drug culture of the 60's and 70's deteriorated into a crack epidemic that devastated America's cities and destroyed countless thousands of lives. While the movie keeps the book's most lyrical riff, a nostalgic, incense-heavy evocation of the euphoric vibes of San Francisco in the heady days of hippie culture, the movie doesn't make the mistake of attempting a full-scale reconstruction of the myth of ''hip.''But in refusing to cling to the book's quaint cocksure attitude, the film really has no attitude at all. For all of Mr. Thompson's intimations of the failure of the drug culture to save the world, his book still promoted a righteously hip us-against-them agenda in which the Rolling Stones, Buffalo Springfield and Janis Joplin were the cheerleaders for the good guys. And the Las Vegas version of the American dream (and the sanitized kitsch culture of the Lennon Sisters, Perry Como and Debbie Reynolds singing ''Tammy'' that was its sunnier aspect) was the enemy. As we all know now, it was never that simple.''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of drug-taking and strong language.

FILM REVIEW; Once a Fear Beyond Fear Itself - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from March 4, 1998, Section E, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.''My name is virus poliomyelitis,'' intones a cultivated, sinister male voice, as a camera pans over fair-weather clouds from which a hollow shadow emerges carrying the silhouette of a crutch. ''I consider myself quite an artist, a sort of sculptor,'' the voice continues. ''I specialize in grotesques, twisting and deforming human bodies. That's why I'm called The Crippler.''This vintage film clip, included in Nina Gilden Seavey's absorbing documentary film, ''A Paralyzing Fear: The Story of Polio in America,'' captures with more chilling force than any dry historical account the horror and panic that the polio epidemics of the early 1950's struck in the hearts of Americans. Appearing to attack in random clusters, usually during the summer, polio killed and maimed thousands of Americans, most of them children, leaving some unable to breathe without a respirator. The film's saddest images show a hospital ward crowded with children confined in iron lungs. As the film, narrated by Olympia Dukakis, recalls, the epidemics grew steadily worse each year, with the number of new cases climbing from 5,000 in 1933 to 59,000 in 1952. Salvation came in 1954 with the Salk vaccine. Within two years after the mass vaccination of the country's schoolchildren, the incidence of polio had declined by 80 percent. The Salk vaccine, which was made from the dead polio virus, was later superseded by a more efficient live-virus vaccine, which could be ingested orally, developed by Jonas Salk's contentious rival Albert Sabin. Until these vaccines virtually eradicated polio from America, the disease had a mystique as fearsome as the Communist menace or the threat of nuclear war. The irony of the rise of polio in the 20th century, the movie reports, is that its prevalence was a result of improved sanitation. In grubbier times, babies and very young children developed antibodies to the disease, which had been around forever. A cleaner environment left increasing numbers of children with no natural immunity. The movie, which opens today at the Film Forum, skillfully weaves interviews with polio sufferers, including one woman who has lived most of her life in an iron lung, with a history of the disease in this country. Polio first struck hard in the summer of 1916, then tapered off. In August 1921, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then 39, became ill and was left with both legs paralyzed. Roosevelt, who became President in 1932, made no secret of his affliction (although photographs and films of him almost never pictured him in a wheelchair or being carried), and he turned Warm Springs, a thermal spa in Georgia, into a major polio rehabilitation center. Later it was taken over by his close friend Basil O'Connor, who would establish the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The comic actor Eddie Cantor coined the term March of Dimes (a pun on the ''March of Time'' newsreels), the name of a volunteer organization that became a national grass-roots movement to raise money for polio research and treatment and the largest private charity in history. That treatment was significantly advanced by Elizabeth Kenny (known as Sister Kenny), an Australian nurse who came to America and revolutionized polio therapy through a combination of moist heat application and repetitive exercise. Mentioned only in passing is the startling fact that the Federal Government never mounted a significant campaign to conquer the disease. The work was accomplished by private grass-roots organizations. And some of the film's most touching moments, like its recollection of the Mothers' March on Polio, illustrate a solidarity of purpose shared by millions of Americans. Although the story of the war on polio ends with a victory as resounding as the winning of World War II, the movie also reminds us that thousands are still alive who were struck by the disease. At least a dozen victims are included in the film, and their personal stories are uniformly compelling.

Occasional flashes of the maniac's bloodshot eyes and gore-smeared teeth suggest that he might turn out to be more fiendish than the average movie monster.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Surprise, surprise. Mark Wahlberg, the pug-faced actor formerly known as Marky Mark, could be on the verge of full-fledged movie stardom, embodying every father's worst nightmare of a boyfriend for his darling daughter. In ""Fear,"" he plays David McCall, a young Seattle roustabout with a shady past who becomes involved with 16-year-old Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon), a restless teen-ager who looks like Alicia Silverstone's sulky younger sister. Oozing a seductive sexual menace that Nicole finds irresistible, David is a walking invitation to disaster. With his slit eyes, working-class accent and feline stealth, Mr. Wahlberg conjures up images of the young John Garfield and Robert Ryan in their more unsavory roles, although he is much more boyish than either. Fear,"" directed by James Foley from a screenplay by Christopher Crowe, is a nasty little thriller that starts out on a somewhat higher plane but eventually trades in its level head for conventional scare tactics and violence. At least in its early scenes, the movie is a perceptive, darkly humorous examination of the tensions within an upper-middle-class family blended from two previous marriages. William Petersen is Steve Walker, Nicole's workaholic, too-often-absent but fiercely protective biological father who smells a rat when introduced to an obsequiously polite David. Amy Brenneman is Steve's second wife, Laura, who valiantly tries to knit together a picture-perfect family from two broken marriages that have left scars on both children (she has a young son, Toby, from her first marriage). Laura desperately wants to win her stepdaughter's confidence and counts it a victory when the wary Nicole casually addresses her as ""mom"" for the first time. When David enters the scene, he is a tentatively sympathetic figure. To this product of orphanages and reform schools, the Walkers' life appears as dreamy and unattainable as the world of Beaver Cleaver, and he worships his new girlfriend with an abject devotion that would be pitiable if it weren't tinged with deceit and violent possessiveness. But once David flies into a jealous rage and beats up one of Nicole's classmates, the character becomes overwhelmingly sinister, a lover who has metamorphosed into a psychopathic stalker. More accurately than most Hollywood films about white middle-class families, the movie captures a barbed, edgy tone of generational conflict and simmering rivalry. When Steve invites his daughter to a James Taylor concert, she scoffs sarcastically about the singer's baldness. She teams up with David at an ear-splitting ""rave"" concert that dissolves into a frightening brawl attended by police helicopters. The movie locates an ugly strain of sexual competition in Steve's furious loathing for David and brings it out in several vicious exchanges between the father and the boyfriend.

Back from ""First Knight"" and the Dark Ages, Richard Gere has a tailor-made role in ""Primal Fear,"" which casts him as a slick Chicago lawyer. Mr. Gere does a solid job of turning Martin Vail, a dashing, self-satisfied legal hotshot, into a character audiences will love to hate. ""When your mother says she loves you, ask for a second opinion,"" Martin tells a reporter who interviews him, smiling seductively as he dresses for a black-tie evening. ""This is a cover story, right?""Martin flaunts his success and usually enjoys finding himself in the headlines. However, what ""Primal Fear"" has in store for him are headlines worthy of a supermarket tabloid, since it involves voyeuristic sex, the grisly hacking murder of an archbishop and a suspect whose problems go beyond Martin's areas of expertise. As an assistant of Martin's says, without too much exaggeration: ""This kid doesn't need a lawyer. He needs an exorcist.""As soon as he has seen television reports of the killing, Martin races to jail and appropriates the case of Aaron Stampler, the scared young man found fleeing the scene of the crime. Aaron (played with subtle cleverness by Edward Norton, in a debut to remember) is so shy and uncertain that he brings out the unexpected in Martin. This is the old tale of the cynic who suddenly finds himself shamed into seriousness by the purity of another person. Or at least it looks that way for a while. Adapted from William Diehl's novel (part of a trilogy about Martin Vail) by Steve Shagan and Ann Biderman, ""Primal Fear"" relies on many more old ideas than that. Pared down to a farfetched plot and paper-thin motives, the story relies on an overload of tangential subplots to keep it looking busy. There is an earlier case of Martin's, involving a Hispanic community leader (Steven Bauer). There is the psychiatrist (Frances McDormand) studying Aaron's textbook-worthy symptoms. There is the State's Attorney (John Mahoney) whose close ties to the archbishop give him a more than passing interest in the case. And there is Janet Venable (Laura Linney), who once had an affair with Martin and now becomes his courtroom adversary. Sparks are meant to fly between these two, but the film doesn't make much of their romantic potential. Instead, the trial scenes concentrate on careful hairdressing and dueling Armani wardrobes, not to mention occasional dramatic revelations, which are greeted by loud gasps from the crowd. Alfre Woodard presides nicely as a seasoned, fashionable judge. Michael Chapman's cinematography gives the whole film a polished look. The director, Gregory Hoblit, has had a substantial Emmy-winning television career (his credits include the ""L. A. Law"" pilot and episodes of ""N. Y. P. D. Blue"") and sticks to a television style for his first feature. If that means glossy storytelling and one-note insights into character, it also means a good deal of surface charm. Mr. Hoblit also turns the film's closing revelation into one of its better selling points. It is a surprise here to realize that Mr. Gere could easily play Martin Vail on a weekly basis, so comfortably does he fit into this engaging role. The film's most ingratiating scenes are those of Martin bantering with his staff members, showing off sardonic humor and debonair style. ""Tommy,"" he tells a detective (played sturdily by Andre Braugher), ""you're going to have to try harder to get the word allegedly into your vocabulary, especially if you want to be a lawyer.""Intense jail-house scenes between Mr. Gere and Mr. Norton also generate heat, though Mr. Hoblit lets them run on too long. (At 2 hours 10 minutes, the whole film would have been helped by some tightening.) And there's energy to the sparring between Mr. Gere and Ms. Linney, although their characters' past history hardly makes sense. He is supposed to have been too rakish and skirt-chasing to get along with any one woman. Yet the film rarely shows him doing anything bolder than nursing a bottle of mineral water or insinuating himself beside Ms. Linney and whispering ""Wanna dance?""""Primal Fear"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes an excerpt from a pornographic videotape and glimpses of a brutal killing.

Reviews/Film; Giving the 'Spinal Tap' Treatment to Rap - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from June 3, 1994, Section C, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Flattering the daylights out of Rob Reiner and his ""Spinal Tap"" crew, Rusty Cundieff turns ""Fear of a Black Hat"" into an unapologetic ""Spinal Tap"" imitation. And there's no point in faulting Mr. Cundieff for such derivativeness, because ""Fear of a Black Hat"" is too savvy and cheerful to warrant complaints. Anyway, the more the merrier: what ""Spinal Tap"" did for heavy metal certainly deserves to be done for rap, which is the target this time. If Mr. Cundieff doesn't match the satirical genius of Mr. Reiner's film, he does understand the rules of the game. For instance, the band being studied in mock-documentary format must be publicly overconfident and privately pretty badly confused. Accompanying the group should be at least one unctuous flunky. ""I really enjoy your work, fellas,"" one white manager says to some of this film's tough-guy black rappers. ""Rich emotional tapestry.""White managers are deemed essential by the members of Niggaz With Hats, since the managers tend to get caught in crossfire and suffer other music-related mishaps. They drop like flies, just as Spinal Tap's drummers did. Niggaz With Hats consists of Tasty-Taste (Larry B. Scott), Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence) and Ice Cold (Mr. Cundieff). This group, like Spinal Tap, loves to explain the deeper meaning of its music when shutting up would be a better idea. Mr. Cundieff, who wrote and directed this film and is its funniest performer, earnestly explains why the group's name and extremely silly outfits are a subtle comment on slavery, for instance. Likewise, he can explain why the group's ""Kill Whitey"" album was unfairly tarred as racist, and point out that N. W. H.'s most sexist-sounding lyrics are actually political commentary. Not surprisingly, this group is having career problems. For instance, the three rappers turn up for a concert and find themselves billed as ""And Special Guest"" on a marquee. Beyond stringing together episodes like this, ""Fear of a Black Hat"" doesn't have any more plot than ""Spinal Tap"" did, but it does trace the familiar show-biz misadventures. So Ice Cold complains bitterly about imitators (the film's other Ices include Tray, Coffee, Water, Berg and Box). And the group switches from a white-run record company to one whose owner so shamelessly flatters N. W. H. that he brings up Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley and Malcolm X in the process. None of this helps, especially not Ice's efforts to start an acting career. In one of this film's faster, wittier sketches, Ice appears in a violent exploitation film and pauses to lecture an inner-city child about the evils of drug-dealing. The child is young enough to be in a baby carriage, but in a movie like this, he already has a beeper. Incidentally, the rappers' own stage costumes feature beepers as well as crazy hats, which owe a lot to Dr. Seuss. Tasty-Taste, the gun-crazy member of N. W. H. and the one most prone to ostentation, turns up at one concert with a full-size gold trophy hanging around his neck from a gold chain. This film's musical parodies have titles and lyrics that are mostly unprintable, often borrowing directly from specific rap hits. You don't need to know the original to get the gist or to realize that these sendups are mildly amusing rather than really devastating. After ""Spinal Tap,"" it became impossible to watch any heavy metal band with a straight face. While ""Fear of a Black Hat"" does blow the lid off certain stereotypes -- one of its toughest-looking rappers is exposed as a prep-school graduate who was once nicknamed Chip -- it's not as subversive. Nor is it as ""def chill fresh,"" as one of the film's more hopeless, rap-loving characters likes to say.""Fear of a Black Hat"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has considerable raw profanity.

Peter Weir's ""Fearless,"" adapted by Rafael Yglesias from his own novel, is a serious, confidently made film that's as singular and remote as Max Klein (Jeff Bridges), the successful San Francisco architect whose story it is. En route to Houston on a commercial airliner, Max survives a horrendous crash without a scratch, though he is profoundly changed. Moments before the plane hit the ground, while other passengers were screaming in panic, he experienced an epiphany. ""This is it,"" he told himself. ""This is the moment of your death, and I am not afraid."" He later sees himself as liberated. Having passed through death, he feels not immortal but forever freed from the fear of death.""Fearless"" is about many things: Max's increasingly strained relations with his loving wife, Laura (Isabella Rossellini), and young son, Jonah (Spencer Vrooman), who remain unenlightened in the mundane world; the hustling lawyers who show up to make big bucks after any such disaster; the specialists in post-traumatic stress disorders, who mean well but haven't a clue to what their patients have gone through. It is most effective in exploring the tentative relationship that grows up between Max and Carla Rodrigo (Rosie Perez), a young Puerto Rican mother who also survived the crash, though she lost the baby son she held in her arms. Carla has become catatonic, blaming herself for the child's death. Their therapist (John Turturro) brings Carla and Max together. While Carla's husband is seizing the chance to sue the airline for as much as the insurance company will bear (""A dead baby ought to be worth $2 million""), Carla is finding her way back to life with Max's guidance. He's able to demonstrate to her that she need not feel guilty, but he cannot help himself. At points in the movie one might think that Max ought to be left in his blessed, not quite out-of-body state. But he's dangerous. He feels so self-assured that he comes close to trying to fly off the top of a San Francisco office building unassisted. Though ""Fearless"" touches on many things, it's difficult to tell where its center is. Max isn't an immediately appealing character. He's smug without reason. His philosophical observations are dim. ""If life and death make no sense,"" he tells Carla, ""there's no reason to do anything,"" but he does do things: he helps her. For someone so out of sympathy with the world the rest of us live in, he's remarkably benign about its idiocies (except video games). Yet it's difficult to forgive him for inspiring the film's most saccharine sequence. He persuades Carla that they should go to the mall to buy Christmas presents for their dead loved ones: her baby and his dad, who died long ago, before Max could tell him that he loved him. Since there is little electricity between Max and his wife, there's not much interest in how that marriage turns out.""Fearless"" is well acted by the principals, especially by Ms. Perez, and by Tom Hulce, a lawyer who says such things as ""I know I'm awful, but . . ."" as he exults over winning even more money than he expected. Mr. Bridges does well with a difficult role. Max isn't ambiguously complex. He's ill-defined, or maybe required to exhibit more contradictory impulses simultaneously than is possible for any single actor. At times Max suggests a Christ figure, at other times a would-be dropout from life. It's difficult to fix him in the mind or the emotions. The film's physical production is quite fine. Here's a movie with a truly first-rate airplane crash, to which Max keeps returning in chronological flashbacks. The noise, the flames, the chaos and the suspension of time are beautifully caught in these scenes. They're both frightening and, reflecting Max's state of mind, eerily peaceful. The ending of ""Fearless"" makes sense without being satisfying.""Fearless"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of panic and carnage that could badly frighten small children, and some vulgar language.

Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy,"" the drag-and-drug comedy from the television-skit troupe Kids in the Hall, offers America yet another chance to continue its platonic love affair with men in dresses. This group's specialty is, quite literally, wiggy humor, since each of the five Kids plays multiple roles and four of them cross-dress with goofy abandon. As with most transvestism aimed at mainstream audiences, the effect is safely ludicrous and studiously avoids intimations of real sex. But one straight-arrow married character does get arrested in a men's room and later stars in a musical production number informing his entire suburban neighborhood that he's gay. The same actor, the impressive 5/8 ly versatile Scott Thompson, also plays a matronly old lady, a fashion model called Clemptor and the Queen of England in other scenes. The Kids in the Hall's first feature isn't anything more than a sloppy showcase for the group's costume-changing tricks, but sometimes its sheer chutzpah can be amusing. Just as often, flashes of complete plot incoherence or atrocious taste spoil the effect. The film's worst idea is a aharacter called Cancer Boy, bald and confined to a wheelchair, smiling even when a handshake hurts his hand. ""That's O. K.,"" he says bravely. ""My marrow's just low.""Directed by Kelly Makin with more ability than he brought to the nearly unreleasable ""National Lampoon's Senior Trip,"" ""Brain Candy"" is about mood-altering pills. A drug company headed by Don Roritor (an unctuous autocrat played with in-joke suavity by Mark McKinney, who's as much of a standout as Mr. Phompson) wants to mass-market the happiness-inducing pill created by Dr. Chris Cooper (Kevin McDonald). Roritor reads a trade paper called Drug Variety (""We beat penicillin!"" he exclaims) and says he wants to sell the happiness pills to improve conditions for ghetto children. ""Apparently their lives are horrible,"" he says, wearing a kimono and sashaying past his indoor swimming pool.""Brain Candy"" haphazardly piles as many skits as possible onto the idea of the new drug. Dr. Cooper is the guest on a talk show where the guests ask stupid questions and the hostess (also Mr. McKinney) soon has hi' wiggling and lip-synching to Tom Jones. A rock star (Bruce McCulloch) shakes off his depression and makes a ridiculously cheerful record. A corporate yes-man (David Foley) helps implement Roritor's schemes. And almost everybody in the film gets high sampling Dr. Cooper's invention. News that the pill has awful side-effects supposedly gives the film an anti-drug spin.

‘A Faithful Man’ Review: Low Key. Low Fidelity. - The New York Times,"his father is Philippe Garrel, a director who also specializes in autocritique — the movie delights in the spectacle of seeing the actor rendered powerless. His character, Abel, is cuckolded, manipulated and misled, but Garrel rarely deviates from his signature gaze, which makes him look adrift and slightly vacant. In the first scene, Abel’s girlfriend, Marianne (Laetitia Casta), with whom he lives as a freeloader, informs him that she is pregnant with his friend Paul’s child, and that she plans to marry Paul on the 26th. (“Of this month?” asks Abel, unruffled, considering the circumstances.) And by the way, it would be best if he moves out by then. Nearly a decade later, when the never-seen Paul drops dead, Marianne becomes available again, an opportunity that Abel hopes to seize. Marianne’s young son, Joseph (Joseph Engel), a mystery buff who uses an iPhone recorder to keep tabs on intimate goings-on in his home, suggests to Abel that Marianne has gotten away with murdering Paul — a theory that Abel investigates without ever quite resolving. Complicating matters, the funeral puts Abel back in touch with Eve (Lily-Rose Depp), Paul’s younger sister, who has nursed a crush on him for years and is prepared to announce as much to Marianne. Although Abel is the movie’s fulcrum, Marianne and Eve also participate in voice-over duties — a destabilizing choice that seems perfectly in keeping with the characters’ one-upmanship and the movie’s off-kilter comic tone. Garrel finds visual ways to emphasize a lack of balance. (Indeed, given who is holding hands in the closing scene, asymmetry may be the film’s overriding theme.)Conversations are often shot in uncomfortable close-ups, and the cinematographer Irina Lubtchansky’s unobtrusive shading hedges against the potential for talky drabness. In some respects, the film resembles Éric Rohmer’s moral tales, but amorality — all three principal characters are effectively dancing on a man’s grave — seems to be the order of the day. In this low-key, engaging comedy, a protagonist must become unfaithful to prove his fidelity — and turn selfish to prove that he cares about people beyond himself. A Faithful ManNot rated.

FILM REVIEW; Day in Town Takes an Unexpected Tryst - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from May 8, 2002, Section E, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Sex is such a profoundly disruptive force in Adrian Lyne's film ''Unfaithful'' that as you watch it with your heart in your throat, you realize the degree to which Hollywood has succeeded in reducing screen sex to a fashion accessory. Its purpose in most movies nowadays is to embellish a story with enough (but not too many) discrete fillips of titillation and soft-core fantasy to quicken the pulse without causing palpitations.''Unfaithful'' crashes through that mold by acknowledging that sex, especially reckless adulterous sex, can rock people's lives and have catastrophic consequences. The lovemaking in ''Unfaithful'' leaves deep emotional imprints. In the most extraordinary scene, Connie Sumner (Diane Lane), a beautiful, happily married suburban housewife and mother of a young son, mentally relives the details of her first extramarital tryst while taking a commuter train from Grand Central Terminal home to Westchester County. Connie is so absorbed in the memory of an encounter that has left her dazed and exhilarated that her features subtly re-enact the contortions of ecstasy, joy and trepidation she experienced during sex. It's only at this point that the film shows us the tryst, flashing back and forth between Connie's afternoon of passion and her delirious recollection. The portrait of someone unstrung by a single sexual encounter is disturbing for being so entirely convincing. Ms. Lane has the role of her career in Connie, and her indelible (and ultimately sympathetic) performance is both archetypal and minutely detailed. Connie is the embodiment of a confident supermom who seems to be in supreme control of her complicated upscale suburban life. It is precisely because she believes she can handle any situation that she foolishly surrenders to an erotic whim. But as her affair intensifies, she becomes increasingly careless and distracted and finally jealous. You sense that were she to end the affair without being caught, putting the pieces of herself back together would still be extremely difficult. In many ways ''Unfaithful,'' adapted from Claude Chabrol's film ''La Femme Infidèle,'' could be described as ''Fatal Attraction 2.'' Once again a tranquil suburban marriage is endangered by a reckless indiscretion (in big, bad New York City) that spins wildly out of control. And once again the sex is explosive and edged with violence. As in ''Fatal Attraction,'' the lovers are so besotted that when the urge overtakes them, they have sex standing up, and their frantic rutting, instead of satiety, leaves them raw and aching for more.''Unfaithful'' doesn't repeat the ''Fatal Attraction'' mistake of turning into a horror film with a pat, reassuring ending. Although this movie pays a witty, deadpan homage to the notorious bunny rabbit scene in that 1987 movie, it steers a much more ambiguous path toward a sad, surreal twilight zone of guilt and hopelessness. When Connie and her lover, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), first meet, they literally collide on the street outside his SoHo apartment on a windy day. When she trips and falls, he coaxes her upstairs to bandage her skinned knees. Connie's rescuer turns out to be a charmingly insolent French dreamboat who is staying in a borrowed apartment where he deals in rare books. Paul preaches a tantalizing live-in-the-moment philosophy that appeals to Connie because it runs so counter to her life of family responsibilities and school and charity events. Not long after their first meeting, she returns to New York to thank Paul. He puts the moves on her, and after a halfhearted struggle she succumbs. Compared with Paul, Edward (Richard Gere), Connie's devoted husband of 11 years, who runs a successful but unspecified business that involves shipping products by truck, is not especially glamorous. He is reasonably handsome and still in love with his wife, but under his apparent calm you sense a fierce watchfulness and grinding tension. When a longtime colleague announces he's leaving the company, Edward, who values loyalty above everything, takes the departure as a personal betrayal and turns on him furiously. In portraying Edward, Mr. Gere, who is now 52, has shucked off the preening narcissism of his younger days to give a performance that is remarkably devoid of vanity. In what may be the most emotionally affecting scene of Mr. Gere's screen career, Edward, having amassed damning photographic evidence of his wife's affair, visits her lover's loft and inexorably loses control. At this point the story turns into a melodrama with resemblances to ''In the Bedroom,'' although the earlier movie's investigation of violence and its impact on a white upper-middle-class couple who have considered themselves above crimes of passion cut much deeper.''Unfaithful'' has a taut, economical screenplay by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. that digs into its characters' marrow (and into the perfectly selected details of domestic life) without wasting a word. That screenplay helps to ground a film whose visual imagination hovers somewhere between soap opera and a portentous pop surrealism. Mr. Lyne's fondness for high-gloss, television-commercial-ready imagery was the most glaring flaw in his otherwise moving screen adaptation of ''Lolita.'' Here, the cinematography shamelessly fetishizes the Sumners' model-perfect home and the objects inside it. And the exaggerated windstorm that blows Connie and Paul into each other's arms is almost as pushy (and phony) a symbol as the white tornado in a cleanser commercial. As scrupulously as Ms. Lane and Mr. Gere delineate their characters, Connie and Edward emerge as an American Everycouple of a certain class and background, while Paul becomes a generic Continental rake. But as the movie darkens and becomes a desperate and not always convincing tale of crime and cover-up, ''Unfaithful'' takes Mr. Lyne into areas where he has never gone. The saddest and most unsettling element of ''Unfaithful'' is its portrayal of an affluent, articulate couple who for all their individual sensitivity can barely bring themselves to communicate on a less than superficial level. Does a successful middle-class marriage really require this amount of emotional suppression? If so, God help the institution. Even after Connie's affair is long over, and the Sumners are clinging to each other in fear and uncertainty, they cannot bring themselves to address the past. The best that Connie can manage is two words: ''I'm scared.'' She has every reason to be.''Unfaithful'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has intense sexual situations and scenes of violence.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Small and serenely peculiar, Sara Driver's ""When Pigs Fly"" summons two ghosts and a rocking chair into the life of a lonely musician. The spirits, a formidable woman (Marianne Faithfull) and a sprightly little girl (Rachael Bella), are forever linked to the chair because each of them died there, though their deaths were a century apart. The musician (Alfred Molina) isn't tied to much of anything besides his dog, a mutt who shares his master's wistful, tacky dreams of glory. Somehow the wraiths and the chair help coax the musician out of his rut. There isn't much more than that to ""When Pigs Fly,"" but Ms. Driver works hard to inflate a tiny premise. The film has a few other characters, like a go-go dancer (Maggie O'Neill) and a bullying bartender (Seymour Cassel) who figure in a mild plot about death and retribution. But mostly it concentrates on embellishments that are whimsical. Very whimsical. The two ghosts spend one scene with parts of the rocking chair strapped to their heads. So the lilting musical score by Joe Strummer, formerly of the Clash, manages to fuse strains of Irish music (for Ms. Faithfull's character, the kind of ghost who sings ""Danny Boy"") with jazz (for Mr. Molina's, who is a great jazz aficionado). And visually, as photographed enterprisingly by Robby Muller, the film quite literally undertakes flights of fancy. The musician's reverie with a piano student turns into a jazz riff as they both float over rooftops, for instance. The story's sepia ghosts appear and vanish with quaint courtliness, instead of the scare tactics of most movie spooks. Mr. Molina gamely tackles the difficult job of seeming to take this story seriously. (""Look, if this has anything to do with something I might have said about Woody Herman, I take it all back, man,"" he says, when scared by the apparitions.) Ms. Faithfull, a grande dame of a ghost, makes herself an impressively strong presence even when camera tricks leave her looking like thin air. Ms. Bella proves herself a poised young performer, and Mr. Cassel does an enthusiastically villainous turn. ""When Pigs Fly"" is slight and sometimes awkward, but the actors give it heart.""When Pigs Fly"" opens today at the Lighthouse Cinema on the Lower East Side, a relatively new showcase for revivals, short subjects and films as eccentric, chancy and marginal as this one.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Early in ""Faithful,"" there's a scene that shows off the comic touch of Paul Mazursky, who can gaze so benignly on the foibles of well-heeled neurotic types. Margaret (Cher) has been wandering about forlornly when she comes across two men (Stephen Spinella and Jeffrey Wright) vocally admiring a Rolls-Royce. ""Won't make you happy,"" she mutters, looking so miserable that one of the men hands her a $20 bill. She takes it, gets into the Rolls-Royce and drives home. But not much of the wan ""Faithful"" is as sharp-edged as that, unfortunately. This wistful three-character comedy about a marital feud is mostly flat, despite the energetic presence of Chazz Palminteri, who is its writer and one of its stars. Adapting his own play, Mr. Palminteri creates for himself another comically soulful tough guy, this time Tony, a hit man hired to dispose of Margaret on her 20th wedding anniversary. Her husband, Jack (Ryan O'Neal), plans to be elsewhere, working on his alibi. This thin and claustrophobic film, stagebound despite the big house that is its main setting, uses Mr. Palminteri's hostile outsider as the means (a la ""The Ref"") of finally settling the problems in Margaret and Jack's marriage. In its first act, Margaret and Tony are trapped together and wind up debating about fidelity, interrupted by the occasional phone call from Tony's therapist. The doctor, played amusingly by Mr. Mazursky, has weaknesses for gambling and self-help books, and he also brings out the softer side of Tony. The hit man turns out to have even more insecurities than the woman he's trying to kill. Cher makes her face a mask of woe during this part of the film and acts as intently as possible while tied to a chair. Then, during the film's latter half, she is free to fight with Jack about the predictable problems that have plagued them. Cher comes to life here, but Mr. O'Neal, looking hefty and unfunny, remains at sea. Mr. Palminteri's Tony tries to enliven the battle by frequently changing his mind about whom to kill. It hardly even matters. Thanks to occasionally workable wisecracks, like the thought that it's harder than ever for men to be faithful because they live longer and there are too many cocktail waitresses, Mr. Palminteri keeps the film from sinking completely. Cher also does her game best to find comic potential in a victim's role. Otherwise, ""Faithful"" is oddly bland, from its impersonal sets to the generic reasons Margaret and Jack have been so unhappy. The film makes fun of ""The Road Less Traveled"" for beginning with the pronouncement that life is difficult, but it itself isn't much wiser than that.""Faithful"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes frequent strong profanity and some sexual references.

DUDLEY MOORE may not want to play Hamlet but his ambition to play more or less straight roles has resulted in a series of unfortunate performances in even more unfortunate films - ''Six Weeks,'' ''Lovesick'' and ''Romantic Comedy.'' Actually, ''Lovesick'' wasn't all that bad but, let's face it, Mr. Moore is never going to be Cary Grant. However, when he's doing the supposedly low comedy of pratfall, disguise, drunkenness and fruitlessly manic endeavor, he's an incomparable performer. As he demonstrated in ''Arthur'' and ''10,'' he can be intelligent, sophisticated and brilliantly funny as an all-out clown.''Unfaithfully Yours,'' Howard Zieff's updated remake of Preston Sturges's 1948 comedy, which starred Rex Harrison and Linda Darnell, offers both Dudley Moores, the would- be romantic leading man and the obsessed troll, though the troll comes on too late to save the movie. ''Unfaithfully Yours'' opens today at the Sutton and other theaters. The original film was not one of Sturges's best, something to rank with ''The Lady Eve,'' ''The Palm Beach Story'' and ''Sullivan's Travels.'' However, the Sturges film, even before it reached its classically funny slapstick climax, did offer us Mr. Harrison in one of his most accomplished, urbane performances as a world-famous symphonic conductor who suddenly becomes obsessed by suspicions of the infidelities of his much younger wife, played by Miss Darnell. The Zieff film, based on an adaptation of the Sturges script by Valerie Curtin, Barry Levinson and Robert Klane, is played most of the time as a perfectly sincere romantic comedy interrupted by a slight misunderstanding. It's about Claude Eastman (Mr. Moore), an internationally acclaimed conductor who might be modeled on Leonard Bernstein; his much younger, very beautiful actress-wife, Daniella (Nastassja Kinski), and Max Stein (Armand Assante), the solo violinist who may or may not be Daniella's lover. The heart of the Sturges film are three fantasies in which the conductor imagines how he will deal with the illicit lovers, plus a final sequence in which he attempts to carry out one of his plans for revenge. The new film limits the conductor's fantasies to one and further dulls the satiric edges by making it plain that the wife is innocent. Mr. Moore is very funny as, during a concert featuring the possibly cuckolding violinist, he imagines how he will dispose of both his wife and the violinist in a private, postconcert celebration. Then his plans go wildly astray. Until then, though, the movie is an uphill slog. The movie does contain attractive supporting performances by Albert Brooks as Claude Eastman's personal manager; Richard Libertini as Claude's valet, and Richard B. Shull as a private eye whose report initiates the conductor's suspicions. Both Mr. Libertini and Mr. Shull would be completely at home in an authentic Sturges comedy. Miss Kinski is a major problem. She's a beauty, all right, but she appears to have no flair whatever for comedy of this sort, or maybe of any sort. I suspect that she's a far more intelligent actress than Miss Darnell, but this isn't an asset. What made Miss Darnell's performance so funny, and made the original film seem much sexier than this liberated one, was the apparent vacuity of the Darnell character. One never doubted the possibility that might she be carrying on with any number of men at the same time without giving any of them a moment's thought.''Unfaithfully Yours,'' which has been rated PG (''parental guidance suggested''), contains some partial nudity and some mildly vulgar language.

Screen: Unfaithful Wife - The New York Times,"and his commercial films look almost as personal as his art films. With ""Les Biches"" (1967), his reputation took a swing upward, at least in America, and ""La Femme Infidèle"" should establish him with audiences who may at last be open to what makes his vision strange and wonderful. Chabrol once filmed a modern version of the ""Hamlet"" story in which Claudius was innocent and the only person left both alive and sane at the end was Ophelia. He doesn't see things the way most people do. He sees the same things, and he often sees them better (the handsome suburban house and the Paris apartment in ""La Femme Infidèle"" offer fine lessons in traditional interior decorating—with deep browns and blues and muted yellow greens), but he sees them as odd. In the film, just before Charles (Michel Bouquet bops Victor (Maurice Ronet), his wife's lover, over the head with a weighty little portrait bust, he discovers a keepsake on Victor's night table. It is a giant Zippo pocket lighter that he had given his wife on a wedding anniversary (although he is the one who smokes — to incredible excess), and the sight of this huge grotesquerie actually brings tears to his eyes and impels him to fight for his marriage by eliminating Victor. For the most part, the world of ""La Femme Infidèle"" is resolutely good-looking. Chabrol fills his rooms with fresh flowers and with a sense of orderly livability. But the most subtle dislocations catch you up. The camera tracks with lyrical gravity—but with a little too much lyrical gravity, like a gesture so little in excess of the occasion that it would seem nearly perfect if you hadn't sensed that it was also slightly mad. Michel Bouquet, for example, plays Charles with great suavity and grace—except that he stares intently, and I do believe he is a trifle cross-eyed. And though he is the image of a man born to be cuckolded (like a French Herbert Marshall), he happens to have a pretty good time with his wife. So the plot of ""La Femme Infidèle"" makes even less sense than many Chabrol plots—which doesn't matter, because the meaning has less to do with sense than with sensibility. However, even in this context Charles's adventures in disposing of Victor's body (a long, entertaining sequence — and a tribute to Hitchcock's ""Psycho"") move have no little to do with the case as to mislead the moviegoer temporarily as to the kind of film he is watching. But the moviegoer will be reassured when he returns his attention to the unfaithful wife herself. The actress is Stephane Audran, Chabrol's own wife, and she is beautiful, though a little ironic. She controls a sense of social parody so sustained that her simple ""Bonjour"" becomes a major critique of French language and civilizaton. Near the very end of the film, when she accidentally discovers that her husband has killed her lover, she destroys the evidence (no use; the police will come for him shortly) and then walks out to where he is working in his garden. As the camera travels with her, it watches in medium close-up while she composes the beginnings of a smile. The making of that smile, enigmatic and discreet, must count as one of the finest small passages in the history of cinema—and in the lovely, disquieting art of Claude Chabrol.

The Screen: 'Devotion'; Russian Import Has Debut at Stanley - The New York Times,"all of them—set forth in simple terms, there is real pathos and persuasiveness, as long as the picture sticks to the immediate business at hand. However the emotional continuity in persistently broken by the graceless direction of K. Pyryev, who wrote the scenario with the Tur Brothers. At times, the action stops for a stream of reminiscences about the citizen's duty to the state. At others, the principals even toss off a song, apparently just for the fun of it. And the entire picture, which unfolds against a May Day celebration background, is riddled with attractive but meaningless scenes, as happy throngs spill over what looks to be the entire city. The couple, incidentally, is reunited in a melodramatic climax. That it matters at all must be attributed to sheer dint of acting. As the tormented pair, L. Gallis and N.

K. O. is releasing at the Park Avenue, traces the rehabilitation of a group of Jewish war orphans against the hectic background of the newborn state. Joseph Leytes, who wrote, directed and produced this picturesque and frequently compelling drama, using a small cast of non-professionals, with a few exceptions, deserves full credit on several counts. Excellently photographed and performed with restraint, here is a simple story of psychological readjustment, confined, for the most part, to a children's settlement in suburban Jerusalem and managing, nevertheless, to convey almost exactly the confused political turbulence of the entire area. Mr. Leytes is examining two methods of reconditioning war-hardened youngsters to paradoxically unsettled reality, as practiced by a kindly Viennese settlement worker, finely played by John Slater, and a brash young American, enacted by an amiable actor named Jamie Smith. Mr. Leytes has allowed the pace to lag occasionally, but his dialogue is imaginative. Two of the scenes are superb, one when the camera scours the numbed faces of the moppets after their bus has been stoned by Arabs. And there is a chilling midnight talkfest in the barracks as the little ones, cigarettes burning, discuss their own backgrounds and the altruistic elders. Dina Peskin, Israel Hanin, Juda Levi and Amnon Lifshitz, as the ringleaders of the gradually softened rebels, are painfully convincing troupers. Mr. Leytes' film stands out in part rather than on the whole, however, after thoroughly conveying the off-screen strife by suggestion, and a few good-and-bad encounters with the British, he has concocted a melodramatic climax that packs Mr. Smith, the children's idol by now, off to a trench skirmish against the Arabs and a last-minute rescue of a water supply truck. Having done such a good job on the fringe of the conflict, Mr. Leytes owes his own explanation to the spectator, as well as to the questioning children, about the real meaning of the shooting.

"THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Preston Sturges' First Release in 4 Years, 'Unfaithfully Yours,' Bows at Roxy - The New York Times","maybe two—a year. For nobody makes films as he does, even when he makes them less well, which means that his public grows impatient and resentful when he tarries too long. A little trace of this resentment may be churlishly displayed by Mr. Sturges' public toward his new film, ""Unfaithfully Yours."" Four years have been permitted to go gurgling down the drain since the last release of a Sturges picture (""Hail the Conquering Hero"")—and that's too long. Also, a shade of something fatal to a champion may be perceived in his new picture at the Roxy. That's a slip in his timing and his speed. Like a boxer who takes too long a lay-off, Mr. Sturges has slowed up a bit. And this is something which his public will be the first to note and deplore. But, for all its occasional slow stretches and its fleeting delays on the punch, ""Unfaithfully Yours"" is a dilly of a sardonic slapstick comedy. It has the old Sturges contrivance of fantastic complexities and his open impiety toward persons and legends which we solemnly revere. It has wit in its charming off-hand touches. It has ""boff"" in its three big slapstick scenes. And although it doesn't shatter any idols, it makes a nice satiric point. That point is that a top orchestra leader, the lion of all the long-hairs, can be as lurid and banal in his thinking as any reader of the daily tabloids. Or rather, to put it more precisely, he is not above letting his mind, supposedly as clear and pure as crystal, think in movie cliches. The hero is this great symphonic maestro who suddenly and darkly suspects that his beautiful wife, for whom he is passionate, has been unfaithful to him. And so one night, while conducting a concert before a mob of ermined swells, his thoughts turn to various revenges which he will take when he goes home that night. While conducting Rossini's ""Semiramide,"" he visions a beautifully suave way to murder his wife and then plant it upon the man he suspects. In the midst of Wagner's Venusberg music, he sees himself being magnanimous and calm, surrendering his wife to her lover with brave words and a check for a huge sum. And finally, while tearing out the overture of Tchaikovsky's ""Francesca da Rimini,"" he has the romantic notion of a suicide gamble with his rival for his wife. At the end of the film (it might be mentioned), he attempts to carry out the first idea, with results that are far from successful, homicidally speaking, but great for fun. Of course, it must be conceded that Mr. Sturges' symphonic gent is not the conventional maestro. He is a charmingly wry and fluid chap, with a great many obvious human failings, which Rex Harrison deliciously displays. So maybe he doesn't serve exactly as a prototype for satire. But he makes a most pleasantly diverting personality in a Sturges farce. So, too, does Linda Darnell as the orchestra leader's lovely wife. She isn't what you'd call an inspiration for his music—but she is for this film! And Barbara Lawrence, Rudy Vallee, Lionel Stander and Edgar Kennedy fill in other roles, those outlines of comic personalities which are famous in Mr. Sturges' works. A word should be said for the music, which some may overlook in paying too rapt attention to the developments of the farce. It is fully and richly presented in fine symphonic style. The idea of using it to background movie cut-ups is a true Sturges conceit. Indeed, every bit of this picture is Sturges down to the ground—the notion, the writing, the direction—and could likely come only from him. Maybe it isn't top Sturges. Maybe he spent too many years at nothing—or shadow-boxing with that unreleased Harold Lloyd film he made. It still is a cheerful entertainment, the work of an agile, adult mind. If its humor escapes some people, that is too bad for them. On the stage at the Roxy are Peter Lind Hayes, Mary Healy, the Gaudsmith Brothers, Jack Cole and his dancers and an ice ballet featuring Arnold Shoda and Joan Hyldoft.

"' The Unfaithful,' Post-War Study Starring Ann Sheridan, Lew Ayres and Zachary Scott, Has Its Premiere at the Strand - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from June 28, 1947, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The Warner Brothers have turned out a better than average murder mystery in ""The Unfaithful,"" but they have badly over-weighted with melodramatics the things they obviously wanted to say about a pressing social problem. The new picture at the Strand stabs and jabs like a hit-and-run prizefighter at the subject of hasty divorces and the dangerous consequences to society of this ill conceived cure all for marital difficulties, but it never gets across a telling dramatic punch. However, through some uncommonly persuasive acting and skillful direction the patently artificial plot stands up surprisingly well. Being the story of a wife who committed an indiscretion while her husband was overseas and sincerely regrets the transgression, the opportunities when the film easily could have slithered into slobbering sentimentality are many. But sure hands save the day. Chris Hunter's desire to keep her husband in blissful ignorance, even when she becomes dangerously implicated in a killing, is quite understandable. But the authors stretch coincidence to a thin point when they have it turn out that the intruder she kills is the very fellow who took advantage of her wartime loneliness. What seems at first like a clear cut case of justifiable homicide, slowly turns to suspicion of murder as the probing police pick apart the pack of lies she tells in a vain attempt to hold her husband's love. Ann Sheridan deserves great credit for making Chris Hunter a credible character, even though hers is not a penetrating study of a shamed women. Lew Ayres as a lawyer friend, who is prone to advise his clients against thoughtlessly rushing from marriage to marriage, gives a splendid performance. He moves about the screen with an authority that commands attention. Zachary Scott brings strong conviction to the role of the husband, and John Hoyt is equally successful as the police lieutenant. While the film keeps alluding to the swelling divorce problem, it doesn't really tackle it until the principals decide to thus terminate their marriage after Mrs. Hunter's innocence is established by the jury. Then it unfortunately starts moralizing in a preachy fashion. But, at least, ""The Unfaithful"" attempts to accomplish something worthwhile.

Edna Best and Herbert Marshall in a Pictorial Translation of a Monckton Hoffe Play. - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from August 15, 1933, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Even with the presence of those efficient British players, Edna Best and her husband, Herbert Marshall, the pictorial version of Monckton Hoffe's play, ""The Faithful Heart,"" which is now at the Mayfair, is more than slightly disappointing. It lacks sincerity and the realistic and convincing notes of the original. Victor Saville's direction is frequently staccato, and here and there one finds an awkward sparring for time between lines. So far as the story is concerned, it adheres fairly closely to the author's work, but it is skeletonized, and there is an unfortunate abruptness in many of the scenes. Actually, it is a feature which reveals the importance of the director, for Miss Best has done well before the camera and Mr. Marshall was always in great demand in Hollywood. Yet they cannot be said to distinguish themselves in this offering, or do nearly as well as they did in the screen translation of ""Michael and Mary,"" which was adequately directed by the same Mr. Saville. In the course of the narrative there is a lapse of more than twenty years, and Miss Best assumes the rôles of both a mother and her daughter. The initial episodes are set forth in a ""pub"" in Southampton, England, into which Waverley Ango (Mr. Marshall), a steamship officer, wanders while cheerful and somewhat daring through alcoholic drinks. Because Gracie (Miss Best), the barmaid, is fair he decides to call her Blackie, and with little ado they soon become infatuated with each other. Eventually Ango receives a sudden order to return to his ship for another voyage. Subsequently, Ango appears as a Brigadier in the British Army. It is 1919, and Ango is engaged to marry Diana, the daughter of Sir Gilbert Oughterson. Ango is another of those screen characters with whom time has dealt most kindly, for his appearance is not greatly changed from when he was a man of the seas two decades before. Just when Diana and Ango are looking for an apartment, which, he insists, must be within his own means, Blackie, a daughter of Gracie, now dead, appears on the scene, with a letter written by her mother many years ago. Hence Ango is placed in the position of looking after the girl and, while Diana behaves in a sympathetic and exemplary fashion, Blackie is unhappy. She is, of course, Ango's daughter, and it is a question whether he should stand by his daughter or his fiancée, and this is solved by Ango. Lawrence Hanray, who acts the rôle of ""The Major,"" a bibulous person who looks like a bookmaker, is quite good, his make-up being excellent. Anne Grey is understanding as Diana and Athole Stewart is acceptable as Sir Gilbert. As for Miss Best and Mr. Marshall, they succeed in offering some appealing acting, but often they are victims of the direction.

‘6 Underground’ Review: Action by the Numbers - The New York Times,"If the B-movie director Andy Sidaris were alive today, he’d be pretty ticked off about “6 Underground,” now streaming on Netflix. In 1979, Sidaris, whose low-budget actioners were generously cast with Playboy Playmates who shot guns and shed their tops with diligent reliability, made “Seven,” in which a master assassin deployed a team of seven specialized killers to take out drug traffickers in Hawaii. “6 Underground,” the budget of which could probably have funded at least 500 Sidarises, stars Ryan Reynolds as a self-ghosted billionaire in charge of a team of five other espionage specialists out to “do something” about “the evil in this world.” Directed by Michael Bay with his customary fast-cutting, low-angle-semi-circling-camera, huge-destruction-of-real-and-simulated-property style, “6 Underground” isn’t a wholly blatant Sidaris rip. For instance, Bay flirts with female nudity, as usual, but never crosses the line. The R rating here is earned with blood and gouged eyeballs. Reynold’s character is like Deadpool filtered through Elon Musk, if Elon Musk were cool, or “cool.” But his performance feels a little disinterested. Hardly matters. The movie opens with a high-speed car chase during which one of the team has bullet-extraction surgery in the back seat. And that’s almost 20 minutes right there. Engineering a coup in a geopolitical hot spot so vaguely rendered it could be Middle Eastern or South Asian, the gang performs a “Penthouse Extraction” (sounds like what 1970s teen boys did with the magazines their dads hid in the garage). This involves compromising the integrity of an infinity pool with extreme prejudice and then, parkour, parkour, parkour. When it comes to turning up action to 11, Bay is incorrigible. Not just with sound and fury; there are genuinely eccentric innovations here. There’s certainly not a whole lot of recognizable humanity, but hey, that’s why there’s “It’s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.”6 UndergroundRated R for blood, gouged eyeballs, and much more gore.

‘Barbara Rubin’ Review: An Overlooked Filmmaker Gets Her Due - The New York Times,"and the actual trajectory of her life — can’t help but evoke the 19th-century poet. The comparison is made several times in “Barbara Rubin & the Exploding NY Underground,” an informative and overdue documentary directed by Chuck Smith. The movie begins with the stark declaration that the most daring and uncompromising figure in the early ‘60s New York experimental film scene was “an 18-year-old-girl.” Rubin, whose family hailed from Cambria Heights in Queens, spent a portion of her teens in a psychiatric hospital. Her release entailed her getting a job; a relative arranged for her to intern with Jonas Mekas, the filmmaker, film archivist and writer who was the most significant instigator of underground film at the time. Featuring reminiscences and observations from a wide range of friends and critics (one of these interviewees, Amy Taubin, is both), the documentary sketches Rubin’s alliances with the likes of Bob Dylan, Andy Warhol, the Velvet Underground and Allen Ginsberg. Because, frustratingly, there appears to be no extant footage of Rubin being interviewed, the talking heads serve as docents through a life that has many corners of obscurity. There are also reproduced portions of “Christmas on Earth,” the work for which she is best known. It was made in two reels, one of which was to be projected full screen, the other to be projected as an inset of the larger frame. In the large frame are gigantic, probing close-ups of female genitalia; the action in the smaller frame depicts nude performers in stark body paint engaged in exploratory sexual activity. The movie’s provocation has nothing to do with titillation. It is something more simple: a demand to look, to see. That the demand, as blunt as it was, came from a young female artist in a milieu in which women were so frequently subjugated and discouraged is still startling; there’s a sense in which “Christmas on Earth” can be seen as not having had enough influence. While the viewer never hears Rubin’s speaking voice in the film, excerpts from her letters, read by friends, put across her frustrations as her larger-scale ambitions fail to come to fruition. Like Rimbaud, she abdicated art at a young age, having five children before her death in 1980, at 35. Her children did not participate in the film, only adding to Rubin’s enigma. Nevertheless, in part because of the mysteries it encompasses, this story feels complete.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/movies/barbara-rubin-and-the-exploding-ny-underground-review.html
"Review: In ‘Level Up,’ Yanked From a Video Game Stupor to a Real Mission - The New York Times","man seeking woman endures a surreal urban odyssey — into a familiar vision of technology-fostered callousness. Guided by texts from Anna’s kidnappers, Matt barges across London and through situations of varying seediness and peril. Along the way, he encounters strangers who want to harm him, hinder him or have sex with him. All are weird, and none are memorable. Unlovely and uninvolving, “Level Up” is a running-man cocktail of brutality spiked with low-level humor. Directing his first feature, Adam Randall (who wrote the screenplay with Gary Young) shows some aptitude for the tease and for maintaining a stranglehold on the movie’s sourly cynical tone. As does his cinematographer, Eben Bolter, who gives key indoor scenes a bilious menace. Yet a story this reliant on a deeply dyspeptic view of today’s young men requires a lead with considerably more charisma and skills than Mr. Bowman. More bland cipher than resourceful rescuer, his Matt is merely the maypole around which other characters dance and ribbons of plot wind and release.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/movies/level-up-review.html
FILM REVIEW; A Trip Back to the Contradictions of the Stormy 60's - The New York Times,"''When you feel you have right on your side, you can do some pretty horrific things.''So says Brian Flanagan in ''The Weather Underground,'' an intelligently assembled documentary that opens today at Film Forum in Manhattan. Mr. Flanagan is a former member of the Weathermen, the revolutionary antiwar group that began in 1969, and his remark suggests both the motivation and the modus operandi of the organization.''Underground'' tells the story of a splinter group of young people from the Students for a Democratic Society, or S. D. S. And here the directors Sam Green and Bill Siegel have unearthed a great story that had fallen into oblivion: the young, violent and glamorous antiestablishment militants of the 1960's. The film notes that the group took its name from a Bob Dylan song with the lyric ''You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.'' The song, by the way, is ''Subterranean Homesick Blues''; its title describes the feelings of some of the Weathermen, who were forced to live underground for much longer than they had expected. This terrifically smart and solid piece of filmmaking lets the former Weathermen, now in their 50's and older, speak into the camera and reveal a bit of their personal histories as well as what the peace movement meant to them. The narration is introduced about 10 minutes into the film. At first we're introduced to former activists as they looked when ''Underground'' was filmed; then we're shown more youthful images. The stars of ''Underground'' were, as Weathermen, determined to overthrow the United States government, believing it had criminally waged war in Vietnam and persecuted groups like the Black Panthers. Voluble and charismatic, young, white and articulate, they spent a lot of time in the news media spotlight; figures like Bernadette Dohrn, Bill Ayers, Mark Rudd, Naomi Jaffe and Mr. Flanagan were clearly sexy criminals. Todd Gitlin, who was an S. D. S. president and is now an author and a professor of journalism at Columbia, summarizes their appeal: ''Like Bonnie and Clyde, many of them were attractive personally. They were into youth, exuberance, sex, drugs. They wanted action.''That exuberance has been captured by the filmmakers. Mr. Green and Mr. Siegel have made ''Underground'' a film of passions, showing what a turbulent period the late 1960's were and slyly contrasting the peace-and-love vibe with events of the time. The S. D. S. began as a nonviolent movement that adopted armed struggle only to make a statement, the movie explains. But the Weathermen felt that S. D. S. wasn't going far enough. As a former Weatherman, Ms. Jaffe, puts it, her voice still girlishly soft: ''We felt that doing nothing in a period of repressive violence was itself a form of violence. That's really the part I think is hardest for people to understand.''Mr. Green and Mr. Siegel convey the volatility of the time through news film. The documentary is packed with some of the most powerful images of violence of the period: a bound Vietnamese man being shot in the head at point-blank range, the bloody bed of the Black Panther Fred Hampton after he was shot to death by the authorities. The movie captures a movement in motion, with its contradictions of good intentions and narcissism -- a revolt so accelerated and noisy, there was no time for reflection during its heyday. But ''Underground'' doesn't let its subjects off the hook, despite an apparent sympathy for their politics. Reflecting on the impact of their behavior -- the group took responsibility for bombing two dozen public buildings, including the Pentagon -- these former radicals now reconsider their approach. Mr. Rudd, who now teaches math at a community college, smiles painfully when he talks about telling his students what he did in the 60's. ''My students look at me as if I were from another planet,'' he says. Mr. Flanagan draws a connection between the Weathermen's actions and the Oklahoma City bombing. The men now see as much wrong as right in their previous lives. The women are still full of hope. By the end Ms. Jaffe admits that she'd do it again if she could be smarter about it. That mixture of optimism and toughness was what started the Weathermen, and it still has a place in Ms. Jaffe's heart. It's also the spirit of ''The Weather Underground.''THE WEATHER UNDERGROUNDDirected by Sam Green and Bill Siegel; directors of photography, Andrew Black and Federico Salsano; edited by Mr. Green and Dawn Logsdon; music by Dave Cerf and Amy Domingues; produced by Mr. Green, Mr. Siegel, Carrie Lozano and Marc Smolowitz.

FILM REVIEW; Homeless and Helpless in Romania - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from September 19, 2001, Section E, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. One of the most dismaying images in ''Children Underground,'' Edet Belzberg's raw, cinéma vérité portrait of homeless Romanian children scrounging on the streets of Bucharest, is the silver-smeared face of a 14-year-old girl addicted to inhaling Aurolac, a toxic metallic paint. Macarena, as she is nicknamed, is the most disoriented of the five orphaned and runaway children whom the film follows over the course of a year. As Macarena, who was brought up in an orphanage, fantasizes dazedly about having a family waiting for her in another country and a twin sister with the same name, she seems lost beyond repair. When ''Children Underground'' was filmed three years ago, Aurolac, which is ruinous to the lungs and produces a chronic, hacking cough, was the drug of choice among the city's homeless youth. Since then, the movie's epilogue says, heroin has taken over. The members of this loosely knit pack eke out an existence by begging and doing occasional odd jobs for storekeepers. They sleep in a subway station on slabs of cardboard and bathe by pouring water from plastic soda bottles over their hands and faces. Most are lice-infested. In the hardheaded view of the few agencies devoted to helping the city's 30,000 homeless children, reclaiming a child who has lived on the streets for very long is all but impossible, especially when drugs are involved. The misery ''Children Underground'' records is a bitter legacy of the despotic Ceausescu regime, which outlawed contraception and abortion as part of a program to increase the country's work force. As a result, thousands of unwanted children were born to parents living in such poverty that they were unable to care for their offspring. Many were deposited in state-run orphanages. Since 1989, Romania's failure to adjust to a free-market economy has left the country one of the poorest in Eastern Europe.''Children Underground'' goes out of its way not to sentimentalize its subjects. Its visual rhythms are harsh and jagged. It doesn't try to impose a tight narrative structure and has no music. There are no caring mommies and daddies waiting in the wings to make things better. All five of the children under examination appear seriously damaged. The most colorful is the group's swaggering self-appointed leader and stern den mother, Cristina, who was raised in an orphanage and has been living on the street since she was 11. To protect herself from sexual assault, Cristina, who is 16, has shorn her hair and tries to pass as a boy. The child who seems most salvageable is 12-year-old Mihai, a smart, spunky runaway who doesn't sniff paint and who dreams of going to school and having a job. But when Mihai, who left home at 8 or 9 to escape his father's beatings, is offered the chance to reunite with his family, he balks in terror. The film visits his glum, impoverished family (the father is away), and you sense deep trouble. The youngest members of the pack, also runaways, are a sister and brother, 10-year-old Ana and her younger brother, Marian, who is 8. The pair are pathetic, frightened creatures who alternately cling to each other and fight. When the film visits their family, the gaunt, hard-boiled stepfather claims to care about them but describes Ana as psychopathic.''Children Underground,'' which opens today at Film Forum, is more uncomfortable to watch than many documentaries because the filmmakers, who were obviously in a position to change the lives of their subjects, stand back and do nothing beyond aiming their cameras. That passivity in the face of such misery inevitably becomes a theme of the movie. It's one thing for a news crew to pay a detached visit to a scene of social devastation, then depart, and another for a film crew to spend a year observing a group of lost children without trying to save them. Ms. Belzberg, to her credit, directly addresses that question in the movie's production notes. ''The decision not to intervene was one of the biggest personal challenges I faced in making this film,'' she writes. ''I realized early on that if we were to intervene, it would make a difference for the children only in the very short term, and meanwhile, because the crises were so relentless, the film would not get made.''This sad declaration of ultimate impotence is supported by everything seen on the screen, and it makes ''Children Underground'' a singularly depressing film. In the face of such unrelieved, grinding poverty, hope fades.

The abysmal state of comedy glares with all the subtlety of a mandrill's rump off any screen unfortunate enough to display ''The Underground Comedy Movie.''A series of sketches built around subjects like masturbation, defecation, alienation, urination, necrophilia, voyeurism, casual brutality and mockery of the unfortunate, this exercise in arrested adolescence comes with the subtitle ''guaranteed to offend.''It does, but not because of its utter tastelessness. Tastelessness and funniness need not be incompatible. But Vince Offer, who accepts responsibility for this wretched film by arrogating the writer's and director's credits, makes the common mistake of equating the recognition of comic potential for comedy itself. For the successful, talent bridges the gap, but here it is absent. As a typical result, ''The Godmother,'' a dismal attempt at parody of ''The Godfather,'' goes nowhere, especially in the moments when Joey Buttafuoco, better known for his off-screen sexual exploits, tries to make something of an endless exchange involving milk and cookies for a guest of the don. Mr. Buttafuoco's presence in ''The Underground Comedy Movie'' gives some indication of the heights of stardom and thespian prowess to which the film aspires, although Karen Black, who has known far better times, also lends herself to this sorry enterprise.''The Underground Comedy Movie'' stands as a monument to ineptitude and self-delusion.

FILM REVIEW; (Musical) Notes From the (Paris) Underground - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from March 31, 1999, Section E, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Near the end of ''The Underground Orchestra,'' Heddy Honigmann's moving documentary about exiled musicians living in Paris, an Argentine classical pianist, Miguel Angel Estrella, remembers the shattering events that drove him to leave his country when it was governed by a repressive military regime. Arrested and tortured, Mr. Estrella was accused of giving aid and comfort to anti-Government forces (the lower class, which his captors dismissed as ''scum'') simply because he played for the poor. The fact of his being a musician was deemed sufficient to stimulate a dangerous class consciousness. While Mr. Estrella was blindfolded and shackled, his hands were severely injured, and he was told they would be severed. But just before an execution that he believed was imminent, the torture stopped. Years of medical treatment in France eventually enabled him to regain the use of his hands and to play the piano again. This pianist's story, related in a tone more sad than embittered, is one of many loosely woven tales in a documentary that begins as a study of Parisian subway musicians, then broadens into a poignant meditation on social and political exile. Like this Dutch filmmaker's earlier documentaries, ''Metal and Melancholy'' and ''O Amor Natural,'' explorations of South American attitudes toward cars and sex that carry a much broader resonance than these subjects might suggest, ''The Underground Orchestra'' is an open-ended celebration of human tenacity and life force that builds up a compelling personal vision in a offhanded, roundabout way. One reason it's so inspiring is that you never sense a mawkish triumph-of-the-human-spirit agenda being pushed. That spirit reveals itself bit by bit.''The Underground Orchestra,'' which opens today at Film Forum, begins with a descent into the Paris Metro, where musicians from countries all over the world jubilantly perform for handouts. Those who don't have work passports are constantly on guard against being arrested by the police, who seem to have a fairly laissez-faire attitude. Among the musicians we meet are a Venezuelan harpist whose ethereally gorgeous strumming transforms a subway tunnel into a Orphean cave, a father-and-son violin duo from Romania and a classical violinist from Yugoslavia. The Romanians tell of how their initial euphoria after the fall of Communism quickly evaporated as a political and economic climate coalesced that was almost as bad as the previous one. Because the Yugoslavian violinist who had played for the National Opera was granted political asylum in France, he says, he can't go back to his homeland even though the political situation there has changed enough to make his return possible. Before long, the filmmakers are chased out of the Metro by the police, who tell them it's illegal to film there. Above ground, they continue meeting musicians from places as diverse as Central Africa and Vietnam. A Vietnamese woman playing a kotolike instrument gives a vividly poetic description of what various passages and sounds are intended to evoke. One of the most charismatic musicians interviewed is a disk jockey and singer from Zaire who tells of being enslaved by the Mobutu regime and sent to a forced labor camp from which few prisoners have ever returned. He escaped, he says, on a six-week barefoot trek through the jungle. The movie ends with an extraordinarily beautiful song about exile and longing for the fatherland performed by an exiled Algerian singer, Fateh Benlala. Among other things, ''The Underground Orchestra'' is an informal world-music primer featuring some astonishingly beautiful sounds. We feel the paradoxical power of music to transcend national boundaries while serving as a profound spiritual connection to the homeland left behind but never forgotten.

He has a terminally boring job as a government clerk. He sleeps on a daybed in his hovel of a one-room basement apartment, decorated with art-museum postcards taped on the wall. He knows he's pathetic (''I'm a sick man,'' he says in the opening scene, staring into the camera), but that doesn't improve his bad attitude. He has no friends, no dates, no money. He also has no name. Who better than the remarkable and underused Henry Czerny to bring him to complicated, warped life in ''Notes From Underground,'' a modern-day film version of Dostoyevsky's 1864 novella? Mr. Czerny hasn't had a role this fascinating since his monstrous but sympathetic pedophile priest in ''The Boys of St. Vincent.''''I have so many unpleasant memories,'' the man announces. The one he chooses to share begins when he invites himself to a dinner party with four old college acquaintances. They don't like him, and he knows it. But he believes that he can change that, so he presses his tie, puts on his best suit, practices handing out one-dollar tips gracefully and takes the bus to a restaurant called Cafe de Paris. Of course he's an hour early, and his pen has leaked ink onto his shirt.''I dreamed of dominating them, of seducing them with my wit,'' the man reveals in voice-over, referring to his old acquaintances. Instead, he drinks too much and insults them. By the end of the evening, the others are talking about Descartes, ski trips and 401-K's over cigars and brandy. He's sitting at the table, sullen and alone. He borrows money from one of them, spends it on a taxi and follows them to a brothel, which fortunately for him takes credit cards. ''At last, real life, conflict, emotion!'' he thinks, en route. After sex, he exudes his usual charm by telling his chosen prostitute, Liza (Sheryl Lee, playing the role with a convincing combination of numbness and vulnerability), that she is ''working in a death house'' and ''swimming in a lake of rancid semen,'' and that he feels sick being there with her. Uncharacteristically, he gives her his address and suggests she abandon her career for him. When she does, there is some chance of his making meaningful human contact, but the odds are against it. Especially when he whispers sweet nothings like, ''I was laughing at you then; I'm laughing at you now.''''Notes From Underground,'' which opens today at the Anthology Film Archives (Second Avenue at Second Street, East Village), is a small, impressive and disturbing movie, the portrait of a tortured, completely unaware human being who believes he is brutally honest with himself (''Maybe I enjoy being unhappy if it means being honest''). In one of the film's most memorable images, the man stands in his apartment, soaking wet from rain, between an ironing board and what can only be called a dinette set. As if in a Diane Arbus photograph, he looks simultaneously too large for his surroundings and inarguably at home. Even here, he doesn't fit in.

Well, there's Microsoft, the corporate giant that lures smart young people into forsaking their bohemian ways to become well-salaried drones on its sprawling campus. There's also right-wing talk radio and soft-core pornography that demeans and objectifies women. Those are about the only things that the characters in ''Slaves to the Underground,'' a sympathetic, documentary-style portrait of youthful discontent in America's dreamiest big city can find to get exercised about. But when the members of No Exit, an all-female punk band storm into a radio station, bind and gag the bullying host of a talk show and pirate his air time, you feel a surge of adrenaline. And when Shelly (Molly Gross), the band's sexually ambivalent guitarist, delivers a scathing analysis of her parents' favorite movie, ''The Graduate,'' dismissing its hero as a creepy, unlovable stalker, you see her point.''Slaves to the Underground,'' directed by Kristine Peterson from a screenplay by Bill Cody, is a brave and refreshing little movie in a number of ways. Its youthful characters are genuinely confused people flailing about in relationships whose turbulence feels uncomfortably real. For all their vaunted sophistication, they seem terribly young, vulnerable, and not fully formed: in other words, true-to-life. Although Shelly is having a passionate lesbian affair with No Exit's lead singer Suzy (Marisa Ryan), a scarily angry feminist who looks for excuses to beat men up, Shelly leaves her lover to return to her gentle ex-boyfriend Jimmy (Jason Bortz), who publishes his own little magazine. The breakup, which comes just as No Exit is about to be given a recording contract, threatens the future of the band. If the movie, which opens today at the Quad Cinema, suffers from some awkward plotting, its band of self-styled outsiders, most of whom deliver at least one impromptu soul-searching soliloquy to the camera, are alive in all their gawky floundering sincerity. And the performances, especially Ms. Ryan's ominous Suzy, have a wonderfully lived-in spontaneity.''Slaves to the Underground'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and several scenes of nudity. STEPHEN HOLDEN",http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/14/movies/film-in-review-130184.html

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Emir Kusturica's wild, sprawling ''Underground'' begins with drunken revelry, the kind that erupts frequently throughout the course of the film and accounts for a good deal of its three-hour running time. If Mr. Kusturica, who won the Palme d'Or at the 1995 Cannes International Film Festival for this feverish, whimsical allegory elevated by moments of brilliant clarity, appears to be overindulging a taste for celebration, he has good reason. The film's real heart is its devastating idea of a morning after: the moment when, after being in the grip of a political delusion lasting several decades, a man can emerge from a subterranean hiding place in his native Yugoslavia and be told that there is no Yugoslavia any more. Mr. Kusturica's impassioned metaphorical fable about the tragic fate of his homeland also reaches this terrible insight: ''There is no war until a brother kills his brother.''Though the politics of ''Underground'' have been assailed and dissected by international audiences (the film still has no American distributor, despite obvious merits that outweigh its carousing excesses), the debate is largely specious. There's no hidden agenda to this robust and not terribly subtle tale of duplicity. Mr. Kusturica's central idea becomes a daringly blunt representation of political chicanery that fools an entire society, and of the corruption that lets one man thrive at the expense of his dearest friend. The film maker keeps that premise hearty by filming ''Underground'' as if the circus had come to town. Beginning in 1941, ''Underground'' presents the friendship of Blacky (Lazar Ristovski) and Marko (nimbly played by Miki Manojlovic), both enthusiastic members of the Communist Party. Their nightlong celebration at the beginning of the film is spoiled by bombing that kills animals in the local zoo, intimating what all the film's innocents have in store. The sight of these helpless animals is the sort of image that abruptly anchors ''Underground'' just as its recklessness threatens to spin out of control. Marko and Blacky join forces for a while to thwart occupying Nazi forces in ways that border on slapstick. Mr. Kusturica does not cast introverts. And he directs some of the film so broadly that it resembles silent comedy. In this rip-roaring spirit, both men court Vera (Mirjana Karanovic), the beautiful actress who becomes the wedge between them. An eagerness to steal Vera helps induce Marko to lure his friend underground. The film's central plot device finds Blacky and friends, not to mention a pet chimpanzee, tricked into living in a cellar below Marko's home. Years go by. Marko hangs onto Vera and becomes a prominent party official, while his friends underground sing a song that goes, ''Is it moonlight at noon? Is it sunlight at midnight?'' They manufacture munitions, convinced by Marko's tricks and by his recording of air raid sirens that the war is not over.''Underground'' has the bravado to string out this deception and its consequences over 50 years, so that it ultimately encompasses the fall of Communism and the war in Bosnia. Playing out the game between Blacky and Marko in toweringly dramatic terms and in a vast political arena, the film also finds time for curious and welcome bursts of humor. Blacky's return to the real world coincides with the filming of a heroic account of Marko's wartime experiences, so that Blacky cannot distinguish between reality and deception. The film's anger is communicated most powerfully at such nominally playful moments.''Underground'' ends magnificently, with a vision that melds tragedy with optimism and that has been realized by Mr. Kusturica with the fanciful magicianship that is very much his own. It's a virtue that would have been more apparent in a more concise ''Underground.'' The film is nominally shorter than it was at Cannes, but its party scenes still unfold with an endless and exhausting frenzy until every last tuba has been heard.''Underground'' will be shown tonight at 8 at Alice Tully Hall as part of the New York Film Festival.

"For Warhol, to Be Was to Be on Screen - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from January 27, 1995, Section C, Page 28Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Andy Warhol's statement that in the future everyone would be famous for 15 minutes was not just an idle remark. The pop artist and film maker worked diligently to make that prediction come true in the movies he made during the 1960's. In the early days of hisfilm-making career, just about anyone who wanted to be in a movie was encouraged to have a screen test at the artist's West 47th Street Factory in Manhattan. According to Hollywood myth, Lana Turner was discovered sipping a soda at Schwab's Drug Store in downtown Los Angeles. Many of those who flocked to be in Warhol's early films were Lana Turners in their own minds. By the mid-1960's, the members of Warhol's constantly changing repertory company of bohemians, exhibitionists, narcissists and self-promoters were facetitously known as ""superstars.""Beginning today and running through Feb. 9, Film Forum in the South Village is presenting a retrospective of 23 Warhol movies, divided into 13 programs. The series begins with Warhol's 1966 breakthrough film, ""The Chelsea Girls,"" a nearly three-and-a-half-hour split-screen talk fest filmed at the Chelsea Hotel and featuring Mario Montez, Ondine and Brigid Polk. Also of special interest is ""The Velvet Underground and Nico"" (1966), which chronicles a rehearsal of the legendary New York rock band starring Lou Reed, John Cale and Nico. ""Lonesome Cowboys"" (1968), a mock western filmed in Arizona, is one of the first Warhol films to feature his company's resident hunk, Joe Dallesandro. In the leering, gabby ""My Hustler"" (1965), a bunch of Fire Island sybarites compete for the favors of a dumb male prostitute. Edie Sedgwick, the most famous of Warhol's superstars, is featured in ""Vinyl,"" ""Lupe"" and ""Poor Little Rich Girl,"" all from 1965. The retropective will also feature a selection of Warhol's silent movies in which an unmoving camera remained fixed on a subject, sometimes for hours on end. Perhaps the most famous is ""Empire,"" an extended static shot of the Empire State Building, an excerpt of which will be shown in the retrospective's 11th program. The esthetic running through Warhol's films is an icy voyeurism. As witty or sexy or photogenic as Warhol's superstars may have been, their largely unstructured, crudely edited play-acting in front of his camera could also be cruelly revealing. Again and again, one has the feeling of confronting people with limited inner resources, desperate to be noticed at any cost. Many are prototypes for the colorful figures who populate Manhattan's downtown club scene. Taking it further, the Warhol superstar can also be viewed as the forerunner of the thousands of ordinary folks who seem more than eager to disclose their most intimate secrets on talk television.

"Film: 'Underground,' a Documentary:Survivors of 'Village' Bombing Interviewed - The New York Times","no injuries occurred; the object was to inflict material damage on symbolic targets — and the publication of a book and a news sheet. Early last year Emile de Antonio, a documentary film maker who is himself a radical, though scarcely a violent one, managed to get in touch with the Weather Underground. Mr. de Antonio and two associates, Mary Lampson and Haskell Wexler, spent two days in a Los Angeles house with the five, talked with them and filmed the talk. The result is ""Underground,"" which opened yesterday at the Regency Theater. It suffers from the crippling difficulties under which it was made. It is a film in chains. It is a series of failures, but they are not stupid or careless ones. They are intelligent failures, and if Mr. de Antonio's effort is largely a defeat, it is a defeat that he conducts with skill and integrity. His intention was to have the five—Kathy Boudin, Bernardine Dohrn, Cathy Wilkerson, Billy Ayers and Jeff Jones—reveal something of themselves. His sympathetic question is: What is a white, middle - class revolutionary group doing in America in the mid-70's?The answers he gets, despite his efforts, are largely schematic and abstract. The five have schooled themselves to be impersonal. They seem to understand that for a film they must come out a bit, but they rarely manage to. There are a few breakthroughs. Kathy Boudin recalls her dismay in Havana in 1961 when she found herself—a peace marcher—applauding a parade of Cuban tanks. Bernardine Dohrn gives a curious insight into her long journey from a comfortable middle class to armed concealment: ""I was more afraid growing up than I am now. Then it was paranoid; now it's real fear.""There is a hand wielding a coffee pot, and the red ribs of Bernardine Dohrn's sweater. They provide visual life, evidence that in fact we are seeing a film about five people. So do the faces of the three film makers; Mr. de Antonio's eye following that coffee pot has the impact of a cavalry charge. This is not intended to be facetious. The film makers have done marvelously well with these details, but the fact is, they have hardly anything else to film. The five will not allow their faces to be shown. So the camera shows their backs and their elbows. Talking faces, used by a film maker of Mr. de Antonio's skill and sensitivity, would have told us a lot about the five. But without the faces we have only the talk. It is good to have it—Weatherman played a small but significant part in the American radical movement, if only, paradoxically, to weaken it by violence—but the effect is claustrophobic. The film makers use clips of the war in Vietnam, peace marches and police charges to illustrate the talk and vary its pace. There is also a scene in which the five leave the house and interview people anonymously—we still don't see their faces—at an unemployment center. The unemployed are angry—what else would one expect? — and the five draw encouraging conclusions about an American revolution. This is naïve. It is frail. Weatherman got its name from the Bob Dylan line about not having to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing. Now it has changed its name to Weather Underground. But how do you tell the wind's direction underground?The film doesn't ask this question, but, despite its sympathy, it doesn't try to conceal it either. That is its honesty.

True, the young lady played by Miss Bennett in her picture, which came to the Gotham yesterday, is inspired by the most noble motives. She smuggles fallen fliers out of France. And she is assisted in this perilous business by an English lady, played by Gracie Fields. But, somehow, it is hard to imagine that the actual participants in that work were as la-de-da and frolicsome about it as are Miss Bennett and Miss Fields. You would think, to see the way they do it, that it was just a lot of cute, exciting sport and that visits from the Gestapo were occasions for goose-pimpled farce. Low point, perhaps, of indiscretion comes in a shakes-and-shudders scene when Miss Fields reports, with comic horror, that one of their French co-operators has been killed. Miss Bennett abets this grotesque nonsense. No, the lady's taste has not improved.

Richard RyenOne of the most curious anti-Nazi films yet to reach the screen is ""Strange Holiday,"" which opened yesterday at the Rialto. Arch Oboler, who is credited as author-director-producer, obviously believes that the military defeat of the Nazi war machine has not dashed the German's hope to some day rule the world. ""Strange Holiday"" is a warning to the soft-peace advocates, a prophecy of fascism to come in America if we all hop on the bandwagon which is propagating the myth that the German people had nothing to do with starting the war, that they were innocently led astray by Hitler and company. Mr. Oboler has a provocative thought there but in dramatizing it he has gone off on a melodramatic tangent. ""Strange Holiday"" is the story of two men on a vacation to the north woods who find upon emerging from their peaceful isolation that the country has come under the domination of fascist influences. Such a theme is fraught with dramatic possibilities, but Mr. Oboler has frittered it through a succession of sadistic sequences which smack of having been contrived for their shock effect. If this be a new form of cinematic impressionism then give us back the old days of simple, straight-forward story telling, for ""Strange Holiday"" only adds to confusion of thought on a serious matter. A cast of good players, headed by Claude Rains, aren't able to do much toward making this film comprehensible, for, in his direction, Mr. Oboler permits the story to ramble and his propensity for abruptly cutting sequences is confusing, rather than artistic.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. It is a tribute to the general honesty of intention and execution of ""Underground"" that the new film at the Globe achieves, particularly in its latter passages, a considerable emotional impact. As another descent into the demoniacal Walpurgisnacht of present-day Germany, it is a film neither distinguished nor original. Most of what it says is familiar, especially in its continuous emphasis on the bullying brutality of the Nazi minions. In its anxiety to match the contemporary events by mention of the Bismarck sinking or the Hess flight it merely betrays how inadequately fiction frequently tugs at the coattails of history. And yet, by virtue of a straightforward script and the conviction which Philip Dorn brings to the role of the revolutionary leader, ""Underground"" manages to tap some of the emotion which today binds freemen everywhere. Although the story of the underground radio leader and his ultimate and quizotic betrayal by his own brother follows an outline that has become stock in anti-Nazi films, it is not the story which is so much at fault as it is history. History need not be concerned whether or not its villains are believable, but drama must. Even if based on actuality, the characterization of the Gestapo agent is in the film too coldly inhuman to be credible, and his actions frequently pass the limit beyond which brutality can be shown on the screen. Beyond that borderline the drama ceases to move the heart and instead results simply in visceral shock. ""Underground,"" in the constant and deadly dangers that pursue the mobile broadcasting unit, has enough melodramatic excitement without accepting the whip and the torture chamber. Rather, the film has a gripping vitality when the leader's brother must allow the condemned man to think that his betrayal was conscious and thereby lull the Gestapo's suspicions as to his own future revolutionary activities. It is pointed when it shows a gemutlich German family bewildered by a nightmare world where truth and old loyalties are corrupted by the opportunist sophistries of the Nazi regime. Of the cast, Mr. Dorn adds greatly to the film's effect by the depth and sincerity of his performance. But the performance of Jeffrey Lynn, as the officer who becomes a revolutionist; Martin Kosleck as the Gestapo agent and Kaaren Verne and Mona Maris as a pair of underground conspirators are little better than routine. If ""Underground"" suffers by comparison with the history it describes it is still a worthy and often powerful account of the efforts of men of good-will amid the savagery of the Nazi state.

Screen: Exotic Import; Pather Panchali' From India Opens Here - The New York Times,"as the bits in the mosaic increase and a couple of basically human and dramatic incidents are dropped in, such as the pitiful death of the old woman and the sickness and death of the little girl—the poignant theme emerges and the whole thing-takes a slim poetic form. By the time it comes to its sad end, it has the substance of a tender threnody. Much of the effect is accomplished by some stunningly composed domestic scenes, well performed—or pictured—by an excellent Indian cast, and exquisitely photographed by Subrata Mitra in tastefully filtered blacks and whites. And a finely conceived and sympathetic original musical score, composed by Ravi Shankar, in which native instruments are employed, sets the whole sad story in the frame of a melancholy mood. Karuna Banerji is touching as the mother who is most distressed by poverty and Uma Das Gupta is lovely and sensitive as the girl. Chunibala Devi is fantastically realistic and effective as the aging crone and Subir Banerji is wistful and beguiling as the small son of the family. As we say, it is quite exotic. The dialogue often sounds like a Gramophone record going at high speed. English subtitles barely make some sense. But there are lovely little threads in the strange fabric.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.''Space Jam'' may well be the only film in which Looney Tunes characters openly discuss merchandising tie-ins. As Daffy Duck asks Bugs Bunny when the subject of mugs and T-shirts comes up, ''You ever see any money from that stuff?''Maybe Bugs doesn't, but somebody will. ''Space Jam'' is all about salesmanship, though it also turns out to be a reasonably good big-screen baby sitter for small children with savvy commercial tastes. It's both a frantic, innovative mixture of animation technologies and a fan magazine full of adulation for Michael Jordan. He handles this tribute with regal bearing and good grace. As a sports star so celebrated that even the backs of his ears are famous, Mr. Jordan need do little more here than show off his sportsmanship and play ball. (Typical line: ''Let's just go out and have fun.'') It's baseball at first, which gives the one enterprising twist to an otherwise near-plotless spectacle. Mr. Jordan is first seen giving up basketball to try baseball, and the film makes knowing jokes about this switch. After all, it saves Mr. Jordan from being nabbed by animated space aliens who bewitch the film's other basketball stars.(Parents who know they won't resist the juggernaut of ''Space Jam'' should take a popcorn break at this point. Skip the next two paragraphs. Also feel free to ignore this information when you see it on screen.)Somewhere in animated outer space, a bunch of brightly colored bugs called Nerdlucks need a new attraction for Moron Mountain, their amusement park. They decide to kidnap all the Looney Tunes characters. Then Bugs challenges the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. The Nerdlucks, being wily (and with Danny DeVito supplying the voice of their ringleader), morph themselves into big, mean basketball aces by sapping the talents of Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues and others. But the Nerdlucks don't catch Michael Jordan. Since they're from another planet, they are able to mistake him for a baseball player, which no real earthling would do. Still, Mr. Jordan does not stay out of the fray. He's out playing golf with Bill Murray and Larry Bird when he gets sucked down a hole and dragged into Looneyland for the big game. Back? Anyway, to make ''Space Jam,'' Mr. Jordan shot and dribbled among figures in special green suits, who were later replaced by animated versions of everyone from Tweety Bird to Foghorn Leghorn to Yosemite Sam. The juxtaposition of human and animated figures is very skillful, thanks to direction by Joe Pytka, a star director of television commercials. Mr. Pytka never need have a visual idea that lasts longer than 30 seconds here, thanks to the film's scriptless state and giddy, cacophonous style. This film was made very quickly by animation standards, and the haste shows.''Space Jam'' is also the brainchild of Ivan Reitman, who is one of the producers and whose own films (''Ghostbusters,'' ''Stripes,'' ''Kindergarten Cop'') also value high-concept thinking and loose, wisecracking style. In the energetic, mishmash manner of a Mad magazine parody, the film simply throws in every gag and non sequitur it can think of. (''I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture,'' says someone or something, misidentifying Mr. Murray.) Crammed with pop and sports references, the film also kids about its own crassness. One character succeeds in plugging Hanes, Wheaties, Gatorade and a Big Mac in a single sentence. Wayne Knight, as Mr. Jordan's devoted gofer, is around to provide comic relief, which means being squashed flat by the film's animation tricks. Also on hand, in all their collective glory, are the celebrities of the Looney Tunes world. ''Space Jam'' is as much a fond tribute to their past as it is a product-plugging, high-tech, hip-hopping thing of the future.''Space Jam'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Screen: Science + Sex = 'Barbarella':Jane Fonda Is Starred in Roger Vadim Film Violence and Gadgetry Set Tone of Movie - The New York Times,"which is not really science fiction, since it has no poetry or logic—is turned to all kinds of jokes, which are not jokes, but hard-breathing, sadistic thrashings, mainly at the expense of Barbarella, and of women. There are special effects, of no imagination. There is Marcel Marceau, the brilliant French mime, talking, in a particularly boring part. There are sex machines, and sex pills and even a sex hookah . . . in which a young man swims about while vampirish women lie there, breathing essence of man. Throughout the movie, there is the assumption that just mentioning a thing (sex, politics, religion) makes it funny and that mentioning it in some offensive context (an angel is jocularly. Daliesquely crucified; Barbarella is picturesquely, viciously bitten by some children's toys) makes it funnier. It is a humorist-advertiser's kind of experiment: Let's stab this through the midriff and see if anyone salutes it; let's throw in an allusion to faggotry and impotence. For a while, the audience catching all the pointless, witless modernist allusions feels in on something chic, and laughs. Then it is clear that there is nothing whatever to be in on—except another uninspired omnispoof. Women have been treated very strangely in movies lately—from the ancient biddy rapists with sticky, sandy eyes in ""The Producers,"" through Doris Day mocked, all the actresses oddly cast and photographed from unattractive angles, to Barbarella, bruised and chewed about. Maybe it is an anti-Mummy reflex, no good, decent women on the screen. It is as though the medium, particularly in mechanistic science fiction and pseudo boffo bachelor comedy, has grown to hate them. Jane Fonda does as well as she can in this one, throwing away a lot of lines better than they deserve. And David Hemmings does well in a cameo nothing part, as a space revolutionary. The rest has the effect of a bit of cosmically spiteful chaos in an interior decorator's salon, space, or a cosmetics factory.

"‘The Dead Man and Being Happy,’ by Javier Rebollo - The New York Times","Stories of humanized hit men make for a small but well-trod patch of screenwriting terrain, but “The Dead Man and Being Happy” quickly transcends that territory to become a beguiling road movie. Directed by Javier Rebollo and written with Lola Mayo and Salvador Roselli, this reserved, tragicomic story of existential flight across Argentina is defined by its shifting, literary voice-over about the textured, wide-screen expanses crossed by its protagonist. Santos (José Sacristán), the old man of the perplexing title, is dying of three tumors and living on morphine. He drives down winding countryside roads after botching his last job. A companion in exile, Érika (Roxana Blanco), materializes, plopping herself into the back seat of his old Ford and taking a while to reveal the family scandal behind her own wanderings. Santos remains a bit of a mystery, played by Mr. Sacristán as a once-tough guy who now just seems a sick, weary old man wearing tough-guy drag. Érika, recognizing this, becomes his caretaker through the back roads of an Argentina knowingly portrayed in its proud longueurs and its mystique of the past. The voice-over, delivered by Ms. Mayo and occasionally by Mr. Rebollo, begins clinically. But, as if reflecting off the performances and the people encountered on the trip, it gains resigned affection in its deadpan commentary. (Oddly, the film shares a number of details with “Bombón: El Perro,” which Mr. Roselli helped write, along with a very different kind of road movie of odd bonding, “Las Acacias.”) It’s a tonally intriguing usage, intensified here with absolute silences. Still, something about the movie falls through the cracks, as our curiosity grows more about Érika than the lumbering legend of Santos.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/movies/the-dead-man-and-being-happy-by-javier-rebollo.html

Shooting on richly textured 35-millimeter film, the cinematographer Robert Hauer translates Mr. Moshé’s evident love for the genre into images that honor their inspirations without mimicking them. And if things get a little baggy in the middle, just wait; when a woman in a western is as wedded to her firearm as Martha, there can be only two possible outcomes to her story.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/movies/dead-mans-burden-directed-by-jared-moshe.html
"‘Dead Man Down,’ Starring Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace - The New York Times","you just happily agree to go along with the fictional flow. Some directors never spin their lies successfully enough for this to happen, while others blow it with anachronisms, miscasting, shoddy filmmaking, dumb choices or merely a solitary false note. Other movies lose you, only to reel you back in tentatively with a jolt of intelligence or an image that sticks. Such is “Dead Man Down,” a thriller that piles on its absurdities so fast and with such apparent obliviousness that you hope (pray) you’ll soon be watching either a diverting art-film intervention, like Werner Herzog’s remake of “Bad Lieutenant,” or joy riding with one of those rarest of screen delights: the demented howler. “Dead Man Down,” unfortunately, turns out to be too innocuous to qualify as either actually good or delectably bad. Yet while Colin Farrell and his sensitive, hardworking eyebrows help keep it from becoming a full-bore lampoon, the gangland clichés, nutty plot and seemingly random casting choices (F. Murray Abraham, Armand Assante, Isabelle Huppert) stoke your hopes that true movie madness may rise out of the darkening shadows and pessimism. Mr. Farrell plays Victor, a thug with a secret past and skills who works for Alphonse (Terrence Howard), a New York drug dealer. Someone has been threatening Alphonse, and it’s getting to him. His initial solution involves gunning down an apartment filled with Jamaican drug dealers, part of a United Nations underworld that has turned New York into the Wild West (or a Luc Besson cartoon) teeming with bald Albanian gangsters and heavily armed Hungarians. The Swedish actress Noomi Rapace, who played the glowering lead in the original screen versions of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” trilogy, here plays Beatrice, a beautician with a disfigured face. Ms. Huppert plays Beatrice’s near-deaf mother; the British actor Dominic Cooper plays, appealingly, Victor’s friend. Victor and Beatrice meet when she waves at him from the apartment tower across from his while, in a nice humanizing touch, he vacuums his pad. After some filler they go out on a date that swerves from ho-hum to hilarious when she whips out her cell and plays a video of Victor choking someone to death in front of his window, a twist that makes him seem pretty dumb for an ostensibly brilliant guy and reminds you of how great “Rear Window” truly is. If Victor refuses to kill the man who disfigured her, she snarls, tapping her inner Ann Savage for a few memorable moments (Savage was a star of the desperate noir classic “Detour”), she will go to the coppers. Beatrice doesn’t say coppers, which is too bad, because the movie might have been better if its Danish director, Niels Arden Oplev, had played with the genre clichés stuffed in this turkey instead of going for straight-up action. There’s talent in “Dead Man Down” — you laugh, but you also keep watching — even if it’s unclear whether J. H. Wyman wrote the script with his tongue wedged deep in his cheek, or if Mr. Oplev inadvertently pushed the movie to the brink of comedy. (Mr. Wyman’s credits include the science-fiction series “Fringe”; Mr. Oplev directed the first “Dragon Tattoo” movie.)Then again, by the time the Hungarian engineer drives his truck into a mansion and springs from the wreckage with gun blazing, the question of whether all this was intentionally ridiculous is moot. “Dead Man Down” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Summer Love - Movies - Review - The New York Times,"the open range, a Hollywood back lot — to an anonymous, near-abstract space where the genre codes roam as free as the buffalo and the heroes and the villains play. If it sounds like a bad joke — think “Once Upon a Time in Poland,” “The Good, the Bad and the Polish” or even “A Fistful of Poles” — it isn’t, quite. (It’s actually a fairly decent one.) Mr. Uklanski is a serious artist, or at least a semiserious artist, whose works have been exhibited around the world, including at the Museum of Modern Art. Among his most well-known is “The Nazis,” an installation (and later a book) of photographs of actors like Clint Eastwood, Marlon Brando, Yul Brynner and David Niven glammed up in National Socialist costume, a project that owes a strong debt to Susan Sontag’s important 1974 essay “Fascinating Fascism,” if without the corresponding intellectual rigor and moral unease. Shot in southern Poland, “Summer Love” — the title matches the syrupy song oozing on the soundtrack — features a sorry collection of nameless archetypes amassed around a ramshackle town under a brilliant blue, blazingly bright sky. Among the players are the Stranger (Karel Roden), a gunslinger who wears black and bleeds red; the Woman (Katarzyna Figura), a busty barmaid whose monstrous tongue would make Gene Simmons blush; the Sheriff (Boguslaw Linda), a broken-down alcoholic carrying a sputtering torch for the barmaid; and the Big Man (Krzysztof Zaleski), a not-so-big man in filthy garb who lusts after the woman. Rather mysteriously, Val Kilmer pops up as the Wanted Man, a designation that may have more to do with celebrity than function. Nothing much happens, which is to the filmmaker’s purpose. “Summer Love” isn’t a standard western but a series of loosely ordered, vaguely chronological narrative shards and iconographic images that will be familiar to anyone who has a casual acquaintance with the genre. Thus instead of a story and plot there are fired guns, dusty boots, grizzled beards, clanking spurs and galloping, whinnying, falling horses. Blood and booze and spit flow, along with the scripted clichés spoken in Polish-accented English. One man builds a scaffold and fashions a noose, another man loses his head and the barmaid loses her knickers. If this sounds like a Sergio Leone film, it is, kind of, sort of, if not as beautiful, pleasurable or profound. There’s a flicker of a political critique embedded in Mr. Uklanski’s playful intervention and mocking tone, something about the displacement of the American cowboy ideology, though the film finally weighs in as more cynical and detached than passionate and engaged. In “Summer Love” the western is little more than a collection of disintegrated parts, frayed bits and shabby pieces of some formerly coherent idea, a vague suggestion of an ideal (democratic, cinematic) that has become as blurred as a copy of a copy of a copy. Mr. Uklanski keeps the joke going even over the final credits, with Lorne Greene, the paterfamilias from the television western series “Bonanza,” growling the 1960s song “I’m a Gun.” There’s something ominous about this kitsch ballad, which is precisely the point.

Dead Man's Shoes - Review - Movies - The New York Times,"With its raw, grainy texture and forceful sense of urgency, Shane Meadows's unsparing revenge thriller ""Dead Man's Shoes"" is reminiscent of a kind of film prominent in the 1970's, most notably Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs."" Like a cross between that film's antihero, a nonthreatening everyman forced to take violent measures, and the unraveling war veteran Travis Bickle from ""Taxi Driver,"" the always fantastic Paddy Considine evokes both sensitivity and explosiveness as Richard, a troubled ex-soldier who returns to his hometown in northern England with payback on his mind. The power of the performance by Mr. Considine, who wrote the script with Mr. Meadows, is even more extraordinary, considering that his character's complex psyche is woefully unexplored, and that there are long stretches in which he is absent from the screen. The main attraction is the gang of loathsome thugs who horribly mistreated Richard's mentally disabled younger brother years earlier, as they are at first harmlessly toyed with before meeting much direr fates at the hands of their personal grim reaper. That bloody retribution makes ""good guys"" the equals of the original wrongdoers is an overused moral, and this film, though told with style and authority, ultimately doesn't have anything fresh to say. Despite some hints at conscience and humanity, ""Dead Man's Shoes"" is a typical slasher film at the core; Richard even wears a mask as he cruelly and methodically picks off his victims. Dead Man's ShoesOpens today in Manhattan. Directed by Shane Meadows; written by Paddy Considine and Mr. Meadows; director of photography, Danny Cohen; edited by Chris Wyatt, Lucas Roche and Celia Haining; art director, Adam Tomlinson; produced by Mark Herbert; released by Magnolia Pictures.

FILM REVIEW; A Novel Way to Get All A's - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from August 21, 1998, Section E, Page 30Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. You'd like Cooper. Everybody does. He's a good-looking rich boy who arrives for his freshman year in college with chilled martini glasses in the mini-bar, an abundance of drugs and more charm than the law should allow. His mottos are ''College is our last chance to go crazy'' and ''Bad grades are meaningless. They're like parking tickets.'' Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, who was Zack Morris on NBC's ''Saved by the Bell'') parties every night, cuts all his classes every day and is big trouble for his roommate Josh. Josh (Tom Everett Scott, who was the sensitive nice guy in ''That Thing You Do!'') is a sensitive nice guy from Indiana, a serious pre-med student with a heavy course load and a full academic scholarship. But by midterm he's a changed man, under Cooper's hedonistic influence, and in big trouble (straight F's).''Dead Man on Campus'' is a predictably dumb movie made for very young audiences, playing to youth's love of excess and loaded with masturbation jokes. Mr. Gosselaar is so good, however, that his performance as Cooper sometimes overrides the film's adolescent tone. Only one thing can save Josh from losing his scholarship and Cooper from flunking out and being forced to work in his father's toilet-cleaning business, ''in the field.'' Because of an obscure, longstanding rule at their college, a man in a bar tells Josh and Cooper, ''If your roommate kills himself, you get straight A's.'' So they set out to find the most depressed guy in school and move him into the extra bed. The original third roommate decamped early, to live with his new girlfriend. If a student is going to kill himself anyway, they reason, he might as well do it in their room. The first candidate is Cliff (Lochlyn Munro, who appears to have stolen Gary Busey's facial expression), a hyperkinetic beer guzzler who is too rowdy for his Kappa Omega fraternity brothers. Cliff's idea of a pleasant evening is shooting at local police officers from a speeding car and setting a girl's hair on fire. The second, Buckley (Randy Pearlstein, whose look is a cross between John Lennon and Christopher Walken), is convinced that Bill Gates is after his brain. Buckley also reveals to his new friends that Kurt Cobain and Vincent Foster are both alive and living at Mount St. Helen's. The third, Matt (Corey Page, who has an all-purpose MTV look), is a nihilistic rock singer who reads Camus. His signature song is called ''Sperm.'' But it turns out he has a few dark secrets involving television and show tunes. All three would-be suicides are over the top and fun to watch. Too bad the film they're in seems to have been at least partly written and directed by Beavis and Butt-head.''Dead Man on Campus'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains constant profanity, sexual situations, partial nudity and some violence, most but not all of it slapstick. DEAD MAN ON CAMPUSDirected by Alan Cohn; written by Michael White and Michael Traeger; director of photography, John Thomas; edited by Debra Chiate; production designer, Carol Winstead Wood; produced by Gale Anne Hurd; released by Paramount Pictures.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Dead Man,"" Jim Jarmusch's sardonic nightmare vision of the Old West, begins with a display of grotesquerie that is so sensational it sets up expectations that the movie might be the surreal last word on the Hollywood western and its mythic legacy. Those expectations, unfortunately, are not fulfilled. The film's energy begins to flag after less than an hour, and as its pulse slackens it turns into a quirky allegory, punctuated with brilliant visionary flashes that partially redeem a philosophic ham-handedness. Audiences attuned to Mr. Jarmusch's drolly hip sensibility should be delighted with the film, but to the uninitiated, its drier patches are just as likely to induce yawns. This story of a young man's passage through a frontier crawling with violence, death and decay begins on a train whose soot-faced fireman (Crispin Glover) delivers an ominous prediction. Appearing in the car where William Blake (Johnny Depp), the film's protagonist, is playing solitaire, he warns Blake that when he reaches his destination, the town of Machine, he will find his own grave. As the train hurtles westward, Blake, incongruously duded up in a floppy bow tie and checkered suit, finds himself surrounded by silent, gun-toting geezers with wizened faces. Peering out the window, he sees the tattered remains of abandoned covered wagons and other signs of decay. When the train passes a buffalo herd, his fellow passengers clamber to the windows with rifles and blindly open fire. Machine turns out to be a rutted backwater hellhole dominated by the Dickinson Metalworks, the company that is supposedly going to employ Blake as an accountant. But on showing up at the place, he is informed by the leering office manager (John Hurt) that the post has been filled. When he confronts the owner, John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum), he is ordered at gunpoint to leave at once or else he will soon be ""pushing up daisies.""Stranded and nearly penniless, Blake visits a bar where he meets Thell Russell (Mili Avital), an attractive woman who takes him back to her shabby rented room strewn with paper flowers she has made. While they're in bed together, Thell's distraught former boyfriend, Charlie Dickinson (the company owner's son, played by Gabriel Byrne), appears and shoots at Blake but kills Thell instead. Blake shoots Charlie with Thell's gun, and jumps out a window, but not before he himself is critically wounded. Blake suddenly finds himself a fugitive with a bullet in his chest and a bounty on his head. From here, the movie changes from a horrifying evocation of the frontier into something more problematic and self-conscious. Pursued by bounty hunters and law officers, Blake makes his way westward until he reaches the Pacific, leaving a trail of carnage behind him. For much of the way he is accompanied by a gruff, facetious Indian guide named Nobody (Gary Farmer), who has dressed his wounds and believes his companion to be the reincarnation of the English poet William Blake. When Nobody tells his story, it turns out that he, too, is a sort of fugitive. Captured as a boy by white men, he was taken East and exploited as a sideshow attraction and from there to England, where he was educated and discovered Blake's poetry. The Indian appoints himself the poet's guide back into the spirit world. When ""Dead Man"" succumbs to its own allegorical pretensions, it becomes a slogging philosophic exercise whose dialogue never comes close to matching the energy of its malevolent characters and the novelty of its visual images. Shot in black-and-white, the movie beautifully sustains a vision of the West as wild in the most primal and scary sense of the word. Its talk is another matter. Mr. Jarmusch's screenplay has Nobody address Blake in a joking profanity-laced slang that has a sly contemporary ring. That dialogue is right in tune with Neil Young's jangling, scraggly electric guitar score, which twangs portentously on the soundtrack. The clash between the film's two styles has little resonance. The movie picks up a new flash of energy and humor whenever a weird new character stumbles into view. Some of its livelier moments focus on an eccentric trio of hired killers, the meanest of whom (Lance Henriksen) is rumored to have raped both his parents and eaten them. Equally intriguing are a trio of animal skinners whom Nobody and Blake happen upon as they are eating beans around a campfire. The oddest of the three (Iggy Pop) is a gaunt old hunter dressed in pioneer-lady drag who regales his comrades with the story of the Three Bears. When ""Dead Man"" is imagining the Wild West as an infernal landscape of death, it is furiously alive. When it tries to reflect on those images, it begins to nod out.""Dead Man"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and violence.

Review/Film; Soviet Eye Examines Atom War - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from January 27, 1989, Section C, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. What do you look for in a Soviet film that, like the American television series ''The Day After'' in 1983, depicts the ultimate human drama -death and survival after the nuclear holocaust? There are those in the West who have long suspected that the Soviet Government, always carefully controlling its own peace movement, wanted to encourage greater fear of the nuclear catastrophe among other people than among its own citizens. But ''Letters From a Dead Man,'' which, after the Chernobyl disaster, drew long lines of viewers in the Soviet Union, shows no marks of the political censor, no effort to lighten the vision of suffering. If there is any optimism in this film, directed by Konstantin Lopushansky and on view at the Public Theater through Feb. 2, it comes only at the end, in offering some faint albeit ambiguous hope that even after the war there might yet be a human future. Mr. Lopushinsky is technically equal to the task of creating the sort of ultimate on-screen horror called for by the very concept of the nuclear holocaust. He achieves a splendid goulishness with scenes of a remarkable world that, as one character puts it, has become a ''void under a cold sky.''The film centers on a group of survivors in a museum whose director is a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, played with understated resignation by Rolan Bykov. The group lives in a basement bunker of the museum, sharing meals, reflecting on man's tragic fate, dying and burying their dead in the grimy soil of the cellar. They listen to the sound of the holocaust, an eerie howling, that penetrates to their ashen-gray subterranean world. Above the bunker is nightmare; bodies strewn in a watery rubble, hardy pedestrians in gas masks and rubber suits stumbling through the wreckage that itself broods inside a misty twilight. The professor reflects on the disaster, writing letters in his head to a lost son. He searches for some reason, a scientific one on which a hypothesis can be built, to believe that the world may yet survive. The capacity for self-delusion is one of the few characteristics of mankind that can survive even the nuclear winter. One of the unnamed professor's colleagues, not sharing that characteristic, shoots himself after lying down in a new grave. But just before he does, he reads aloud a literary time capsule he has prepared for whatever future civilization may arise. This letter from a dead man proclaims that mankind ''was a tragic species doomed perhaps from the very beginning'' because of its ''drive to be better than nature intended.'' He says, ''I love mankind; I love it even better now that it no longer exists.''Mr. Lopushinsky's vision is convincing at times. At others it seems to consist of a meandering sort of guesswork about what nuclear war really would be like, and in those moments ''Letters from a Dead Man'' becomes another movie about the horrors of war, all war, not necessarily nuclear war. Perhaps something is lost in the subtitles, but, even while striving for a Dostoyevskyan depth, ''Letters from a Dead Man,'' despite its technical virtues, seems just a bit too contrived to truly convince, much less to deeply move. Yet, in stripping the ideological gloss from the vision of ultimate calamity, Mr. Lopushinsky does succeed in creating a cultural artifact that makes the specter of the most dreadful possible event common to both sides of the superpower divide. Hope, Faint And Ambiguous LETTERS FROM A DEAD MAN, directed by Konstantin Lopushansky; screenplay (Russian with English subtitles) by Mr. Lopushansky, Vyacheslav Rybakov and Boris Strugatsky; photography by Nikolai Prokoptsev; music by Leonid Gavrichenko; art directors, Yelena Amshinskaya and Viktor Ivanov; produced by Lenfilm Studio; released by New Yorker Films.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. THROUGH a series of incredible but entertaining coincidences, two pregnant women exchange identities at the beginning of ''I Married a Shadow,'' the romantic thriller by Robin Davis that opens today at the Paris Theater. Based on a novel by William Irish, (with the title ''I Married a Dead Man,'' which captures the situation much more accurately), the movie has a tricky and convoluted plot that recalls Hitchcock, even if Mr. Davis's direction doesn't often do the same. Much of the old-fashioned suspense is undoubtedly attributable to Mr. Irish, who also wrote ''Rear Window'' as well as ''The Bride Wore Black.''''I Married a Shadow'' begins as Hel ene (Nathalie Baye) is being berated by her lover, Frank, who is foul-tempered and unemployed. Moments later, he throws her out of his car and abandons her, even though she is eight months pregnant. With nowhere to go and no other family, Hel ene is desperate, and on a whim she decides to take a train south. On the train, she meets a woman named Patricia Meyrand and her new husband Bertrand. They are en route to Bordeaux, where Patricia is to meet her in-laws for the first time. Further coincidence leads Hel ene to don a dress of Patricia's, as well as her wedding ring, just before the train crashes. Hel ene awakens in a hospital to find that her baby has been born, Patricia and Bertrand have been killed, and the Meyrand family is eager to take her home. Never having met their new daughter-in-law, they have mistaken Hel ene for her. And Hel ene's efforts to correct the error are understandably only half- hearted. After all, she had nowhere to go. And the Meyrands are wealthy vintners with another son, Pierre (Francis Huster), who is handsome, unmarried and terribly concerned about his new sister-in-law's welfare. Out of this contrived but intriguing situation, Mr. Irish's novel wove a series of further perils and coincidences. The audience will see most of these coming well before they arrive, but they're enjoyable anyhow. Mr. Davis tends to underscore the action in ways that worked better for Hitchcock than they do for him (as when, on two occasions, he positions Hel ene and her handsome new brother-in-law in profile, with flames between them in the background, to indicate that theirs is a tempestuous relationship). However, his direction is generally simple and streamlined. And it suits the material, even if it never quite makes the most of it. Miss Baye, the subdued and accomplished French actress whose ubiquity is beginning to rival Isabelle Huppert's, makes a sympathetic heroine if not a particularly demonstrative one. Her performance is careful and restrained, and only in those few moments (romping through the vineyards with Pierre) when she must register wild happiness is she in the least bit unconvincing. During most of the story, Hel ene/Patricia is tense and apprehensive, qualities Miss Baye conveys very well. In the small role of the nasty Frank, Richard Bohringer is suitably coarse and temperamental. One more character in the mystery is Fifo (Victoria Abril), the beautiful and jealous vineyard hand who loves Pierre and resents the newcomer bitterly. Miss Abril tosses her hair and flashes her eyes a lot, and in one memorable sequence she and Pierre are seen at a party, enjoying themselves in a hearty peasant manner with some of the other workers. Mr. Davis, to convey this, brings on a troupe of guitar-playing folk singers, who sing merrily and slap one another's backs and drink wine from the bottle. The movie fares better in its more coolly understated moments.

The acting, if, indeed, that's what one would call those gyrations and speeches by Lon Chaney, Jean Parker et al, was apparently hampered by the significant absence of anything to act about.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. There's nothing like a vintage exploitation movie to resurrect the fashion eyesores and stale political rhetoric of a bygone era with what in retrospect seems like a vengeful sense of parody. In Jack Hill's 1975 film ""Switchblade Sisters,"" ""Blackboard Jungle"" meets ""Foxy Brown"" meets ""Charlie's Angels"" on the streets of a graffiti-spattered Anycity, U. S. A. The movie, whose director was in fact responsible for the blaxploitation films ""Foxy Brown"" and ""Coffy,"" was a flop when first released 21 years ago but has become a cult favorite, blessed by Quentin Tarantino. It focuses on the Jezebels, a bunch of knife-wielding teen-age ""chippies"" (to use the language of F. X. Maier's screenplay), who strut, swagger and sneer like Valley Girls imitating Humphrey Bogart. Although they occasionally don leather motorcycle caps and boots, most of the time they dress and talk like Sandra Dee's heirs, bickering and squealing in petulant fits of hair-pulling hysteria. The Jezebels' male counterparts, the Silver Blades, are a group of torpid, flabby leather boys who run drug and prostitution rings in the local high school. Their rivals are a slightly more modish-looking bunch who favor gaudy shirts with floppy shoulder-width collars unbuttoned to the chest to show off their hideously clunky medallions. The movie's opening scene finds the Jezebels playing teen-age Robin Hood as they surround a bullying bill collector in an elevator, brandish their knives, slice up his clothes and steal his money. Their sisterly solidarity only begins to crack when the new girl in the neighborhood, Maggie (Joanne Nail), shows up and catches the eye of the Blades' leader, Dominic (Asher Brauner), who follows her home one night and rapes her. Dominic happens to be the boyfriend of the Jezebels' leader, Lace (Robbie Lee), who is so besotted that she dispatches Maggie with a gooey love poem that he reads aloud for his buddies' mocking amusement. Although Maggie rather enjoyed being molested, she remains loyal to Lace. But Lace, sensing trouble, allows her icy lieutenant, Patch (Monica Gayle), to stoke her jealousy. And the tensions between Lace and Maggie steadily escalate.""Switchblade Sisters"" finds plenty of ways to keep the movie afloat until the climactic knife fight between the two. It throws the Jezebels into jail where they beat up a sadistic lesbian matron. Later on, it puts them smack in the middle of two ludicrous gang wars. The first, set in a roller rink, has the pratfalling comic energy of a ballet improvised on banana peels. In the second, the Jezebels team up with a black female gang of Maoist guerrillas whose Afro-coiffed leader, Muff (Marlene Clark), rumbles through the streets in a crude homemade tank. To watch ""Switchblade Sisters"" is to visit a never-never land of shopworn media images colliding in a tabloid high school of the mind where chippies and soul sisters gather to ""off the pigs"" and bring power to the people. It is also a place where the only thing that really matters is holding onto your unworthy louse of a boyfriend.

Mouth to Mouth - Review - Movies - The New York Times,"""Mouth to Mouth,"" Alison Murray's chaotic, semiautobiographical account of a teenage girl's misadventures in a traveling cult, occupies its own stylistic niche: the movie as acid flashback. Its antiheroine, Sherry (Ellen Page), is a sullen rebel recruited from the streets of Berlin into Spark (Street People Armed With Radical Knowledge), a roving band of recovering addicts, former prostitutes and damaged runaways. As they drift around Europe in a van, scavenging food from Dumpsters and working as grape pickers, their charismatic leader, Harry (Eric Thal), rants about giving ""homeless people a course in intellectual self-defense."" The total freedom he promises is really oppression. The girls' heads are shaved, and cult members are encouraged to take part in a paranoid system of spying, lying and tattling on one another. Rule breakers are lowered into a pit for 36 hours. When Sherry's mother, Rose (Natasha Wightman), arrives to fetch her, she becomes an enthusiastic cult member, much to her daughter's chagrin. Realistic scenes spiral into tentative modern dances that undermine their authenticity. The upbeat ending can't erase the lingering aura of being trapped in an insane asylum with the Manson family.

Hello? Is That Ms. Right Who's Breathing Heavily? - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from September 5, 1997, Section C, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Although the comic possibilities of phone sex have long since been exhausted, the Spanish farce ''Mouth to Mouth'' still gives this well-worn topic a try. As in Spike Lee's ''Girl 6,'' the main character is an aspiring actor who finds that auditioning for roles is no less humiliating than being paid to talk dirty to strangers, and that the phone job may actually be the more interesting professional challenge. So Victor (Javier Bardem), who has the look of an overgrown schoolboy along with the hunky swagger of an Antonio Banderas wannabe, throws himself into this new form of acting exercise. Just as Girl 6 dreamed of Dorothy Dandridge, he imagines himself as Travis Bickle at critical moments and turns the duties of phone sex into an escapist ploy. Manuel Gomez Pereira's film strives for escapism in its own uneasy way, mixing soft-core seduction with giddy pratfalls. For instance, there is a zipper mishap to interrupt one of several strained heavy-breathing episodes. All of the characters in this Madrid-based story are predictably excitable, to the point where the film sorely needs the antic talents of Pedro Almodovar. When elaborate plot complications seem ready to raise the film to a fever pitch it never reaches one, despite the strenuous efforts of Mr. Bardem and the rest of the cast. Events escalate once Victor, who took the phone sex job without expecting to meet Ms. Right, finds himself falling for a femme fatale named Amanda (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), who is one of his elusive clients. She says that her husband has also had tele-sex with Victor, which naturally leads to ever more outlandish complications. As it turns out, most of the characters are play-acting, which gives ''Mouth to Mouth'' (a catchier ''Boca a Boca'' in Spanish) its chance to weigh in on show business and artificiality. One of the film's funnier bits has Victor being told by his spitfire of an agent (Maria Barranco) that he looks too American to land a role in a big American movie. To overcompensate for this, he turns up with open shirt and slicked-back hair, smoldering histrionically as he kisses the hand of an American talent agent. (The film's ear for vulgar Americanisms is notably weak, as when it gives this woman the line ''Let's go, chap!'')Later on, Victor encounters a bratty American filmmaker whose combination of ignorance and arrogance makes an easy target. Victor launches into a furious diatribe in a restaurant after the boy wonder orders Coca-Cola, but he winds up impressing everyone with one more inadvertent show of his acting talent. Meanwhile, the film adds tranvestite waiters to this scene, sets some of its action in a phone sex disco and lets Ms. Sanchez-Gijon appear in blond, red and dark wigs at different moments. Despite these festive nods, the Almodovar touch has left the building and was never really here.''Mouth to Mouth'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual trysts that are mostly jokey and some lewd innuendos. There is also a quick glimpse of explicit gay porn.

This would be funnier if fewer of us found it so true. But Mr. Ramis turned such frustrations into clever comedy with ""Groundhog Day,"" and he tries for similarly mind-bending, wistful humor here. His hero is a yuppie Everyman, Doug Kinney (named for the film maker's late friend and collaborator Doug Kenney, with whom he wrote ""National Lampoon's Animal House""), who has an aggravating job in the construction business and a demanding home life to keep him frazzled. Doug's work is thankless as he builds a development called Vista de Nada and is saddled with extra responsibilities for no more pay. (""I think it's probably more of a prestige thing, hon,"" he tells his wife when she asks if he got a raise.) To relax, he supposedly plays golf. Actually Doug never touches a golf club and has no free time at all, unless he counts the hours spent stuck in traffic. Something's got to give. And it does on the day when Doug meets Dr. Owen Leeds (Harris Yulin) and then meets him again. It seems that there are two Dr. Leedses, one dressed studiously in a bow tie and the other in a Hawaiian shirt redolent of leisure. ""These problems are not in your mind,"" the doctor says sympathetically, upon hearing about Doug's pressure-cooker existence. ""They're real.""Dr. Leeds explains that he has cloned himself. And Doug finds the idea intriguing. Soon there are assorted Dougs (Michael Keaton, Michael Keaton, Michael Keaton and Michael Keaton) crossing paths awkwardly at Doug's workplace and arguing about who gets to sleep with Doug's wife (Andie MacDowell). Mr. Keaton, like Eddie Murphy in ""The Nutty Professor,"" rises ably to the challenge of holding heated conversations with weirdly refracted versions of himself.""So, uh, where you from?"" asks the real Doug when he meets No. 2, the first and most macho of his clones. That wisecrack captures ""Multiplicity"" at its sneaky best, which occasionally echoes the knotty ingenuity of ""Groundhog Day."" But the screenplay (by Chris Miller, Mary Hale, Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel and Mr. Ramis) isn't often that sharp, perhaps because it must dilute Doug into four separate characters when his workaday existence barely holds enough interest for one. ""Multiplicity"" weaves such an uninteresting plot around its bland, generic principals that it rarely reaches the absurdist heights its premise demands. Ms. MacDowell, at her most pliant and charming, is once again used to sweeten an acerbic leading man (a la Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day""). But her main job here is playing straight woman to a string of changeable Dougs, staying dense even though the audience can easily tell these guys apart. No. 1 is the henpecked original Doug, who wishes they broke the mold long before dim-witted, Jim Carreyish Four emerges as a genetic mishap. (""You know how sometimes you make a copy of a copy, it's not quite as sharp as the original?"" one clone says about Four.) Three is a sensitive homebody with a special knack for wrapping leftovers, which certainly presents Mr. Keaton with an amusing acting challenge. Two is the belligerent type, the clone most likely to leave Doug jobless and friendless. One funny bit finds Two trying to seduce a co-worker while the original Doug and his wife are at the same restaurant. ""She's sleeping with another guy,"" Two confides to his date about Doug's wife. ""She doesn't even know I exist."" True. For all of Mr. Keaton's obvious ingenuity, the different Dougs don't work as facets of one coherent character, which leaves their interaction a lot less revealing than it could be. The film's special effects aren't seamless either, sometimes leaving it too apparent that the star did much of his acting in a vacuum. And when ""Multiplicity"" settles for slapstick -- will anyone at the office notice two Dougs in two different shirts? -- it takes the dull way out of a potentially lively crisis. It's less interesting to watch Doug duck strangers than to see him argue with himself. ""Multiplicity"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity and several seduction scenes.

‘Mike Wallace Is Here’ Review: A Ticktock of a Newsman’s Life - The New York Times,"and how he worked assiduously to dispel that idea. A roll call of Wallace’s famous interviews could go on for many paragraphs. The highlight reel might include his 1957 discussion on “The Mike Wallace Interview” with the gangster Mickey Cohen, who asserted that he had “killed no men that in the first place didn’t deserve killing.” In 1979, Wallace asked the Ayatollah Khomeini about President Anwar Sadat of Egypt’s assessment of him as a “lunatic.” We hear about the potential chilling effect of a libel lawsuit against CBS that Gen. William C. Westmoreland, who commanded the United States forces in Vietnam, eventually dropped; and of Wallace’s interview with the Brown & Williamson whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand that the network stalled on airing. Interviews with more peripheral figures often serve to turn a mirror on Wallace. We see how he was able to move the “queen of mean” Leona Helmsley to tears by probing her on the death of a son, an experience that Wallace shared. Wallace’s interview with the former Eisenhower assistant cabinet member Thomas P. Pike is used to bolster a strand on his own struggles with depression. Wallace is also shown in friendly sit-downs with several of his “60 Minutes” colleagues, with whom he sometimes seems less guarded. Belkin allows most of the clips to speak for themselves, at least visually; almost everyone shown is recognizable on sight, although there are identifications in the closing credits for viewers who want them. There are times when you wish Belkin wouldn’t cut away so quickly and would allow answers to tough questions (or Wallace’s own words) to play in full. The musical scoring — the Chromatics’ widely used composition “Tick of the Clock” alludes to the opening of “60 Minutes” and provides an insistent, paranoia-inducing backbeat — has the effect of providing goosing where none is needed. This isn’t a thriller; Wallace’s life offers enough drama, self- and otherwise. Mike Wallace Is HereRated PG-13. Language unfit to air.

"Review: In ‘Reset,’ a Mother Enters a Wormhole to Save Her Son - The New York Times","Rule No. 1 for overstressed mothers engaged in top-secret research that might make them the target of an enemy: Don’t let the babysitter leave your child alone. That is the first mistake Xia Tian (Yang Mi) makes in “Reset” as she tries to balance her life with her work: opening a wormhole to parallel universes. Sure enough, a ruthless operative (Wallace Huo) from a competing company is on the loose, willing to do anything to get the data Xia Tian and her colleagues are working on. Because the process has not been completely successful, Xia Tian’s lab has prohibited human subjects from entering the portal. But she takes the chance and bursts through when her little son’s life is at stake to fight her competitor. To say that this tense sci-fi thriller, directed by Chang (born Yoon Hong-seung) and produced by Jackie Chan, has a strong female lead is an understatement. Thanks to the portal, we are treated to three simultaneous manifestations of Xia Tian, which is about one more than we can easily keep track of when they are engaged in a gun battle. There is shooting and stabbing galore, a clever kidnapping-by-truck routine and breathtaking car chases, as well as a harrowing scene of our heroine sliding down a long conveyor belt that feeds a bubbling caldron of waste. Over all, this is an exciting film if not a completely cohesive one, but Xia Tian’s ultimate decision about her career is a disappointment. One more thing: Think twice about using retinal biometrics for identification. (You’ll see).",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/movies/reset-review.html
When  Richard P. Rogers Turned the Camera on Himself - The New York Times,"One of the many questions that tormented the gifted documentarian Richard P. Rogers, who spent years working on a filmed autobiography left incomplete when he died in 2001, was whether the project had any meaning or value. Or was it, as he put it, just aestheticized “autoeroticism”? Pieces of that film, assembled by Alexander Olch, a friend and former student, make up the bulk of “The Windmill Movie,” a version of the autobiography that might have been. (Mr. Olch is credited as director, writer and editor.) Largely made up of excerpts from 200 hours of footage shot by Mr. Rogers that was left in boxes labeled “Windmill,” it reveals his eye for creating voluptuous, evocative cinematic tableaus that have luminous inner life. Women sunning themselves on the beaches of the Hamptons; clouds over white-capped waves; immaculate tennis courts; friends and family members circulating on the manicured lawns of southeastern Long Island; the Wainscott windmill, a landmark that Mr. Rogers’s maternal grandfather had moved from Montauk to Georgica Pond and that stands as the film’s enigmatic unifying symbol: such images depict Mr. Rogers’s upper-class background as a paradise of privilege. Except that it wasn’t. Mental illness plagued Mr. Rogers’s family to the extent that he and his wife, the noted Magnum photographer Susan Meiselas, whom he met in 1970 but didn’t marry until shortly before his death at 57 from brain cancer, decided not to risk passing on “mutant genes.” As many artists born to wealth are wont do, Mr. Rogers, who attended Harvard and later taught film there, beat himself up about his unearned good fortune. A theme that runs through “The Windmill Movie” is his insecurity and professional jealousy, of Steven Spielberg in particular. Even though Mr. Rogers is widely recognized as an important documentarian, he tended to see himself as a failure. “The Windmill Movie” is really two films woven together by Mr. Olch to complete the story of Mr. Rogers’s life. The first part consists largely of Mr. Rogers’s work in progress, which included eight-millimeter films shot by his father that date as far back as the 1930s. Strangely, none of his 18 documentary and experimental films are even mentioned. Toward the end of the film, Mr. Olch becomes a vocal presence. Taking over narration that Mr. Rogers began, Mr. Olch reads text he wrote himself in an impersonal voice, and the movie becomes a self-conscious, experimental exercise. In one sequence, the playwright and actor Wallace Shawn, who was a close friend of Mr. Rogers’s, is shown holding a camera and pretending to film himself in a mirror (something Mr. Rogers is seen doing earlier in the movie). Mr. Shawn remarks that now that Mr. Rogers is terminally ill, he doesn’t have to worry about the future because he doesn’t have one. The movie comes to life in Mr. Rogers’s confessional recollections. He remembers the evening cocktail hour, a supposedly idyllic ritual of family togetherness, as a daily nightmare in which his parents got drunk and fought. His mother, a bitter grande dame shown sitting in a lawn chair with a drink in her hand and wearing a mink coat in summer, emerges as an anti-Semitic tyrant who threw her son and Ms. Meiselas (who is Jewish) out of the house on a Fourth of July weekend after a dispute about defrosting a refrigerator. Relating his romantic history of juggling women, cheating and lying, Mr. Rogers comes across as an unapologetically selfish, deceitful womanizer. Illness and death give “The Windmill Movie” narrative closure. Near the end we see fleeting glimpses of his once fearsome mother, who died before him, her face cavernous, diminished by cancer. A prelude to Mr. Rogers’s own decline was an accident in which he lost three toes. A malignant melanoma and brain cancer were to follow. “The Windmill Movie” leaves a paradoxical impression. As much as Mr. Rogers fretted about the difficulty of revealing his true self, the movie lays out a detailed map of his psyche but very little sense of what it was like to know him. His reputation as a charming, aristocratic bon vivant remains almost entirely hearsay. “Quarry,” the elegant black-and-white short accompanying “The Windmill Movie,” is Mr. Rogers’s first film, made in 1967 at a quarry in Quincy, Mass., and released three years later. A portrait of working-class teenagers diving off rocks and chatting while a radio plays the hits of the day, the film is a poignant time capsule of a moment in American life when optimism still reigned. THE WINDMILL MOVIEOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan. Written, directed and edited by Alexander Olch; director of photography, Richard P. Rogers; music by Robert Humphreville and Michael Montes; produced by Susan Meiselas; released by the Film Desk. Shown with Mr. Rogers’s short film “Quarry” at Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village. Running time: 1 hour 22 minutes.

FILM IN REVIEW; 'Seeing Other People' - The New York Times,"Directed by Wally WolodarskyR, 90 minutesJust below the sitcom surface of the smart-talking comedy ''Seeing Other People'' seethes a bitter critique of the sportive sexual habits of Southern California's babes-and- hunks culture. A popular slogan in Aldous Huxley's futuristic satire ''Brave New World'' was the perky assertion ''Everyone belongs to everyone.'' In ''Seeing Other People,'' Alice (Julianne Nicholson) and Ed (Jay Mohr), an attractive, comfortably monogamous couple about to be married, decide to try belonging to everyone as a premarital treat before they settle down. Alice, all fired up after spying on a couple enjoying furtive, quickie sex at her engagement party, persuades her reluctant fiancé that having more notches in their respective belts will fortify their union. Her body count of three lovers simply isn't enough, she insists. No sooner has Ed, a successful comedy writer, given her the green light to play around than she takes up with Donald (Matt Davis), a handsome contractor who becomes obsessed with her, despite having two women on the side. Initially, of course, the mutual titillation of kissing and telling dramatically reheats Ed and Alice's sex life. The movie, which opens today in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Dallas, takes nasty comic pleasure in observing the miserable marriage of Alice's shrewish older sister, Claire (Lauren Graham), and her twit of a husband, Peter (Bryan Cranston). During a sarcastic speech at the engagement party, Claire thanks God that at least she has more money than her sister and humiliates Peter by loudly remarking that his breath is like a sewer. Ed's smoothie of an agent, Lou (Josh Charles), is no angel either. Once Ed gets into the swinger's game, he takes up with Sandy (Jill Ritchie), a crack-smoking, sexually adventurous Harvard graduate who turns out to be much more trouble than he bargained for. Alice becomes seriously jealous and decides that it's time to end the game. But by this time, Ed is not so sure. What does it tell us that the movie's moral grounding wire, Carl (Andy Richter), who lives with the newly divorced Penelope (Helen Slater) and her hellion of a son, is the one younger character who doesn't qualify as a hottie? Plain guys can't play? Carl, one of Ed's best friends, dispenses sage advice, which his friends ignore. In real life, the kind of emotions displayed by the characters are much messier and more volatile than the little spats and hissy fits that erupt in ''Seeing Other People.'' If the movie, directed by Wally Wolodarsky, who wrote the screenplay with his wife, Maya Forbes, glosses over some uncomfortable realities like jealousy, at least it touches on them. There is enough discomfort on display to reinforce the cynical adage that sex is God's joke.''Seeing Other People'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and graphic language. STEPHEN HOLDEN",http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/07/movies/film-in-review-seeing-other-people.html
FILM IN REVIEW; 'Sorority Boys' - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from March 22, 2002, Section E, Page 24Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Directed by Wally WolodarskyR, 94 minutesWally Wolodarsky, the director of ''Sorority Boys,'' made his name -- and quite a name it is -- as a writer for ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' and ''The Simpsons.'' Given this résumé, it pains me to report that Mr. Wolodarsky has made a film that even a rabid lowbrow like Homer Simpson (or, when the mood strikes, this critic) would find beneath his dignity. To be fair, Mr. Wolodarsky did not write the script. Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge did. They are working on a sequel.''Sorority Boys,'' every bit as clever as its title, is a frat-house cross-dressing comedy: ''Some Like it Hot'' and ''Animal House'' slammed together and reworked as a Bazooka Joe comic, but with nudity and swearing, and of no use at all in the disposal of chewed gum. To give you an idea of the humor: the sorority where the nerdy misfit women live is called Delta Omega Gamma, which spells dog. Get it? I can't even tell you the Greek letters in the name of the fraternity. At the beginning of the picture, a frat-house keg party is being picketed by a humorless feminist in glasses (Melissa Sagemiller) who will turn out to be -- get ready! -- a total babe. She is making the inarguable point that the frat brothers make a habit of humiliating, objectifying and degrading women. The three main frat brothers -- Adam (Michael Rosenbaum), Doofer (Harland Williams) and Dave (Barry Watson) -- will learn the error of their ways, but not until they, the audience and the filmmakers have reveled in the humiliation, objectification and degradation of women for 90 minutes. First, the ugly women are trashed, and then, once their inner beauty has been discovered, the pretty women are made into objects of misogynist mockery, but only after we see a bunch of them in really short shorts, in wet T-shirts or topless. But the picture makes fun of guys, too, right? Sure, if you insist. But this sleazy game is rarely played on a level field. Our three heroes, in one of the least convincing feats of cross-dressing ever perpetrated on screen (and if you think back on ''To Wong Foo,'' ''Flawless,'' and ''Bosom Buddies,'' that's saying something), go undercover as DOG pledges. Dave gets involved in some heavy pseudo-lesbian ''Tootsie'' action with Leah, the humorless feminist; Doofer takes a ''Mrs. Doubtfire'' turn cleaning house and offering a motherly shoulder; and Adam does, I don't know, Angie Dickinson in ''Police Woman.'' Rrrrowf. They get into some hilarious stuff: walking in high heels, falling down stairs, worrying about the size of their rear ends. Just like real women, see, except that they're really guys. Oh, man, it's too funny!Sorry. It all leads up to a brutal all-girl (well, almost) football game and a calamitous fraternity-sponsored cocktail cruise, in which the men are shown to be pigs and the women are shown to be men. I wonder what happens in the sequel. On second thought, I don't.''Sorority Boys'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity, nudity and crude sexual humor, and I still wanted to walk out after 10 minutes. A. O. SCOTT",http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/22/movies/film-in-review-sorority-boys.html
FILM REVIEW: VANYA ON 42D STREET; Spare Chekhov Begins Sneakily - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from October 19, 1994, Section C, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The actors and spectators for ""Vanya on 42d Street"" make their entrances casually, drifting into one another at the New Amsterdam Theater and making idle conversation. That chitchat has evolved into Chekhov almost before a movie audience is ready to notice. By the time the viewer fully apprehends the grand, cavernous scale of this crumbling theater or the naturalness of the actors, the performance is under way. This is bare-bones Chekhov, though it is hardly Chekov without cachet. Under the direction of Andre Gregory, this version of ""Uncle Vanya"" (filmed simply yet enthrallingly by Louis Malle) has a significant pedigree. Evolving over a period of years as a workshop production, and available only to small, select audiences, it developed the inevitable mystique, which is only heightened by Mr. Malle's participation. With Wallace Shawn in the title role and memories of ""My Dinner With Andre"" as a quirky, dazzling collaboration by these principals, ""Vanya on 42d Street"" has a lot to live up to. So the lack of fanfare in the film's opening moments amounts to a declaration. This ""Vanya"" is not so colorfully eccentric as ""My Dinner With Andre,"" but it is no less single-minded. It seeks to isolate the very essentials of the play, with an adaptation by David Mamet to expedite the task. Delving the despair of Chekhov's characters in what is actually quite a rarefied creative atmosphere, it incorporates its share of contradictions, in a way that recalls the most desolate Woody Allen films about privileged, luxuriantly introspective characters. On screen, at intimately close range, a similarly refined angst emerges from ""Uncle Vanya.""But the elegant understatement of this production turns it into a livelier experiment, a fluent, gripping version of one of Chekhov's more elusive plays. There is no objective correlative of cherry orchard caliber here, no naturally riveting image that survives when the furniture and scenery are stripped away. Instead, there are only wayward emotions and deep regrets, the raw essentials of a psychodrama that has been coaxed forth here with illusory ease. The actors wear street clothes. The props aren't more than tables, chairs and takeout coffee cups. The intent-looking audience consists only of Mr. Gregory and a few friends. And the absence of obvious artifice is used by Mr. Malle to focus attention entirely on a group of forthright, unmannered actors, with the camera appearing to gaze into their very souls. Exquisitely lighted and well served by the ravaged beauty of this unexpectedly photogenic old theater, ""Vanya on 42d Street"" has a visual elegance that seems to isolate and purify its characters and their troubles.""Uncle Vanya"" is set at a rambling Russian country house, and Mr. Mamet has retained the atmospheric touches, right down to the samovars. But his neat, concise adaptation gives the dialogue a contemporary ring without noticeably departing from the text. (Mamet: ""The people won't remember, but God will."" Chekhov: ""They don't need to remember. God remembers."") The convoluted problems of the household emerge that much more easily thanks to Mr. Mamet's unmannered adaptation. The most peculiar aspect of this production comes with the casting, which reveals an oddly wavering approach to the play. Julianne Moore makes a sleek Yelena, the beautiful wife of a pompous, aging professor (George Gaynes), and a woman who stirs the yearnings of both Vanya, her brother-in-law (Mr. Shawn) and Astrov (Larry Pine), a country doctor with a worldly air. The history of this production goes back to 1989, so that it was Ms. Moore's appearance in ""Uncle Vanya"" that led Robert Altman to cast her memorably in ""Short Cuts.""But Ms. Moore's sly, delicately shaded performance, which is also made extraordinarily photogenic by careful lighting of her red hair, is in a very different key from Mr. Shawn's more comedic Vanya. That character's bitterness and frustration emerge very clearly, but the farcical side of Mr. Shawn is incongruous at times. When he tells Yelena passionately that she has mermaid's blood, he seems almost to be joking. Mr. Gaynes, another actor known for humorous screen roles, is another surprising presence here, though both he and Mr. Shawn perform with obvious conviction. In a more straightforward vein, Mr. Pine plays Astrov with the rakishness of a younger Jason Robards. And Brooke Smith, memorable as that tough kidnapping victim in ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" makes a luminous and heartbreaking Sonya, the lonely young woman who adores Astrov but senses that her destiny is drearier than her aspirations. Also in ""Vanya on 42d Street"" are Phoebe Brand, the venerable teacher and Group Theater actress, as the household's reassuring Nanny; Lynn Cohen as Maman; Jerry Mayer as Waffles, and Madhur Jaffrey as one of the celebrityish guests chatting with Mr. Gregory during occasional breaks in the performance. Declan Quinn's muted, precise cinematography adds one more grace note to an already graceful production.""Vanya on 42d Street"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has mild profanity and a brief scene involving a gun.

Grover is a teen-age nerd, but will he stay nerdy for long? Of course not. He is the hero of ''The Invisible Kid,'' a movie that proves you can cull every known cliche from successful teen adventure films and still come up with a bomb. The story begins with bubbling green slime that is meant to make you say ''yech'' or ''gross'' but looks too plastic for that. When Grover accidentally adds a secret ingredient to this potion, it changes from toilet bowl cleaner to a magic powder that makes people invisible. From that point on, Grover's family, friends and plot all line up in predictable order. His pal has big ideas for invisibility (''Let's at least sneak into the girls' locker room.''). His mom is Karen Black, struggling to be kooky in another of her embarrassing cameos. And the beautiful girl next door (Chynna Phillips, who does resemble her mother, Michelle Phillips) will, of course, dump her basketball star boyfriend for Grover, whose nerdiness vanishes when he tosses away his black-rimmed glasses. (No one really needs glasses in movies.) There are lots of tracking shots, in which the camera moves along empty high-school corridors to show an invisible person's point of view. The potion is constantly wearing off, leaving people in public without their clothes, though the camera never strays to areas that would risk the film's PG rating. There is more, but you get the idea.''The Invisible Kid,'' which opened yesterday at the Criterion Center and other theaters, is especially painful to watch because it is the second film written and directed by Avery Crounse, whose first feature was an uneven but wildly original work called ''Eyes of Fire'' - part ghost story, part 18th-century morality tale. Here Mr. Crounse seems to go out of his way to level down his taste and aim at the mass audience. You can't blame him for trying to go commercial, but you might wish he'd had some flair for it.''The Invisible Kid'' is rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''). There is some nudity.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. THE renowned theater organist Lee Erwin, who enjoyed a 30-year career on radio and television, has devoted himself for the last 19 years to composing, performing and recording organ music to accompany silent-film classics. Mr. Erwin has written brand-new scores for some 70 silent movies, including all the films of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and D. W. Griffith, among others. Six years ago he toured the United States with the ''Silent Clowns'' festival. And on Tuesday evening, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, he performed his score for the 1923 silent-film version of ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' on the cathedral's booming pipe organ, as the movie was shown. A very busy melodrama that features an extraordinarily intense performance by Lon Chaney as Quasimodo, ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' is the sort of movie that traditionally invited live accompanists to underscore its hot-and-heavy doings with music that cartooned the unceasing turbulence. But Mr. Erwin's score, whose rumbling chromatic sonorities at times evoke Poulenc's Organ Concerto, is the furthest thing from the ricky-tick cliches and lachrymose pop-tune accompaniments that one traditionally associates with silent-film music. Instead of following the film's specific actions, Mr. Erwin's score and his lucid performance set a quietly majestic tone, enhancing the movie's power by maintaining a seamless, dignified flow that deliberately contradicted the jumpy rhythms of the film's editing. The music eschewed obvious leitmotifs and catchy tunes to set a spiritual mood inspired by the cathedral setting of many of the scenes. The closest it came to melodrama was in some brief passages that suggested distant cannonade. By taking a very broad view of the story, Mr. Erwin created an atmosphere that was at once solemn and suspenseful, building sustained, unresolved harmonies and keeping the dynamics relatively hushed. How well the score would stand on its own outside of movie context remains to be seen. But at the very least, the performance added dignity and emotional resonance to a musty film classic.",http://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/10/movies/music-lee-erwin-score-for-silent-hunchback.html

Wally, a playwright who takes acting job s when he can get them to make ends meet, is on his way to a posh restaurant to h ave dinner with Andre (Andre Gregory), the innovative theater direc tor (Off Off Broadway's ''Alice in Wonderland'' at his Manhattan Thea ter Project) who was Wally's first mentor. Wally, as he tells us on the soundtrack, is not really looking forward to the evening. He and Andre haven't seen each other in some years and Wally is not sure what he's going to find. He's heard stories about Andre's dropping out, periodically leaving a beloved wife and children to go off to Tibet and such places to talk to trees. He's agreed to dine with Andre only at the urging of a mutual friend who had recently come upon Andre ''in some odd corner of town,'' sobbing uncontrollably, apparently because he had been so moved by the line in Ingmar Bergman's ''Autumn Sonata'' in which a character says, ''I could always live in my art, but never in my life.''Thus begins Louis Malle's very funny, extremely special new film, ''My Dinner with Andre,'' which will be shown at Alice Tully Hall at the New York Film Festival today at 9:30 P. M. and on Saturday at 6 P. M. It will open its regular commercial engagement at the Baronet Theater on Sunday.''My Dinner with Andre'' is just that, nearly two hours of talk about theater, art, life, electric blankets and Western Civilization, over dinner, during which Andre rattles on at enthusiastic length about his search for himself in the forests of Poland, the dunes of the Sahara, the heaths of Scotland, the mountains of India and on the estate of Richard Avedon on Long Island. Wally asks questions and registers his amazement with ''wows'' and ''goshes'' and ''Gods.''Andre is morose as he explains why he temporarily gave up the theater. His theatrical experiments were either self-defeating or impossible, as when he once suggested that the actress playing Agawe in his production of ''The Bacchae'' at Yale carry around a real severed head secured from the New Haven morgue. The actress flatly refused. The talk is not exactly Shavian but it's sometimes so provocative or nutty or free-wheeling that one would like to butt in. Andre has been obsessed with getting in touch with original feelings. People are robots, he's convinced, reacting in expected ways to expected situations. Everyone is on automatic pilot. Everybody responds only to what he wants. The forest, except in Jerzy Grotowski's Poland, is not to be seen for the trees. Andre at first seems to be an impossibly, self-centered kook. He speaks in the latest jargon and for all the pain he talks about feeling, he's dressed in the most fashionably casual way. Money clearly is no problem. As the dinner progresses, though, he becomes a most winning character, and I use the word character advisedly. For although Andre Gregory is playing Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn is playing Wally Shawn, ''My Dinner with Andre,'' put together from hundreds of hours of tapes of conversations between Mr. Shawn and Mr. Gregory, is fiction and the characters, modeled on their real selves, are fictitious characters. It's the achievement of Mr. Malle, the director of ''Atlantic City,'' ''Pretty Baby'' and a lot of other very fine, conventional movies, that he has successfully turned his two real-life personalities into actors capable of representing themselves. That's not easy. It must be added, however, that not all of the talk is so fascinating that one's interest doesn't flag. It might be better if it were a conversation heard at the next table, one on which one could tune in and out at will. At times ''My Dinner with Andre'' suggests a reunion of Christopher Robin (Mr. Gregory) and Winnie-the-Pooh (Mr. Shawn) 30 years after each has left the nursery to pursue separate careers in the theater. Mr. Gregory, older, originally more practical, has sought truth in ways that must strike a lot of us, including Mr. Shawn, as crazily if wonderfully self-indulgent. Mr. Shawn's Pooh, however, is just what you might think Pooh would grow up to be - still filled with wonder and curiosity about mundane things, capable of finding joy in daily tasks of utmost banali ty, thinking that a trip to the top of Everest to find oneself is somewhat expe nsive when he, Pooh, is convinced he might find himself quite as easi ly in the cigar store next door. Wally, like Pooh, is also candid e nough to say at one point, with polite exasperation, ''Ireally don't know what you're talking about.''And that, possibly, is the reason that this film is often so invigorating, and why these two men respond to each other so well. Wally's practical ordinariness as a man, the mild-mannered fellow who lies within the ''raging beast'' he seems to be as a playwright, is a perfect sounding board for the restless Andre. As Andre sees himself more clearly through Wally's self-awareness, Wally must examine his own delight in, say, a home-cooked meal with his friend Debby (on one of the nights when Debby isn't working as a waitress to support the two of them), through Andre's sometimes hilarious adventures in selfexpression, here and abroad.''My Dinner with Andre'' is not a conventio nal movie, but it is a movie. However, I wouldn't advise anyone to s ee it after a satisfyingly big dinner. It's easier to watch other people eat, and to listen to other people talk, when one is hungry.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. As the title suggests, most of the action in ""Red Stallion in the Rockies"" takes place in the great outdoor wilderness. Good thing, too. Every time the new film at the Palace goes indoors to explore the sad heart of its heroine and her yearning for a handsome circus trick rider temporarily marking time on a ranch, the going becomes rather tedious. However, the director keeps the script pretty much in the background, bringing it out only when necessary to bridge a gap in the rompings of a pack of wild horses. The big red stallion does plenty of prancing and, wouldn't you know it, turns out to be the famous circus performer which everybody thought had perished in a fire some time back. The scenes of the horses charging over the fields and mountains, breaking into ranches to free other animals and generally cavorting and snorting in the Cinecolored night are pleasant enough. ""Red Stallion in the Rockies"" would make acceptable fare for the kiddies, except, possibly for a climactic battle between the stallion and an enraged elk which turns out to be quite a gory affair. Arthur Franz, Jean Heather, Wallace Ford, Ray Collins and James Davis are among the actors who fail to do anything especially noteworthy in this cinematic run-of-the-farm accompaniment to the Palace's vaudeville program.

"' T-Men,' Story of Job Done by Treasury Department Agents, Is New Bill at Criterion - The New York Times","assuming, that is, that the business is as rough as it looks on Loew's Criterion screen. And there are also quicker ways of being wearied than by sitting through Edward Small's ""T-Men."" For, according to this tough-guy thriller, which slammed into that theatre yesterday, these law enforcement agents for the Treasury really lead deteriorating lives, full of peril from violent mobsters and grief from their own likely slips. And, for those of a slightly sensitive nature, the appearance of this danger on the screen is likely to stir anxieties to an almost unendurable point. Hand it to Mr. Small's craftsmen: they have turned out a cops-and-robbers film in this new ""semi-documentary"" format which, for action, is one of the best. Presented as a fictional recreation of a typical Treasury Department case and introduced by Elmer L. Irey, former head of its law enforcement agencies, it tells how a couple of T-men, disguising themselves as thugs, perilously worm their way into and expose a huge counterfeit ring. And it also gives some indication of scientific crime-detection tricks employed. Made in part on locations in Detroit and Los Angeles, it does have a look of reality not often encountered in such films. And it is played by a cast of actors who handle themselves credibly. Except for a few familiar figures—Dennis O'Keefe as the key T-man, Wally Ford as an underworld schemer and Art Smith as a Treasury Department chief—most of the performers have faces which are fresh and convincingly right. Alfred Ryder as a finally murdered T-man and John Wengraf as an urbane crook are best. And Anthony Mann has directed the action, of which there is more than enough, with a fine sense of melodramatic timing and a good eye for sharp, severe effects. But, of course, it must be acknowledged that the pattern is fairly well worn and that there isn't a great deal of difference between a T-man and a G-man—on the screen. Furthermore, an inquisitive Y-man [which is what this reviewer is] might question some of the action and devices as plausible. Also—and this is the main point—if T-men do actually take such picturesque physical beatings as Mr. O'Keefe takes here, we wonder that any bright fellows could possibly be recruited for the jobs.

"' The Mighty McGurk,' Typical Wallace Beery Fare Offered by Metro, at the Loew's State -- Dean Stocktoell Is in Cast - The New York Times","even his studio handlers—can remember. ""The Mighty McGurk,"" which arrived at Loew's State yesterday, is no deviation from the norm. And Mr. Beery is no mutation of the sturdy citizen the customers have been appraising these many years. But while this story of an ex-prizefight champ who befriends an English orphan boy fits our pug as comfortably as an old shoe, it doesn't look much better than an ancient brogan. Mr. Beery, in short, has fought this good fight before and chances are the going will be as familiar and slow for the customers as it seems to be for our hero. Although it is billed as an original yarn; this adventure, strangely enough, strongly brings to mind, ""The Champ,"" another Beery vehicle of fond memory. In this instance Mr. Beery is not only involuntarily involved with an admiring ward, but is also being blackmailed by a Bowery saloonkeeper, whom he serves as flunky and bouncer. The turn-of-the-century scene also finds Mr. Beery tangled in such sundry matters as an unrequited love affair between the saloonkeeper's daughter and a Salvation Army officer, the Children's Protective League, bistro brawls and with a vituperative sparring partner in Aline MacMahon. Unsurprisingly and after a surprising amount of talk things are straightened out with our hero sheepishly plighting his troth to Miss MacMahon. Dean Stockwell, remembered for his touching portrayal in ""The Green Years,"" is commendable as the wistful, immigrant tyke who attaches himself to the braggart bouncer. Edward Arnold, as the shady tavern keeper; Aline MacMahon, as Beery's middle-aged and ever-loving, pawnbroker girl friend, and Dorothy Patrick and Cameron Mitchell, as the romantic leads, round out an adequate supporting cast. On the stage at the State are Mickey Rooney, Estellita, Will Mastin Trio, Sid Gould, Abigail and Buddy and The Marvelettes. THE MIGHTY McGURK, original screen play by William R.

"THE SCREEN; 'My Reputation,' With Barbara Stanwyck and George Brent, Opens at Strand--'Pillow of Death' New Bill at the Rialto - The New York Times","or practically nothing, we'd say. For this earnest dramatic disquisition on the great value of a good name, after making elaborate clawing gestures at the hearts of the cusmers for more than an hour, arrives at an easy conclusion which makes the whole preceding turmoil seem absurd—that is, if you haven't already perceived for yourself that it is. It tells of a lovely young widow, mother of two 'teen-age sons and apparently quite an adornment of Chicago's Lake Forest set, who meets an Army major and finds him agreeable company. The friendship is innocent, mind you—indeed, it looked downright dull to us—but it stirs up some ugly rumors which eventually reach the two sons. They leave home and go to Granny's, whither mama follows them and explains that she really loves the major, which settles everything. In the final scene mama and the major get themselves betrothed. Dismissing completely the aspects of egocentrism in this yarn—that is to say, mama's unhealthy absorption in herself—the mere demonstration of behavior and social conventions herein is so thoroughly stilted and stuffy that the whole thing lacks common sense. As the beautiful widow-lady, Barbara Stanwyck tries hard to act real, but the script seems to make her uncomfortable, except in a tight sweater in one scene. George Brent plays the role of the major with a strong list to juvenility, especially in those passages wherein he is supposed to make wolfish love. Mr. Brent, for your information, is about as urbane as a high-school sophomore. John Ridgely, Eve Arden, Jerome Cowan and Leona Maricle play younger married folk with decided nods to Scott Fitzgerald, and Lucille Watson plays Granny solemnly. It's a good thing that no one's reputation is dependent upon this film—and that goes, too, for Curtis Bernhardt, who directed it, thanklessly.

THE SCREEN; At the Globe - The New York Times,"and in Technicolor, too. Many a model set has been demolished, many an extra smeared with scarlet, and many a Japanese blown sky-high before this extravagant yarn is over. Mr. Beery's language, now that the lid is off, is hardly less colorful—""little yellow mustard-colored monkeys"" is merely one of his several definitions of our Pacific enemy. Briefly, it is a story tailored to Mr. Beery's familiar dimensions. An overgrown bad boy with a gilt-edged heart and a coy way of confessing' his numerous sins, Mr. Beery is a bellows-lunged marine sergeant who never won a citation though he would dearly love one. He is a service chauvinist to the core; when anyone so much as breathes a word against the Marines he polishes them off even if its costs him the brig. Finally retired, amid the pacifist inhabitants of the Philippine settlement, the old sergeant calls all the shots on the Japanese game of duplicity and is finally vindicated when the Zeros come. Hollywood hindsight makes unconvincing foresight in the movies. But at any rate, Mr. Beery and some stout Filipinos fight their roaring battle and Mr. Beery, at least, wins. It is all Rover Boy drama in the bellowing, homespun fashion that has come to be associated with Mr. Beery, and there are many who like it. But displays of patriotism; no less than acting, can be guilty of the same cheaply theatrical excesses that, in the theatre, are defined as ""ham."" Mr. Beery's ""Salute to the Marines"" has many a hectic, as well as embarrassing moment, but he is still fighting a small boy's war.

Autre temps, autres moeurs, as the French are wont to say. It has taken a national crisis to blow the hayseed out of Wallace Beery's hair and make him a modern soldier in Uncle Sam's armored force. Yes, that is the wondrous task accomplished in Metro's ""The Bugle Sounds,"" which came, in a burst of Old Glory, to the Capitol yesterday. Yet the job is not done without effort and a certain amount of pain. Old Wally, as an ancient cavalry sergeant, holds out against progress bitterly. He bids a last farewell to his old charger in a characteristic drizzle of tears. And he takes to the ""mikeinized"" army with gruff acerbity. But with Colonel Lewis Stone as his sponsor and sympathetic guide he not only makes a great soldier but he nabs a gang of saboteurs to boot. Wally is in the army. Let the enemy beware. As another bit of motion-picture dreaming about our military services, ""The Bugle Sounds"" has, at least, the virtue of being wholly unglamorous. Mr. Beery never has been trumped up as a particularly graceful star, and neither has Marjorie Main, who plays his casual off-post sweetheart in this film. So the flavor is strictly earthy. It is true to the Army in that. And a lot of very interesting footage showing tanks and motorized troops has been cut in. But the story is, again, one of those wild things which makes for situations more than sense, and Mr. Beery is simply given a vehicle in which to run through his familiar routines. Incidentally, there seems to be some confusion among the participants as to how things stand. Sometimes they talk of ""preparedness"" and at other times it's ""now we're in a war."" Maybe the declaration came while Mr. Beery was on that five-day bat. THE BUGLE SOUNDS, screen play by Cyril Hume; based on a story by Lawrence Kimble and Mr. Hume; directed by S.

FILM REVIEW;3 Paul Bowles Stories And a Hint of Hitchcock - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from January 17, 1996, Section C, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Coolly enigmatic, with hooded eyes, a patrician accent and an air of unbreachable hauteur, the author Paul Bowles suggests a highbrow Alfred Hitchcock in his introductions to the film adaptations of three of his short stories in the movie ""Halfmoon"" at the Film Forum. This aura of sly knowingness with a hint of menace goes to the heart of the stories that Frider Schlaich and Irene von Alberti, who wrote and produced ""Halfmoon,"" have filmed with a remarkably acute sensitivity to landscape and atmosphere. ""Merkala Beach,"" ""Call at Corazon"" and ""Allal"" are all tales of temptation, treachery and revenge in which a heated sidelong glance conveys more truth than the characters' charged but elliptical dialogue. Merkala Beach"" examines the friendship of two shiftless young Moroccan men, one a drinker, the other a smoker of kef. Their edgy relationship is tested when a seductive young woman (Sondos Belhassen) gives herself first to one, then to the other. Mr. Bowles, filmed at his home in Tangiers, introduces the tale by explaining he is trying to show ""the superior effects of smoking cannabis over those of alcohol."" But the vicious little story is much more. It is a cold-eyed look at a kind of primitive male camaraderie in which every friendly gesture is also a move in a game whose inevitable outcome is an eruption of violence.""Call at Corazon"" depicts the hellish honeymoon of a mismatched British couple sailing up the Amazon on an overcrowded, pest-ridden cargo boat. The husband (Sam Cox), a taciturn writer who bitterly proclaims that ""woman requires strict ritualistic observance of the traditions of sexual behavior,"" intimidates his wife (Veronica Quilligan) by buying a monkey and installing it in their cabin. She retaliates by getting drunk. As they head into the steamy jungle, their war of attrition escalates into the cruelest possible acts of revenge and counterrevenge. In the third story, the ominous mood of the first two tales assumes a supernatural dimension. Allal, a solitary Moroccan boy (Said Zakir) who has grown up a pariah in his desert village because he is illegitimate, befriends an itinerant old man (Mohammed Belfquih) selling poisonous snakes. While sheltering the snake dealer for a night in his desert hovel, Allal steals one of his cobras. In a firelight ritual in which he charms the snake into winding itself around his body, he merges identities with it. Embellished with surreal touches that show the snake scales sliding across the boy's eyes while he sleeps, ""Allal"" is as spellbinding as it is creepy. In Mr. Zakir's blood-chilling portrayal, the boy is a glittering-eyed desert creature, a wild child who may speak human language but lives the feral, instinctual life of a reptile. Together the three stories capture the essence of Mr. Bowles's vision of human cruelty as a driving life force indivisible from the harsh equatorial landscapes in which his characters find themselves. With a parched sexuality that is secretive and fraught with violence, these people scent each other like vigilant wild beasts waiting for just the right moment to pounce. As scary as they may be, they are also thoroughly recognizable.

"FILM REVIEW;That's Agent 007? No, It Must Be 000 - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from May 24, 1996, Section C, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. When Agent WD-40 (Leslie Nielsen), a k a Dick Steele, receives an assignment on a tape programmed to self-destruct within three seconds, it doesn't extinguish itself in a discreet little fizzle but sets off a thunderous blast that blows up the helicopter in which Mr. T is piloting him to a top-secret operation. So begins ""Spy Hard,"" the anything-goes spoof of espionage movies that arrives just in time to cleanse the palate from the pseudo-serious action-adventure of ""Mission Impossible.""This promising opening sequence may tip its cap to ""Mission Impossible,"" but the main objects of parody are James Bond movies with their slithery babes, fantastic weapons and exotic tropical settings. ""Spy Hard"" is never funnier than during its opening credit sequence in which Weird Al Yankovic bellows his parody of the brassy theme song from ""Goldfinger,"" while obese cartoon silhouettes swim across the screen. Mr. Nielsen, who plays a silver-haired American version of Roger Moore as Bond, brings the same spirit of deadpan comic earnestness to the role that he brought to his intrepid police lieutenant in the ""Naked Gun"" series. Mr. Nielsen may lose his pants in a movie, but he never loses his dignity. He embodies an unflappable masculine gentility that conceals utter fatuousness and ineptitude. Even in the silliest pratfall, Mr. Nielsen allows just the tiniest glimmer of merriment to twinkle around the edges of his stalwart, purposeful glare.""Spy Hard,"" directed by Rick Friedberg, who collaborated with Mr. Nielsen on a comic instructional video on how to lose at golf, is a much less polished film than the ""Naked Gun"" movies. Instead of building sustained comic set pieces, it takes a machine-gun approach to humor. Without looking at where it's aiming, it opens fire and sprays comic bullets in all directions, trusting that a few will hit the bull's-eye. A few do, but many more don't. The problem facing a movie like ""Spy Hard"" is how to make caricatures out of heroes and villains who were cartoons to begin with. Some of the movie's funnier moments are spent imagining that the director of United States Intelligence (Charles Durning) is so nutty he likes to play hide-and-seek with his colleagues by secreting himself in his office furniture. One afternoon, when WD-40 plops down on a brown leather chair, strange sounds begin erupting from below. The agent's fiendish nemesis, General Rancor (Andy Griffith, made up to look a little like Stalin), lures WD-40 to his tropical-island lair by holding hostage Barbara Dahl (Stephanie Romanov), the beautiful secret-agent daughter of WD-40's long-lost sweetheart. Along the way, he teams up with Veronique Ukrinsky (Nicollette Sheridan), a mysterious international spy with an all-purpose European accent. During their big love scene, he woos her with a ludicrous romantic soliloquy that begins with raindrops and dewdrops and ends with dog and deer droppings. Around the halfway point, ""Spy Hard"" begins to run out of ideas and becomes a series of crude, rambunctious parodies of other films. Poking fun at ""Speed,"" it has WD-40 finding himself on a runaway city bus driven by Ray Charles. Echoing ""True Lies,"" the film follows him as he gallops on horseback into a hotel where the horse lands flailing in a swimming pool. ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Sister Act,"" ""Home Alone"" and, of all things, the bicycle scene from ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" also come in for some ribbing. The low point comes when two hoods intimidate a tow-headed Macaulay Culkin-like boy genius and shout: ""This is for 'Getting Even With Dad!' ""This is for 'My Girl!' This is for 'My Girl 2!' ""When ""Spy Hard"" abruptly ends after only 81 minutes, you sense that it has used up every last round of available ammunition. It was simply exhausted and couldn't move another inch.""Spy Hard"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mildly sexual scenes and off-color jokes.

Of Streets Paved With Sadness - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from May 14, 1997, Section C, Page 16Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. With only a few dollars in his pocket, Amir (Pavan Malhotra), an illegal Pakistani immigrant arrives in London huddled in a vegetable crate. Rushed to the north of England in a van, he finds himself crammed into a dingy brick house with 17 other Pakistani ''illegals,'' all cowering in fear lest they be discovered and deported. Amir's first job is shoveling sheep manure in a wool-washing mill. Once a week, when a prostitute visits the house, the men line up for her services in the order of their seniority. When his turn comes, the gentle Amir is ridiculously courtly, kissing her hands and calling her his ''little nightingale'' while she impatiently waits for him to get on with it. These opening scenes from ''Brothers in Trouble'' portray the experience of first-generation immigrants from the Indian subcontinent into Britain in the early 1960's as a kind of Dickensian nightmare. Expecting well-paying jobs that will enable them to send money home and eventually rejoin their families, they find themselves ruthlessly exploited and regimented like slaves.''Brothers in Trouble,'' which opens today at the Film Forum, explores the fragile solidarity among these oppressed, homesick expatriates and the tensions among them that explode when a woman comes to live in the dreary all-male enclave. At first, Mary (Angeline Ball), a free-spirited young Irish woman brought home by the stern house leader Hussein Shah (the noted Indian actor Om Puri), appears to be a glamorously exotic addition to the tiny community. The star-struck immigrants view her as a jewel sent from heaven to bring a little dazzle into their lives. Things begin to sour when Mary has a baby that is obviously not Shah's. Humiliated, Shah coerces her into marrying his nephew, Irshad (Ahsen Bhatti), so the young man can enter Britain legally. But when Irshad, arrogant in his newfound security, begins courting Mary right under his uncle's nose (and Mary responds), their sexual competition explodes into violence. Further complicating matters is the mad infatuation of Amir's emotionally unstable best friend, Sakib (Pravesh Kumar), an aspiring writer, who fantasizes that the heedlessly flirtatious Mary is in love with him.''Brothers in Trouble,'' directed by Udayan Prasad from a screenplay by Robert Buckler, does a fine job of capturing the fearful, claustrophobic atmosphere of a house where any knock on the door could spell disaster. The movie's collective portrait of the immigrants is of a group of strait-laced family men who are so oppressed in their new life that they are emotionally reduced to children with virtually no outlet for their bottled-up feelings. Only once a week when they visit a theater that shows Indian movies during the day do they break out of their fearful trances, erupting with raucous, hysterical relief. For all its ashcan realism, ''Brothers in Arms'' has its uplifting side. A postscript suggests that for at least one character, patience, perseverance and self-sacrifice pay off, and the chilly landscape of northern England in which wildflowers poke through the grime begins to feel like home. BROTHERS IN TROUBLEDirected by Udayan Prasad; written by Robert Buckler, based on an Urdu novel ''The Return Journey,'' by Abdullah Hussein; director of photography, Alan Almond; edited by Barrie Vince; music by Stephen Warbeck; production designer, Chris Townsend; produced by Mr. Buckler; released by First Run Features.

"Review: ‘Careful What You Wish For,’ Starring Nick Jonas as a Naïve Teenage Lover - The New York Times","Nick Jonas, who is 23, made a convincing college student in the television series “Scream Queens” last season, but he makes an exceedingly unconvincing high school student in the wretched “Careful What You Wish For,” a film that tries to be both titillating and suspenseful but is neither. He plays Doug, who settles in for a summer on the lake with his parents and stumbles into a teenage boy’s fantasy: The gorgeous married woman next door, Lena (Isabel Lucas), relieves him of his virginity. Doug is too naïve to entertain the possibility that she is merely using him to escape her abusive, heavy-drinking husband (Dermot Mulroney). That possibility becomes a dark reality when the husband turns up dead, and poor Doug is soon thoroughly tangled in a web of deceit. The film, written by Chris Frisina and directed by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum, is trying for steamy but more often achieves laughable, thanks to numbing dialogue, especially for Ms. Lucas. (“Right now,” she heavy-breathes, dragging him off for a quickie in an inappropriate location. “I can’t wait.”) The movie, with its naughty forbidden-desires story line, seems pitched to the sexy imaginings of teeny-boppers who were fans of the Jonas Brothers, Mr. Jonas’s boy band, almost a decade ago. But those fans have all grown up now and certainly wouldn’t find this comparatively tame, completely predictable movie to be sultry. “Careful What You Wish For” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexy talk and some beer drinking.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/movies/review-careful-what-you-wish-for-starring-nick-jonas-as-a-naive-teenage-lover.html

It's a subject the character ought to know well. For like everyone else in ""Careful,"" he lives in Tolzbad, an Alpine community of apple-cheeked villagers whose scrubbed faces belie a Freudian wasp's nest of incestuous desire and sibling rivalry. Life in Tolzbad is so precarious, Herr Trotta cautions, that even the cries of wild geese could unleash a snowy apocalypse.""Careful"" is the third full-length movie by Mr. Maddin, an eccentric Canadian film maker who achieved cult status with his two earlier films, ""Archangel"" and ""Tales From the Gimli Hospital."" Both were tongue-in-cheek spoofs of early talkies that caught the look and sound of a bygone era while telling virtually impenetrable stories. Although ""Careful,"" showing at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall at 6:45 tonight and at 9 P. M. on Sunday, shares some of those films' obsessions, it is by far Mr. Maddin's most polished and coherent work. From its portentous between-scenes titles to the way the director bathes whole scenes in garish oranges and blues, ""Careful"" is one long and amusing pun on German Expressionistic film imagery, Freudian psychology and quasi-Wagnerian storytelling, all carried to absurdist lengths. The plot concentrates on a star-crossed family of four. Zenaida (Gosia Dobrowolska), the beautiful widow of an oafish swan feeder, tends a home she shares her three sons, Johann (Brent Neale), Grigorss (Kyle McCulloch) and Franz (Vince Rimmer). While Johann and Grigorss are model sons who attend the same training school for butlers, Franz, who reminds Zenaida of her hated dead husband, is kept prisoner in the attic. Now and then, her husband's blind ghost (Michael O'Sullivan) appears to urge Franz to take action. The family's orderly little world begins to crumble when Johann, who has just become engaged to Klara (Sarah Neville), one of Herr Trotta's two daughters, has an incestuous dream about his mother. Suddenly mad with forbidden passion, he drugs his mother, slits open her bodice and places his lips on her breast. Then in a paroxysm of guilt, he sears his mouth with hot coals, cuts off several fingers and leaps off a precipice. That's just the beginning of the sexual Sturm und Drang that rises in the characters like an avalanche from within. The screenplay by Mr. Maddin and George Toles, who thought up the story, is filled with stilted speeches about duty, honor, virtue, shame and toilet training. Proclamations of love are written in bright purple. ""Your eyes are so blue,"" Johann declares to his fiancee. ""You're as fresh and sound as a rose."" This all builds to a ludicrous snow-filled Liebestod that rings with stilted oratory. The movie's biggest strength is its knowing burlesques of antiquated cinematic techniques. Although ""Careful"" hardly tries to look exactly like an old movie, it uses the visual textures and rhythms of old-time movie making to caricature a particular cultural mindset. The film's biggest weakness is its acting. Most of the players, including Mr. McCulloch, the director's regular leading man, go about their chores with an amateurish enthusiasm that gives the movie a homemade quality. If the central performances in ""Careful"" approached the earnest intensity of some of its early-1930's inspirations, the movie would probably be twice as funny.

At the Rialto - The New York Times,"till halted yesterday by threat of Injunction from the Hays office—insisted on billing Paramount's ""Lady, Be Careful"" under the title ""Sailor, Beware,"" which, as you may recall, was the came of the original stage play. The Hays office, of course, was right; the picture is no more ""Sailor, Beware"" than it is ""Little Women"" or ""Anne of Green Gables."" Its plot has a certain haunting familiarity, though, like an old favorite shirt which is finally returned after being laundered almost beyond recognition. That superbly efficient wet-wash technique of the Hollywood laundries, which consists half the time in removing not only the dirt but the shirt as well, has been applied in the case of ""Lady, Be Careful"" by some of the most highly paid spot removers on the Paramount staff. Dorothy Parker, a gifted washerwoman, who was evidently called in on the Chaucerian theory that no one makes a better game warden than a reformed poacher; her husband, Alan Campbell, and a literary consultant named Harry Ruskin have done such a thorough job of scrubbing that if the play-wrights hadn't luckily sold their idea to Hollywood long ago they couldn't recover a penny by suing the screen authors for plagiarism. It is true that the legendary virtue of Miss Billie (Stonewall) Jackson of Clancy's Casino, Panama City, is still the pivot of the plot, with the somehow extremely improbable Mary Carlisle as the lady on whose caprices the whole United States Navy and Marine Corps, apparently, have concluded an amusing wager. But Dynamite (Lew Ayres), the male end of the bet, has been turned into a moon-calf with all-too-serious intentions. Early scenes, more bogus than musical comedy, have been inserted to lend color to his trumped-up reputation as a lady-killer, and the dialogue has been changed from pungent, spicy, authentic navy to something inexcusable, and with scarcely a saving ounce of the Parker vitriol to justify the change. On the whole, the Hays office was right in banning the original title. Since it had already banned the play, it was in all fairness to the Messrs. Nicholson and Robinson, the only honorable thing to do.

It was directed, photographed and edited by John O'Brien, a 29-year-old Harvard graduate and film maker who runs his family's sheep farm near Tunbridge, Vt. Though Mr. O'Brien is also responsible for the story, the screenplay was reportedly improvised by the nonprofessional actors, mainly by George Thrush, an architect, and Marya Cohn, who is studying to become a film maker herself. The film will be shown in the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art today at 6 P. M. and Sunday at 3 P. M. Mr. Thrush and Ms. Cohn appear as a couple from the big city who come to Vermont to be married on the farm of her aunt. When they get cold feet, each sets out to ask people in the neighborhood what they think about marriage, and whatever else that pops into the conversation. Most of the movie is made of the responses, none of which is memorably funny, wise, silly or provocative. Mr. O'Brien's search for ""found"" material goes unrewarded. Mr. Thrush and Ms. Cohn may be good company in real life, but when improvising on film, they aren't. At best she seems game and a good sport. He is slightly overbearing without redeeming humor. Both are self-conscious. The Vermonters they talk to are decent, unspectacular folk who resolutely refuse to become colorful. Even at 88 minutes the movie seems very long. The scenery is pretty, full of rolling farm land, covered bridges and two-lane roads. When the interviews run down, Mr. O'Brien cuts to shots of animals, often sheep. Vermont may be for lovers, but it seems to have wall-to-wall sheep. Two good shorts share the bill with the feature. Mike Mitchell's ""Frannie's Christmas"" is a four-minute animated film about a little girl who becomes outraged when she learns there is no Santa Claus. With her even smaller brother, she pieces together her own Santa, following the methods of good old Dr. Frankenstein with more or less the same bizarre results. K. D. Davis's ""Over the Hedge"" is a very funny, brisk (10 minute) documentary about topiary enthusiasts, people who express themselves through the shapes in which they prune their bushes. The unbilled star of the film is an elderly fellow, something of a recluse, who devotes himself to his front lawn, its topiary and the plaster statues with which it's furnished. The lawn is much friendlier than he is, which is the way he planned it.

FILM REVIEW; Courtroom Confrontation With Lots of Star Power - The New York Times,"Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman have never shared the screen before, as they do in ''Runaway Jury,'' the latest film adaptation of a paranoiac John Grisham courtroom potboiler. Yet something feels familiar about the picture -- Mr. Hackman has played this grubby-souled, hand-tailored heart of modern corruption before, and in a previous Grisham adaptation: ''The Firm'' (1993). This time he's a slick jury consultant named Rankin Fitch -- apparently Lex Luthor was already taken -- who employs ruthless, pre-Miranda tactics generally seen on the Fox News channel to empanel a jury favorable to his client. In this case, the client is a weapons manufacturer being sued by the family of a casualty of gun violence, and Fitch is so gung-ho in accomplishing his task that he treats the defense lawyer, Cable (Bruce Davison), like a batboy. In Mr. Grisham's novel, the corporate villain was a tobacco company, a bad guy already pilloried in ''The Insider.'' The producers must have realized that by the time ''Jury'' hit home video, Americans might not even be allowed to smoke in their own imaginations anymore. As in ''The Firm,'' the schematic crassness of the narrative provides a group of actors with the opportunity to deliver some fine work. John Cusack gives one of his wiliest performances in some time, and one of his most mature, as Nick Easter, an aging slacker drafted into jury duty. He subverts his protracted-adolescent cheekiness and pours the melted charm into something far bleaker. Apparently the writers realize there is not much to be done with the boilerplate narrative, which involves the machinations of the jury that Fitch is laboring to bend to his will. Instead they resolve to work around the bullying morality play -- which, unfortunately, can't be done often enough. Case in point: Fitch's nemesis is the endearing Wendall Rohr (Mr. Hoffman), lawyer for the plaintiff. (Rohr has been beefed up from his sideline-size role in the book, and Mr. Hoffman splashes the role with pan gravy.) When Rohr notes that Southern jurors don't trust well-dressed men and makes an ostentatiously tacky choice in necktie, the only logical -- and lazy -- follow-up is Fitch's arrival in a suit made of wool so fresh it still drips lanolin. It soon becomes evident that Fitch is not the only person trying to manipulate the jury into rendering an advantageous verdict. Readers of the novel, and there seem to have been several hundred thousand of them, know exactly where the skeletons are buried. And those who didn't read the book will get to see most of the performers, excluding Mr. Hackman and Mr. Hoffman, encouraged to demonstrate their strengths and have fun with the material. Mr. Cusack wrings contradictions out of his genial, buffoonish persona that show an actor's canniness at work -- he earns the dark circles under his eyes as he observes his fellow jurors. Nora Dunn gleams as an upstanding and unsteady juror. The British actress Rachel Weisz, as the mysterious Marlee, uses her American accent almost as a kind of put-on -- this time, the point of it is to make us unsure. And the cantankerous Bruce McGill barks like an arthritic junkyard dog; he's the flinty judge, getting away with murder so often while reminding the legal teams who run the courtroom that he might be brought up on charges. Still, you may end up wishing that the actors had found a less needlessly show-offy picture to practice their craft. Especially since half the time they're filmed as if they were in the way of the director, Gary Fleder. Mr. Fleder tries to boldface his assets, though in doing so he undermines the picture. He stages ''Jury,'' which opens nationwide today, as if it were an episode of ''C. S. I.''The cameras cruise the Mephistophelean Fitch, tilted up toward his hollow magnificence and anointing him the Prince of Darkness, lording it over a techno-intense war room that seems to be from a Jerry Bruckheimer version of ''The Sting.'' With his pointy beard and cunning squint to emphasize his perfidy, Fitch is missing only a cloven hoof and a trail of smoke when he enters a room. Mr. Fleder's stylized technique does function well when he sets up the story, creating a crime-novel sense of dread out of the horrible event that leads to the lawsuit. Perhaps his impulse to overdo things springs from an instinctive rejection of the corniness of Mr. Grisham's conceit, with its tired morality. But the director doesn't inject superfluous flourishes in the one instance in which it might have been called for -- the scene between Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Hackman, in which their respect for each other's prowess keeps them restrained. They're too polite to strike sparks in a picture so full of pyrotechnics it could be charged with arson.''Runaway Jury'' might have been better served if the casting was reversed, and Mr. Hoffman's small stature and busy methods were contrasted with Mr. Hackman's gift for playing weary reason.''Runaway Jury'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has grandiose strong language, unnecessary cliffhanger violence and alcohol and drug consumption.

FILM REVIEW; Serious Identity Crisis: Good Guy or Robot Alien Suicide Bomber? - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from January 4, 2002, Section E, Page 33Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. At the beginning of ''Impostor,'' a title informs us that the movie is based on a short story by the science-fiction writer and ''legendary futurist'' Philip K. Dick. There is a pause, and then more text appears saying the story was written in 1953. The significance of the date is ambiguous in the context of Gary Fleder's breathless dystopian thriller. The movie is either alerting us to the uncanny prescience of its source or apologizing in advance for its dated view of the world that awaits us. Like other forms of prognostication -- tarot card reading, say, or Sunday morning talking-heads punditry -- sci-fi works best when it is vague and flexible. In 2079, according to ''Impostor,'' Earth is locked in an endless war with a ruthless enemy. In addition to death and destruction on a vast scale, the war has led to a totalitarian world government, the degradation of the environment and the construction of electromagnetic missile shields over cities. Citizens are monitored through ID chips implanted in their spines, and public money is mainly spent on weapons research. (The fashion industry seems to have suffered the usual futuristic extinction. In 2079 black will not just be the new black; it will be the only black.) There is paranoia here to suit every taste and era -- cold war or post-, liberal or libertarian -- and for the first few minutes at least, as the particulars are spelled out, you may feel a tremor of plausible dread. Not to worry. The movie quickly settles into soothingly familiar territory. The hero is Olham (Gary Sinise), a military scientist whose grim work is leavened by his happy marriage to a lovely doctor (Madeleine Stowe). Unless, that is, Olham is not Olham at all, but a Centaurian replicant who has infiltrated Earth and been programmed to detonate himself at a meeting with the head of the world government. This, at any rate, is the theory held by Hathaway (Vincent D'Onofrio), a world-government detective who sweeps through the picture in a black trench coat, barking sarcastically at his legions of underlings. Since there are a limited number of turns the plot can take -- Olham will turn out to be either who he thinks he is or what Hathaway thinks he is -- the movie fills the allotted time before solving the mystery by following Hathaway's pursuit of his quarry. Movie police work seems not to have improved much by 2079: once the ID chip is removed, a pair of dark glasses and a hooded sweatshirt are enough to allow Olham to roam a cityscape crawling with cops, where his ''wanted'' poster is projected on every wall and even on the magnetic dome that has replaced the sky. The world government architects have also thoughtfully fitted out their buildings with plenty of ducts, shafts and abandoned aqueducts for last-minute escapes.''Impostor'' offers a dark view of the future -- a badly lighted one, that is. Outside the magnetic shield, in the Zone, which houses misfits, criminals and the poor, Olham befriends Cale (Mekhi Phifer), who becomes his reluctant sidekick. The two get into fights with various assailants, but it is hard to see who is doing what to whom, or, given that the dialogue is drowned out in ambient murk, to figure out why. The editing is pointlessly hyperkinetic, never settling for a single camera angle when five, cut together in rapid succession, are available, and cramming nearly every scene with jump-cuts, flashbacks and jarring perspectives. Mr. Sinise, looking stricken and indignant even before Hathaway accuses Olham of being an evil suicide robot bomber, seems as cold and glum as the world around him. The ending is meant to be clouded with ambiguity, but really it is unequivocally happy because it means the movie is over.''Impostor'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has many violent scenes and a moment of soft-focus sexuality.

FILM REVIEW; Missing: One Ruby. Will Kill to Get It Back. - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from September 28, 2001, Section E, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. Like a lot of other movies opening this fall, ''Don't Say a Word'' suffers from the timing of its release. After Sept. 11 there may not be much appetite for a thriller about a day of stress and distress in Manhattan. A climactic scene in which a bad guy is buried alive in an avalanche of dirt, dust and falling beams inadvertently conjures up some horrific associations. Every time the camera pulled back to reveal a portion of the New York skyline, the audience at the sneak preview I attended caught its collective breath, and I began to wonder if the movie had been hastily edited to limit its vistas to midtown and the Upper West Side. Toward the end, as the action shifted north, the screen filled with a sunset vista of the whole island, and the glimpse of the martyred towers of the World Trade Center on the far left was met with audible gasps. Then, searching for an apt expression for an unexpected, almost unnamable emotion, a few people quietly clapped their hands. It was a strange, unsettling and curiously moving moment, one that had nothing to do with the film itself, but one that emphasized the confused and confusing enterprise that movie-going, to say nothing of movie reviewing, has recently become. The movie, in any case, is itself a confused and confusing enterprise, with problems that have nothing to do with the accident of its release date. At its center is a plot by a ruthless gang of jewel thieves to recover a ruby they stole from a safe-deposit box 10 years earlier and that was spirited away by a traitorous accomplice. The rest of the gang, having just served 10 years in prison, apparently for killing the double-crosser, kidnaps the 8-year-old daughter of Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas), a brilliant psychiatrist who has no connection to the crime. The criminals believe, however, that they can use him to coax a key piece of information from a mentally ill young woman named Elisabeth (Brittany Murphy). Nathan is given a single day, which happens to be Thanksgiving, to perform this miracle. Meanwhile, Sandra Cassidy (Jennifer Esposito), a tough homicide detective wearing a leather trench coat from the Lady Shaft collection, finds some dead bodies that lead her, somehow, to Nathan's colleague, Dr. Sachs (who, in a serendipitously clever bit of casting, is played by an actor named Oliver -- Platt, to be precise). I wish the director, Gary Fleder, and the screenwriters, Anthony Peckham and Patrick Smith Kelly (who adapted Andrew Klavan's novel), had thought to include a scene of the bad guys hatching their nefarious scheme. Like a team of script writers, they seem to have striven for maximum complexity despite the risks. The diverse band -- including an English-accented leader (Sean Bean), a long-haired, tattooed biker type (Conrad Goode) and a motor-mouth black fellow (Guy Torry) -- is clearly smart enough to have quickly mastered video-surveillance, computer and cellphone technology that did not exist when they went to prison (and rich enough to have purchased a bunch of state-of-the-art equipment in spite of their recent incarceration). But these perps were sent up the river in the first place because they murdered their ex-confederate on a crowded subway platform in front of dozens of witnesses, which seems like a pretty dumb thing to do. Their kidnapping, though meticulously planned, did not take account of the resourcefulness of a New York psychiatrist and his fetching wife (Famke Janssen), who, though laid up with a broken leg, overpowers one of the thugs. Now just about every thriller arises from a premise that will turn out to be absurd when examined objectively, and that proceeds through a series of improbable developments toward the manufactured surprise of its retrospectively predictable ending. But a good thriller will disarm your skepticism, through either cinematic legerdemain or psychological insight or some combination of the two. Like other recent star-driven Hollywood genre exercises -- ''Along Came a Spider'' and ''The Score'' being this year's obvious examples -- ''Don't Say a Word'' confuses an empty and derivative stylistic bravura with formal cleverness, and a sterile, mechanistic sensationalism with emotional intensity. Despite his profession, Nathan has no psychology of his own but rather a set of behaviors that mark him as a cipher of masculinity under duress. He engages in some bedtime banter with his daughter, gives his wife a sexy sponge bath and races around the kitchen preparing French toast. Then, by clenching his jaw and adjusting the growl in his voice, he runs the gamut from panic to steely determination to vengeful fury. There is nothing wrong with Mr. Douglas's acting except that we never for a moment lose the awareness that he is doing it. For his part, Mr. Fleder (who also directed ''Kiss the Girls'' and ''Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead'') displays a surface professionalism that only highlights his lack of imagination. The movie's rhythm is hectic and unvarying; the breathless disorientation produced by incessant cross-cutting is clearly his idea of a thrill. But meanwhile, as if counting on the audience to be distracted by the constant back-and-forth, he allows some pretty silly stuff to transpire. When Detective Cassidy sees Nathan spiriting Elisabeth toward the hospital elevators, she calls out to him, even though they have never met before. And although he has just assaulted a security guard and set off a hospital-wide alert, Nathan walks right out of the place with a bruised, blanket-clad patient. Later, the chief bad guy will pass up an opportunity to kill Nathan for a chance to watch one of his henchmen and the poor doctor do battle with fists and shovels. Meanwhile, Detective Cassidy is making her way all alone to a deserted cemetery in the middle of the night. And let's not even get into the mumbo jumbo of Elisabeth's repressed memory. ''I've never been a big fan of Freud's,'' Nathan comments early on. Whatever you say, Doctor.''Don't Say a Word'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

FILM REVIEW; Casanova Complex: Collecting For the Kill - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from October 3, 1997, Section E, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. There is something sad and brave in the spectacle of an actor as dedicated as Morgan Freeman meticulously trying to infuse his stock character in the thriller ''Kiss the Girls'' with a dramatic integrity that transcends the genre. As Alex Cross, a police forensic psychologist and crime reporter whose niece is kidnapped by a madman and forcibly inducted into his personal harem, Mr. Freeman projects a kindness, patience and canny intelligence that cut against the movie's fast pace and pumped-up shock effects. His performance is so measured it makes you want to believe in the movie much more than its gimmicky jerry-built plot ever permits.''Kiss the Girls,'' adapted from a novel by James Patterson, is cut from the same cloth as ''The Silence of the Lambs,'' but the piece of material it uses has the uneven shape and dangling threads of a discarded remnant. It also has a hole in its center. Because the film is an overly tricky whodunit, not a psychological portrait, there is no Hannibal Lecter-like villain to identify with and loathe. All you get is the obscured face and echoed oracular voice of the fiend, a connoisseur of beautiful, gifted women, who calls himself Casanova and sees his victims as specimens in a carefully amassed collection. Not until the end of the film is Casanova's identity disclosed. And the revelation doesn't track at all with what we've seen and heard of the monster. Like many movies of its type, ''Kiss the Girls,'' directed by Gary Fleder from a screenplay by David Klass, begins promisingly, then loses its direction as the demand for accelerated action overtakes narrative logic. The most gripping scenes, which come early in the film, follow the kidnapping and escape from Casanova's rural North Carolina dungeon of Kate Mctiernan (Ashley Judd), a feisty young doctor and kick-boxing student. Abducted from her home, Kate is drugged and thrown into Casanova's creepy underground lair, where she joins a group of young women whom the police have identified as missing persons. The only clues to Casanova's mentality are found on the dead bodies of the few women executed after being caught trying to escape. Kate's headlong dash through a forest with her captor in panting pursuit is one of the more hair-raising recent Hollywood chase sequences. But once it's over, the movie never replenishes its adrenaline. Ms. Judd, with her dry, no-nonsense intelligence, succeeds in making Kate a complicated, high-strung competitor. And once Kate and Alex team up to track down Casanova, you hope the actors' combined smarts will keep the movie afloat. But it is at exactly this point that it begins to fall apart in a confusing sidetrack that takes the pair to California, where they chase down a collaborator and competitor of Casanova's. By the time they return to North Carolina, the movie has lost its rhythm along with whatever scant credibility it has accumulated.''Kiss the Girls'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some gory violence, strong language, sexual situations and flashes of nudity. KISS THE GIRLSDirected by Gary Fleder; written by David Klass, based on the novel by James Patterson; director of photography, Aaron Schneider; edited by William Steinkamp and Harvey Rosenstock; music by Mark Isham; production designer, Nelson Coates; produced by David Brown and Joe Wizan; released by Paramount Pictures.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. You can hardly blame Laurence Fishburne in ""Fled"" for glowering like someone who has just bitten into an apple and swallowed a mouthful of worms. This shoddy super-violent thriller -- Mr. Fishburne's action-adventure debut -- is so far beneath his talents that throughout the movie he exudes a palpable sense of disgust. Even when rocketing around on a motorcycle and romancing Salma Hayek, he looks as if he would like to be anywhere but stuck in a brainless chase film that tries (and fails) to make Atlanta look as glamorously sleazy as Miami.""Fled,"" which was directed by Kevin Hooks from a screenplay by Preston A. Whitmore 2d, is a transparent bid to establish Mr. Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin as challengers to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise. But the situations are so ludicrous and the screenplay so barren of wit that the best it can come up with in the way of jokey humor is to have the characters compare their adventures to scenes in other movies. As the two flee a prison work camp chained to each other (shades of ""The Defiant Ones""), Mr. Fishburne's character, Piper, shouts, ""Did you see 'The Fugitive'? Tommy Lee Jones set up roadblocks."" Before it's all over, similar references to ""Deliverance,"" ""The Godfather,"" ""Shaft"" and (in a final in-joke) ""What's Love Got to Do With It?"" have thudded from the screen. The movie is one long explosion-riddled chase that begins on a chain gang and follows its embattled heroes as they are simultaneously pursued by gangsters and Federal marshals. Fresh from the Georgia backwoods, they hurtle into Atlanta on a tour that includes a topless bar, a Japanese massage parlor, the Georgia Dome and an unspectacular geological attraction called Stone Mountain Park. Neither Piper nor Mr. Baldwin's character, Dodge, turns out to be the hardened criminal he first appears to be. Dodge is a computer hacker with Robin Hood instincts who has stolen $25 million from a corporation that is a front for the Cuban Mafia. Both the mobsters and the state attorney general are desperate to get their hands on a computer disk containing the corporation's financial records. Also hanging around, for no discernible dramatic purpose, is a renegade investigator, whom Will Patton plays as a kind of cracker Columbo. As tough-guy adversaries who turn into buddies, Mr. Fishburne and Mr. Baldwin have no comradely chemistry. Mr. Fishburne remains lost in his own brooding world, while Mr. Baldwin lopes along with a genial nonchalance that suggests that he, too, has given up on the film and decided to coast as best he can.""Fled"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It is very violent and has one scene of torture and another of a topless dancer. FLEDDirected by Kevin Hooks; written by Preston A. Whitmore 2d; director of photography, Matthew F.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. There's a mug in Gary Fleder's ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"" who talks wistfully about his dream: to ""do the foxtrot with a $2,000-a-night hooker in Paris."" Students of this form -- the one involving hip criminals, heavy-duty jive, a big crime gone wrong and a luncheonette for holding group meetings -- will immediately recognize foxtrot as the essential word. Paris? Ho-hum. Same for hookers, especially hookers with high prices. But the dance connotes a debonair flamboyance, a certain rakish style. And style is everything -- the only thing -- in a movie like this. Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"" (the title is borrowed from a Warren Zevon song that has hip insouciance the film can only dream of) is such a prime example of its genre that it verges on parody. But nobody's kidding. And Mr. Fleder's very real talents are submerged in self-congratulatory, derivative material that's about nothing but hollow posturing and the world of other films. The story concerns Jimmy the Saint (Andy Garcia), a fashion plate with underworld connections, who is forced by The Man With the Plan (Christopher Walken) to undertake a violent crime. Mr. Walken, who has outdone Dennis Hopper and all sense of reason in racking up such roles, plays his part insinuatingly in a wheelchair, sucking on a control tube and graphically explaining his bathroom procedures and his feelings about his nurse. That kind of talk is a badge of accomplishment here, since the film's first scene has Jack Warden (as the younger hoods' hip paterfamilias) declaring that the only good movement is a bowel movement, and so on. The screenplay by Scott Rosenberg is peppered with such flourishes, along with throwaway racism and anti-gay wisecracks. Its excess reaches a pinnacle when one character is accused (accurately) of having eaten excrement while in prison. What's supposed to make this amusing, beyond Treat Williams's comic indignation, is the sight of a children's birthday party within earshot of the debate. That contrast comes close to being funny but not close enough. Mr. Rosenberg, like Mr. Fleder, is capable of real cleverness without knowing when to stop. His screenplay competes in the overwriting Olympics with lines like ""girls who glide go for guys who make them thump"" or the would-be catch-phrases (""boat drinks,"" ""buckwheats,"" ""give it a name"") scattered everywhere. It's true that even Mr. Rosenberg's fulsome dialogue is sharply memorable, as when a beauty named Dagney (his names are memorable, too) invites Jimmy into her apartment on their first date. ""Do you want to come in?"" asks Gabrielle Anwar, definitely a girl who glides in this role. ""More than I want the ascot to come back into style, but not tonight,"" Jimmy replies. The Reservoir Doggerel goes into highest gear once it becomes clear that the film really sees Jimmy as saintly, and that its second hour will consist of soggy long goodbyes. This part of the film, in which tough guys declare that ""life goes by faster than summer vacation,"" sees a flowering of the film's doomy romanticism along with the unfortunate breakup of Jimmy's colorful gang. These henchmen include Pieces, a porn-movie projectionist with physical problems that suggest leprosy (Christopher Lloyd) and Critical Bill, a psycho (Mr. Williams) who works at a funeral home and exercises by punching the corpses. ""It keeps my powder dry, Jimmy,"" explains Critical Bill, nicely handling the film's John Travolta comeback role while delivering one of Mr. Rosenberg's better lines. With Bill Nunn and William Forsythe rounding out the well-cast team of hoods, Steve Buscemi as a silent hit man and Fairuza Balk in the obnoxious role of a strung-out streetwalker who wants to have Jimmy's baby, the film has a lot of talent in its favor. And it has a photogenic pair of lovers in Ms. Anwar and Mr. Garcia. Her presence sweetens some of the film's most blatant contrivances, like a love scene ominously set among extinct creatures in a natural history museum. Mr. Garcia gives one of his sleeker dreamboat performances after a disastrous dual comic role in ""Steal Big, Steal Little,"" the summer's sorriest flop. The device the film shows off most proudly is that of Afterlife Advice: Jimmy works for a video company that lets the dying prerecord pearls of wisdom for their loved ones. But when the video clips play back periodically during the story, they sound as self-conscious and artificial as what the still-living characters have to say. ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nonstop creative obscenities, graphic violence and sexual references.

This last role is played by Marika Roekk, a limber redhead with a fire-engine personality to match. There are several more impersonations—we lost count. At least somebody has the grace to say, at one point, ""Who aren't you?"" The capering is loud, wooden and interminable. Only Boy Gobert, as a suave prince (he really is, too) and Marianne Cook as the lovely heroine, Rosalinde, behave like adults. Around and occasionally behind the din comes the Strauss music—spilling forth in song and group dancing or thumping away in the background. A couple of the numbers have been streamlined within an inch of their lives. There's a snappy cha-cha arrangement that probably would make the composer do a backflip. And one gaudy dance ensemble, right out of a high-kicking Warner musical, can best be described as red hot.

"THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; ' Die Fledermaus' ('The Bat'), German-Made Picture, Opens at Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse - The New York Times","in the Russian zone, presumably—after the war. But a bit of investigation through official film agencies has revealed that this picture was actually made by Germans in Vienna during the war and the footage was seized by the Russians when they occupied Germany. Without apparent reluctance to trade in the former enemy's goods, the Soviet cinema people have sent this film along as a post-war Berlin job. Even without investigation, the nature of the picture should arouse the suspicions of the unwary, for it is expensively and elaborately produced beyond the likely facilities of any post-war studio in Berlin. And the cast is studded with actors who were familiar in Nazi films, some of whom lacked ""clearance"" for a good while after the war. Beyond that, it's not a picture to arouse excitement or concern—and, indeed, in the run of foreign pictures it would barely pass as a noticeable job. Filmed in a German color process (Agfa) which has been awesomely forecast, it is pale and unpleasantly watery in comparison with a Technicolored film. And its lavish production, while gaudy and rococo in nineteenth-century Viennese style, has the obvious appearance of a photographed warehouse auction sale. In telling the old familiar story of ""Die Fledermaus"" (or ""The Bat""), which was told in the Johann Strauss opera back in 1874, it rambles about with the libretto to a considerable extent without any more of the opera's music than a couple of waltzes and a song or two. And, except for a very amusing performance by Joseph Egger as the prison guard, the cast is heavy. Teutonic in coyness and lacking utterly in Viennese charm.

Memo to Walt Disney Studios: If ""Kazaam"" is the sort of movie you intend to eliminate in your plans to cut back on production and distribution, thanks. Kazaam,"" from Touchstone Pictures, an arm of Disney, stars Mr. O'Neal as a genie. As genies go -- and the Disney people, who gave the world the animated ""Aladdin"" of 1992, ought to know -- Mr. O'Neal can't hold a flickering lamp to Robin Williams. Mr. O'Neal, of course, is a major star, but only if we're talking basketball, where he happens to excel for the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association. As a result of his athletic fame and a warm smile, he has been marketed with success as a spokesman for athletic footwear, soft drinks and fast food and as a rap artist. In ""Kazaam,"" Mr. O'Neal (who is also credited as an executive producer) has plenty of help, beginning with an idea from Paul M. Glaser, the director and co-producer, who first achieved his own fame as Starsky of the television series ""Starsky and Hutch.""Mr. O'Neal should have slam-dunked the script into the nearest wastebasket, because unfortunately, Christian Ford and Roger Soffer translated Mr. Glaser's idea into a screenplay that seems to have missed the central point about fairy tales involving genies or fairy godmothers: the people they help ought to seem worthy of magical intervention by first capturing our sympathy. But as the genie's beneficiary, ""Kazaam"" serves up an obnoxious 12-year-old punk named Max (played by Francis Capra), who seems not so much an urban Huck Finn of the 1990's as a candidate for serious therapy, juvenile detention or both. Disengaged from schoolwork, prey to a roving band of bullies, unhappy with a home where his harried, hard-working mother (Ally Walker) is planning to finalize her divorce and establish a new life with her fireman boyfriend (John Costelloe), Max takes refuge from the bullies one day in an abandoned lamp factory. And there, when he plunges through several levels of rotting floors, he comes to rest on a boombox and releases the the 5,000-year-old Kazaam. Before long, the unhappy Max's search for the father who hasn't seen him in 10 years leads him and Kazaam to a club where they become involved with a villain named Malik (Marshall Manesh), assorted thugs, pirated recordings and other distractions that imperil the boy, his father and Kazaam's magical boombox. In the end, of course, Max manages do some good and Kazaam is promoted to jinn, which frees him from the slave status of genies. As fairy tale, buddy comedy, family drama, thriller or rap revue, ""Kazaam"" is simply uninspired and unconvincing, and Mr. O'Neal, who can carry a basketball team, lacks the charisma to rescue this misguided effort. As one of the showy women in ""Kazaam"" informs the villain: ""He's tall. That doesn't mean he's interesting.""""Kazaam"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

The film cuts back and forth from present-day Hungary to medieval times, when Christianity was replacing goddess worship, to create an allegorical puzzle, whose pieces fit together only at the very end. Far more complex and abstruse than Ms. Enyedi's 1990 film, ""My 20th Century,"" ""Magic Hunter"" is an unwieldy stylistic hybrid of narrative film making and arty montage. Because its contemporary characters are empty symbolic figures, the film's surreal moments have more impact than its convoluted story. Periodically, the film stops in its tracks to contemplate images of nature. Tibor Mathe's luminous close-up pictures of a falling acorn and of a snail proceeding slowly across a wooden bridge have a visionary flair. In the film's most striking scene, a rabbit fleeing a pack of dogs takes refuge under the skirt of the Virgin Mary, who has appeared in a forest. At the very last second, the Virgin and the rabbit metamorphose into a painting that medieval worshipers have brought into the woods. These images are crudely inserted into a story that begins with a mother telling her young daughter the tale of a marksman who sells his soul to the Devil for a handful of magic bullets. There is one condition: the Devil may determine the path of the final bullet. From here, ""Magic Hunter"" focuses on the storyteller's husband, Max (Gary Kemp), a police marksman in present-day Budapest. Peering through his telescopic sights at a desperado holding a young woman hostage, he pulls his trigger at the wrong moment, striking the woman instead of her captor. Horrified at his mistake, he is reassured when Kaspar (Peter Vallai), a Mephistophelean senior officer on the police force, gives him some magic bullets, which he squanders in target practice until only one remains. Max's next assignment is to protect a visiting Russian chess master (Alexander Kaidanovsky), who is in danger of assassination. By sheer coincidence, Max's wife (Sadie Frost) and daughter (Alexandra Wasscher) strike up an acquaintance with the Russian while frolicking in a park, and Max finds himself observing a developing friendship that he fears might evolve into an adulterous affair. In contemplating the elements of chance and fate in human life, ""Magic Hunter"" examines some of the same themes that preoccupied the Polish film maker Krzysztof Kieslowski, who died three months ago. But ""Magic Hunter"" is klutzy and vague in its symbolic connections, and because its characters never come to life, the film has no moral force. It is a rambling cinematic essay pretending to be a movie.

"‘Carol Channing: Larger Than Life,’ by Dori Berinstein - The New York Times","Carol Channing is 91 going on 7. That is meant as a compliment. When she was 7, this great theatrical clown recalls in Dori Berinstein’s documentary “Carol Channing: Larger Than Life,” she stepped onto a stage for the first time and realized she was “walking on hallowed ground.” Ms. Channing seems never to have suffered from opening-night jitters. For her, she says, “the safest place in the world to be is center stage.” Only once has she missed a performance (or rather, half a performance), when she became ill from food poisoning. A preternatural self-confidence and buoyancy infuse every syllable out of Ms. Channing’s mouth in this entertaining film, which is crammed with show business lore that dates to her discovery of her original idol, Ethel Waters, singing “Supper Time” in the 1930s Irving Berlin revue “As Thousands Cheer.”“Larger Than Life” means having a personality that is too big for the big screen, though Ms. Channing has been in a number of movies, most notably “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” in 1967. “This creature with huge saucer eyes, gigantic red lips and a massive smile,” as the comedian Bruce Vilanch describes her, is her own special creation. With her fake eyelashes and raspy yawp of a voice, she has inspired many a drag queen imitation. A stranger once told her, “You’re the best Carol Channing I’ve ever seen,” then asked her who she really was. She replied, “A truck driver from Toledo.” To the designer Bob Mackie, she embodies a vanishing breed of “old-time vaudeville stars who were the same character on and offstage.” Broadway cognoscenti know that Ms. Channing owns the role of Dolly Levi, the indomitable matchmaker she played in the 1964 Broadway hit “Hello, Dolly!,” and has performed it more than 5,000 times. A younger generation is more likely to identify Dolly with Barbra Streisand, who played her in the show’s not-so-thrilling screen adaptation. Although Ms. Channing tactfully refrains from commenting on Ms. Streisand’s Dolly, she manages to register her distaste. The film lightly glosses over the facts of her biography. An only child, she was brought up a Christian Scientist in San Francisco, attended Bennington College, made a splash on Broadway in the 1948 revue “Lend an Ear” and achieved stardom in 1949 as the original Lorelei in “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.” There is a wonderful montage of her playing Lorelei at different ages. An inordinate amount of time is spent following Ms. Channing around with her fourth husband, Harry Kullijian, the junior high school sweetheart with whom she reconnected after nearly 70 years and married in 2003. The film was completed before his death in December. What she calls her “lousy” 42-year third marriage to her manager and publicist Charles Lowe, who is described as cold and controlling, is perfunctorily noted. A chorus line of admirers sings Ms. Channing’s praises as a radiant, irrepressible life force. Leading the list is Jerry Herman, who wrote the score for “Hello, Dolly!,” having been instructed by the producer David Merrick to write songs for Ethel Merman. Merman turned down the role. We hear the oft-told tale of the show’s troubled out-of-town tryouts in Buffalo; Mr. Herman stayed up late one night to write the game-saving “Before the Parade Passes By” and insisted on playing it for Ms. Channing in the wee hours. Testimonials and remembrances come from Barbara Walters, Lily Tomlin, Tommy Tune, Jo Anne Worley (Ms. Channing’s understudy in “Dolly”), Marge Champion, Chita Rivera, Debbie Reynolds and Tyne Daly. The dancers known as “the Dolly Boys” from the show’s 1995 Broadway revival are shown reuniting with Ms. Channing to rehearse for the 2010 Gypsy of the Year, the annual Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS benefit in New York City. Another old friend, Betty Garrett, who died last February, reminisces with Ms. Channing about their days working together at a summer theater. Both recall their first screen kisses: Ms. Garrett’s from Frank Sinatra, and Ms. Channing’s from the young Clint Eastwood in the 1956 movie “The First Traveling Saleslady.” “It was the rottenest clinch they ever had in a movie,” Ms. Channing says after describing their awkward practice session. “They cut it. They had to.”“Carol Channing: Larger Than Life” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has brief smoking.",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/movies/carol-channing-larger-than-life-by-dori-berinstein.html
Just a Guy and His Elephant - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from November 1, 1996, Section C, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. How could a comedy based on the tantalizingly funny notion of Bill Murray transporting a circus elephant across America misfire as badly as ''Larger Than Life''? The very idea conjures up visions of classic sight gags in which man and beast fail to communicate, or worse, fail to get along. Think of elegant circus tricks executed in the wrong place at precisely the wrong time. Think of an elephantine stubbornness that makes the most recalcitrant donkey look like an obedient eager beaver. Think of a rampage in a supermarket or a spontaneous grand entrance at a chi-chi social event, and you can begin to see the possibilities. But comedy is a surprisingly delicate mechanism. All it takes to dash such fantasies is a director with no instinct for the sight gag, and the most carefully prepared comic bits fizzle like soggy firecrackers. Although the screenplay by Roy Blount Jr. comes up with some potentially sidesplitting situations, the director, Howard Franklin, who shepherded Mr. Murray through the equally limp ''Quick Change'' six years ago, methodically subverts them. Take the scene in which Mr. Murray, whose character, Jack Corcoran, a cynical motivational speaker, decides to ride the elephant (named Vera) but can't figure out how to mount her. A logistical problem worthy of at least five minutes of pratfalls is solved in less than two laugh-free minutes. Or take the scene in which Vera lies down beside the freight car onto which Jack hopes to ship her westward. Instead of imagining slapstick ways of coaxing an animal with a will of its own onto a train, the movie throws up its hands and cuts away from the scene. The next shot finds the train gliding along with Vera comfortably ensconced. When early in the film, Jack inherits Vera from his father, a circus clown, he is informed of the animal's stupendous daily intake of food and water. But except for one scene in which Jack orders the contents of an entire salad bar, the satisfying of Vera's physical needs during a trip that finds the two traipsing through the Rocky Mountains and the badlands of New Mexico is barely addressed. You would think that given Hollywood's fondness for potty humor, some reference would be made to Vera's need for an elephant-size cat box. Not a mention. Vera appears to be virtually odor free.''Larger Than Life'' misuses or underutilizes most of the actors in its fine supporting cast. Matthew McConaughey so overplays the part of Tip Tucker, a psychotic speed-demon cowboy trucker, that most of what he says is unintelligible. He sounds like a demented auctioneer speaking in tongues. Playing an ecologically minded elephant expert in the San Diego Zoo who wants to ship Vera back to her natural habitat in Sri Lanka, Janeane Garofalo doesn't have a single funny line. Linda Fiorentino, as an unscrupulous Los Angeles animal tamer, has too little screen time for her part even to register. Mr. Murray exudes his customary mixture of sly self-deprecation and twinkling-eyed resilience. The cross-country journey is supposed to transform Jack from a crass self-improvement huckster into a caring human being, but we never sense any personal sea change. As he and Vera go their separate ways, Mr. Murray simply stands there smiling a secret little smile and looking slightly embarrassed, discreetly aghast, perhaps, at how completely ''Larger Than Life' has blown its golden opportunity.''Larger Than Life'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some strong language.

Kathryn Bertine Examines Pro Cycling in ‘Half the Road’ - The New York Times,"You can’t exactly call “Half the Road” an infomercial for women’s cycling. It’s more like a political campaign ad disguised as a public service announcement, and the message is: Get rid of the U. C. I.’s current leaders. That’s the Union Cycliste Internationale, the organization that its detractors can’t just walk away from, because it has the power to award Olympic qualification points. Kathryn Bertine’s talking heads, many of them gifted athletes who have to work full-time civilian jobs to pay the mortgage, have a rock-solid argument. Men’s cycling offers ridiculously higher prize money and gets a lot more attention than women’s. A number of women say they could die happy if they just had the chance to do the Tour de France. But the message is repeated ad infinitum; this documentary is painfully long for a project of this kind. Although the film’s subtitle is “The Passion, Pitfalls & Power of Women’s Professional Cycling,” the closest Ms. Bertine, a former ESPN columnist, comes to conveying that passion is near the end, when little girls just beginning to race talk about their love for the sport. You can almost feel the wind in their hair (even though they’re wearing helmets).",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/movies/kathryn-bertine-examines-pro-cycling-in-half-the-road.html
"‘Cape Spin,’ a Documentary About Cape Wind - The New York Times","130 turbines across a 24-square-mile stretch of Nantucket Sound — has stirred furious dissent. The installation would be the nation’s first offshore wind farm, reducing the fossil fuel emissions around coastal Massachusetts and helping to develop a clean-energy industry. But residents howl that the project would despoil a pristine seascape, damage fishing grounds, foul ferry and air traffic and even disrupt the religious practices of the Wampanoag tribe. “Cape Spin: An American Power Struggle” lets both sides argue, leaving no contention unheard. Its directors, Robbie Gemmel and John Kirby, show the professional “grass roots” campaigns vying for advantage at the statehouse and in Washington. Along with the very wealthy who don’t want their ocean views disturbed, environmentalists are often the very residents chanting, “right idea, wrong location.” Robert Kennedy Jr., an alternative-energy advocate who still opposes Cape Wind, is filmed sailing in the sound, trading bullhorn arguments with a Greenpeace crew that has come to support it. After years of hearings, environmental impact statements, rallies and op-eds, “Cape Spin” builds to a 2010 decision by the interior secretary at the time, Ken Salazar, on whether to let the project proceed. It’s no spoiler to say that, after the decision, the losing side vows to fight on. “Cape Spin” stumbles in force-feeding some easy mockery: a radio debate between campaign spokeswomen, for example, is framed as a boxing match. More disappointing is the film’s studied neutrality, reciting talking points yet failing to drill beneath them. A documentary should give audiences insights they can’t get elsewhere. Otherwise, it’s just one more tumble in an endless media churn.",http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/movies/cape-spin-a-documentary-about-cape-wind.html
‘The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975’ - Review - The New York Times,"and Sweden’s in particular — of presenting an overly negative view of American society. Mr. Olsson’s film does not entirely refute that charge, but the impression it leaves is of a compassionate curiosity, a willingness to listen that Americans have not always, then or now, afforded one another. The voices of contentious, well-known figures like Angela Davis and Louis Farrakhan are heard, as are those of ordinary residents of Harlem, Brooklyn and Oakland, Calif. As its title suggests, “The Black Power Mixtape” is not a comprehensive history. Its impressionistic visual record of recent history is accompanied by the present-day reflections of participants in that history and younger people who have been influenced by it. Ms. Davis, the poet Sonia Sanchez and Abiodun Oyewole of the Last Poets muse on the meaning and legacy of black power, as do the musicians Erykah Badu, Questlove, John Forté and others. Their words sometimes deepen the viewer’s appreciation of what is on screen, though at other times the nuances and contradictions of the past outstrip the didacticism of the commentary. But the fact that the speakers’ faces are never seen produces a feeling of estrangement that is crucial to the film’s effectiveness. You become acutely aware of gaps and discontinuities: between slogans and realities, between political ideals and stubborn social problems, between then and now. And you are left in a bracing state of confusion, wondering how much has changed and how the change took place. How did we get from the America of Stokely Carmichael to the America of Barack Obama, who represents a very different kind of black power? To what extent is it the same America? Perhaps there are some visitors from Sweden out there who can help us make sense of it all. THE BLACK POWER MIXTAPE 1967-1975Opens on Friday in Manhattan.

Pete Seeger: The Power of Song - Movies - Review - The New York Times,"Jim Brown’s loving documentary, “Pete Seeger: The Power of Song” — makes clear, he’s still busy, still angry, still hopeful, still singing. Mr. Seeger does not perform as much as he used to, and his reedy tenor has lost some of its force, but he still chops wood outside his home in the Hudson Valley, protests against war and plays the banjo about as well as anyone ever has. Those of us who grew up on his songs sometimes take him for granted, as our youthful enthusiasm for his versions of “Abiyoyo” and “Froggy Went a-Courtin’” give way to more sophisticated pleasures, like Mr. Springsteen or Mr. Earle. But Mr. Brown’s documentary reminds us, with admirable thoroughness, why we shouldn’t take Pete Seeger for granted. He is, for one thing, more complicated than he might seem at first, much in the way that the folk music he adores reveals hidden nuances beneath apparently simple stories and tunes. It’s true that, in his performances, he suppressed some of those nuances, especially when they touched on matters of sex, murder or religion, but he also did an awful lot to popularize and preserve the beauty and strangeness of the American musical vernacular. The son of an academic musicologist and a gifted violinist, he has always looked and sounded less like the product of Eastern boarding schools than like a figure out of 19th-century legend: gangly, with a deliberate manner of speaking and the zealous gleam of true belief in his eye. The belief to which he attached his zeal — Communism — has made him an intermittently controversial figure since at least the 1940s. Mr. Brown revisits those years, and allows a few of Mr. Seeger’s detractors to have a brief say. I wish they or someone had pushed a little harder into the reality that lay beneath the beautiful abstractions of peace, justice and democracy that American Communists claimed to embrace. Yes, they were idealists, but most were damnably slow to acknowledge the monstrous truth about the Soviet paradise they defended. And while many of them, including Mr. Seeger, suffered banishment and harassment as a result of their political affiliations, the crimes of Joseph R. McCarthy and his allies come nowhere near those of Stalin. But at the same time there is something irreducibly absurd in attaching the epithet un-American to a man whose banjo style can take you from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta and beyond in the space of a single song. I’m not saying that the music redeems the politics. For one thing, Mr. Seeger would surely refuse to make such a distinction, and for another, the person who introduced “We Shall Overcome” to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and who later spearheaded the cleanup of the Hudson River, does not have much to apologize for. By the same token, a country that closed its airwaves for 17 years to one of its foremost musical patriots (so called by no less an authority than Johnny Cash) has some explaining to do. “Pete Seeger: The Power of Song” uses standard documentary methods — old clips and recent interviews with old-time colleagues like Ronnie Gilbert and Lee Hays and present-day admirers like Mr. Springsteen and Natalie Maines, all of it accompanied by plenty of music — to offer an affectionate, detailed portrait of its subject. The most touching and revealing moments come when Mr. Seeger’s wife, Toshi, and their three children recall some of the challenges of living with a stubborn, itinerant folk singer. When you hear their accounts of how he built the family cabin with his bare hands on a hillside in Beacon, N. Y., you begin to see what a deeply American, fundamentally conservative temperament he has. And this impression is deepened as you reflect on both the content of his music and his methods of making it. Famous as he is, Mr. Seeger seems to exist outside of, and in opposition to, the commercial machinery of celebrity. His sensibility is cosmopolitan but also agrarian, devoted to land, family and community — to traditional American values, you might say. In two years he’ll be 90. He is an institution and a monument, but also a living presence whose best songs grow less quaint and more urgent every day, and who can drive some listeners crazy even as he moves others to tears. If you watch the video (included in this film) of him singing “Waist Deep in the Big Muddy” on CBS in 1968, you’ll know just what I mean. “Pete Seeger: The Power of Song” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some mild thematic material. PETE SEEGERThe Power of SongOpens today in Manhattan. Directed by Jim Brown; directors of photography, Mr. Brown, Tom Hurwitz and Bobby Shepard; edited by Sam Pollard and Jason L. Pollard; produced by Michael Cohl, William Eigen and Mr. Brown; released by the Weinstein Company and Concert Productions International.

FILM REVIEW; American Know-How Can't Prevail Nohow - The New York Times,"''Power Trip,'' Paul Devlin's superbly balanced and organized documentary about the politics of electricity in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, offers a cautionary reminder that the basic services we take for granted in the United States are often luxuries elsewhere. It also underscores what became painfully evident at the height of the Enron scandal: political power and the distribution of energy are intimately connected. That scandal gave Americans a nasty little taste of the politics of energy when electrical bills skyrocketed in California; the recent blackout in the Northeast also sent an ominous signal that our overtaxed power grid was susceptible to breakdown. Those troubles are nothing compared to the dire situation in Georgia. The recent ouster of its president, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, only underscores what the movie reveals about the systemic corruption of his regime. At the same time the perspective of the film is too sophisticated to demonize any one figure. The movie's vision of a country teetering on the brink of chaos is seen largely through the eyes of Piers Lewis, a good-humored British-born project director for AES-Telasi, the company that was created in late 1990's when the AES Corporation of Arlington, Va., acquired the Georgian power authority, Telasi. AES officials had no idea what they were facing. The story of the company's struggle to become efficient and profitable plays like an absurdist political farce. When Georgia was a constituent of the Soviet Union, electrical power was state controlled and free. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Georgia slid into chaos and civil war, and utility services crumbled. Desperate for electricity, the citizens improvised crude wiring systems to steal power. The movie opens with a succinct sketch of Georgia's unhappy history with its neighbors, then picks up its story shortly after the formation of of AES-Telasi. Outraged to find monthly utility bills (about $24) amounting to half their incomes, the people rebelled by refusing to pay. Noncompliance was as high as 90 percent. Faced with mounting losses, AES adopted a get-tough policy in which whole neighborhoods were blacked out until bills were paid, prompting street demonstrations. The well-meaning company invested millions to build new power lines and establish a secure metering system. When the airport at the capital city, Tbilisi, wouldn't pay its electric bill, AES cut its power until it paid. Other large industries with government connections also refused to pay. Ultimately the fate of AES-Telasi, revealed at the end of the movie, was determined as much by American events like the Enron scandal as by Georgian resistance.''Power Trip,'' which opens today at Film Forum in New York, is a skillful assemblage of newsreel clips, cartoons ridiculing the American interlopers, television commercials and interviews with power officials and ordinary Georgians. It gives new and darker meaning to that comfy adage ''We're all connected.''POWER TRIPProduced, directed and edited by Paul Devlin; in English and Georgian, with English subtitles; directors of photography, Mr. Devlin and Valery Odikadze.

I. T. linguist and longtime critic of American foreign policy, reflects on the current state of the world. Apart from the intermittent soundtrack music -- which sounds a bit like Japanese versions of obscure Neil Young songs -- the film, which opens today in Manhattan, would not be out of place on C-Span, which occasionally broadcasts Mr. Chomsky's public appearances. For his admirers, it might serve as a footnote to ''Manufacturing Consent,'' Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick's 1992 film, which is more comprehensive and more ambitious (and more than twice as long). That film explores Mr. Chomsky's linguistic theories as well as his views on politics and the media, and it gives his critics a few chances to speak up. Mr. Junkerman, an American filmmaker who works in Japan, is clearly sympathetic to his subject. The opening credits unspool a string of testimonials to Mr. Chomsky's courage and integrity, and the packed campus lecture halls greet him with standing ovations. At the conclusion of his talks, a crowd generally gathers by the stage to pepper him with questions or pester him for autographs, and he graciously obliges. A sampling of audience opinion after one of the talks gathers praise for his ''encyclopedic knowledge.'' ''I agree with everything he said,'' one woman declares. Most of the audience for ''Power and Terror'' will probably feel the same way. Mr. Chomsky is a figure who inspires intense devotion, and equally intense revulsion; he is an intellectual hero to some and, to others, the embodiment of reflexive left-wing anti-Americanism. This polarization has only increased as his book on the causes and consequences of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 has become a best seller. At the same time, though, as Mr. Chomsky acknowledges in the film, a searching and wide-ranging debate has unfolded about America's response to terrorism and, more broadly, about the history and future of its role in the world. Mr. Junkerman's film is best understood as a necessary, if partisan, text in that continuing argument. The film does not delve into some of Mr. Chomsky's more controversial post-9/11 statements, like his equating of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon with the 1998 American bombing of a Sudanese pharmaceuticals factory, or his characterization of the United States war against the Taliban as genocidal. It presents, instead, a more general outline of his critique of American power, which has been consistent since the early days of the Vietnam war. His criticism seems to be motivated less by an ideological quarrel with the United States -- a country whose ideals and virtues he admires and whose principles of free inquiry and expression have enabled him to speak and publish without fear of suppression -- than by a contempt, rooted in the anarchist political tradition, for the operations of power. Although he opposes all kinds of violence, he is especially concerned with the violence of empires, whose hegemony enables them to escape moral reckoning and political accountability. Even though Mr. Chomsky's arguments are presented with meticulous empirical detail (as well as with modesty, patience and occasional bursts of wit), there is an abstract, theoretical air about them. His moral clarity has its appeal, but it often seems to evade the complexities of the world as it is. It would be much easier if the world were neatly divided into imperial states and helpless, subject peoples (or, for that matter, into forces of freedom and axes of evil), but the categories have a way of getting tangled up -- in the Balkans, in Asia and certainly in the Middle East -- something that Mr. Chomsky, for all his intelligence and discipline, does not always grasp.

"FILM REVIEW; For Children, A Language To Vex Their Parents With - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from July 21, 2000, Section E, Page 10Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. In ''Pokemon the Movie 2000,'' Pikachu and his fellow mystical creatures pursue two new adventures. This program, which seems to have been cobbled out of several episodes of the syndicated television series from Japan, is probably about as good as cut-rate animation that seems to consist of screen savers can be. The first of the two films is ''Pikachu's Rescue Adventure,'' a short. And since the entire program runs less than 90 minutes, what does that make the main feature? Probably way too long for the uninitiated, but that's another story. In the first of the two offerings, Pikachu, the little yellow character with black ears, and his mates, including Squirtle (who resembles a turtle), Snorlax (a penguin with a thyroid problem), Psyduck (a pink tailless platypus) and others, are off to assist several other Pokemon of an eggy sort during an intense and driving rainstorm. With the exception of some complaints voiced by Meowth -- the Pokemon associate of Team Rocket, the bad guys -- no English is spoken. Instead, the short is filled with Pokemon speak and has no subtitles, and it's an inventive way for youngsters to learn a new language. It may be a language they'll be able to use only at Pokemon conventions, or as a way to irritate their parents. Still, some small amount of educational purpose is better than none at all. The Pokemon known as Exegutter emerges by the end, and his name's pronunciation is so similar to executor that some may think the Pokemon have finally found a creature to help plan their estates. In the main feature, Ash, the young trainer who traps and nurtures Pokemon -- and is often the star of the adventures with Pikachu -- has to stop the menacing Collector, a nasty sort who is caging up Pokemon with tremendous powers.''The way you talk, Pokemon are just things to collect,'' Misty, a member of Ash's team, says to the Collector in English -- a remark that will doubtless provoke mirthless laughter from parents. A peculiar dialogue exchange occurs when someone tells Ash, ''If you want someone to do whatever you want, whenever you want, you should find yourself a girlfriend.'' Unfortunately, we do not get to see how this piece of advice complicates Ash's dating life. Perhaps we will in ''Pokemon 3000,'' by which time someone else can disentangle the unwieldy plot machinations found in ''Pokemon 2000,'' which quieted the children with whom I saw it because they, too, were lost. One suspects this is called ''Pokemon the Movie 2000'' not just to remind parents how much cash they have spent on Pokemon products to date, but also because the end of the world is threatened. The millennial message is that one person can make a change, though that person is, as usual, Ash. He vows to stop the Collector from capturing the Pokemon representing the elements of nature, like Moltres (a fire-breather) and Zapdus (who sends out lightning bolts). This would upset the Earth's elemental balance. Even Jessie and James, the villainous Team Rocket, elect to help Ash. Several new Pokemon are introduced, but perhaps the most notable is Ash's mother, Ms. Ketchum. She gives the young adventurer, who wears a hat with an insignia that looks suspiciously like the Lexus logo, a piece of her mind and reminds him that he is her greatest treasure. At this point, parents can gather their greatest treasures and take them home before the end credits.

"'You Have No Choice, Humans.' Really. - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from March 29, 1997, Section 1, Page 17Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. The kind of claptrap and mumbo jumbo that used to be dished out free at Saturday matinees in the form of preposterous serials now commands $8.50 at theaters in Times Square and elsewhere around town. Of course, the production values and special effects in ''Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,'' which opened yesterday, are superior to those of the films of yesteryear. But the formula and drivel are much the same: cackling villains from outer space versus plucky heroes or superheroes defending civilized life on Earth. In ''Turbo,'' directed by David Winning and Shuki Levy, an evil queen named Divatox seeks the power of a Yoda-like wizard named Lerigot and marriage to the really evil Maligore to cap her megalomania. Only the Power Rangers can stop her. Rounding out the ingredients of the latest specimen of the genre are an assortment of hostages, including the wizard and his family; several species of monster, a snake, some cute animals (chimps here), robots and submarines, special automobiles and comic relief in the form of a couple of moronic security guards. And besides a ghostly galleon, a place called the Nemesis Triangle, a lost island and the final showdown with a volcanic monster who looks like charred lobster, there is a martial arts tournament to win money for a shelter for troubled children. Toss in dialogue like, ''You have no choice, humans,'' and, ''May the power protect you,'' and the formula is complete. Five-year-olds who have read their Shakespeare will recognize that ''Turbo'' is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.''Turbo'' is rated PG (parental guidance suggested). There are numerous battles, various monsters, scenes with menacing snakes and lions, and a couple of serious injuries.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. If the words ""Go, go, Power Rangers!"" don't make you hear the television theme song ringing in your head, if you have to ask what a zord is, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers have bypassed your household, saving you a bundle of money. If, on the other hand, you actually know that Tommy is the White Ranger and Billy is the Blue Ranger, you are bound to end up at ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie."" It may give you a headache, if only from thinking about all the new toys it will spawn, but your 5-year-old will probably find it irresistible, more than once. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are to children today exactly what the Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles were to children five years ago: a television series about martial-arts teen-agers who turn into superheros, a merchandising gold mine, and finally a movie. The film resembles three episodes of the television series strung together, with slightly better, splashier special effects. (Given the shabby production values of the series, that isn't hard.)As in the show, the six Rangers are color-coded. When they are zapped through the air to travel to the Command Center -- where Zordon, their Oz-like leader, gives them orders -- they flash on the screen like color bars on a television test pattern. When these ordinary high school students morph and gain power, their costumes become jump suits with helmets. For the movie, those costumes are molded to resemble suits of armor instead of the spandex on television. This movie knows better than to mess around much with a winning formula. The new villain here is Ivan Ooze. He has a purple face, a pointed beard that seems molded from grape bubble gum, and so much latex on his face that the actor (Paul Freeman) seems to have trouble talking. Ivan's henchmen are more fun. When they are karate-kicked against a wall by the Rangers, they go splat and turn into a mass of gloopy purple liquid. But Ivan is effective enough to smash the Command Center, leaving the Rangers just enough energy to travel to a distant planet and find more power so they can save Zordon and civilization. The movie's one strategic mistake is that the Rangers spend far too much time without their power. Instead, they meet someone who introduces herself as ""Dulcea, master warrior."" With her tiny green leather bikini and knee-high boots, she looks more like an actress auditioning for ""Baywatch."" It's a mark of how unrealistically wholesome the Rangers are that the four males fail to drool at this point. And at a recent Saturday morning preview, there was conspicuous fidgeting from children throughout the theater as Dulcea explained, ""Buried deep within each of us is an animal spirit waiting to be released.""The payoff comes when the Rangers return home, powered up and in their zords (special flying vehicles that turn into missile-firing weapons). They battle Ivan's evil creatures, including what looks like a giant aluminum fly with red headlights for eyes.""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" is noisy and meant for children only. A bored grown-up's only consolation is that the Rangers' popularity has probably peaked, and the next kiddie phenomenon must be on the way. Don't even think about what it will cost.""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). As on television, the Power Rangers' battles are cartoonish and harmless, but as ordinary teen-agers they perform some dangerous stunts, like skateboarding down a flight of concrete steps. MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS The MovieDirected by Bryan Spicer; written by Arne Olsen, based on a story by John Kamps and Mr. Olsen; director of photography, Paul Murphy; edited by Wayne Wahrman; production designer, Craig Stearns; produced by Haim Saban, Shuki Levy and Suzanne Todd; released by 20th Century Fox.

Review/Film; A Youngster Against The Power of Apartheid - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from March 27, 1992, Section C, Page 20Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. John G. Avildsen directs the pious South African drama ""The Power of One"" as if it were ""The Anti-Apartheid Kid,"" chronicling the brave attempts of a little blond, blue-eyed boy named P. K. to fight racial injustice. The battle is waged mostly in terms of toothless platitudes (""a waterfall begins with only one drop of water"") and ugly encounters with racist bullies, encounters that Mr. Avildsen prefers shooting in close-up whenever possible. On the affirmative side, the boy's every triumph is accompanied by Johnny Clegg's soaring choral music (and Hans Zimmer's instrumental score). P. K. (played by three actors of different ages, none of whom especially resemble the others) is introduced as a small, wise child during a shapeless preamble. Typically, this part of the film is edited so unemphatically that it appears to place equal emphasis on the little boy's bed-wetting and the death of his mother. It is half an hour before the excellent Morgan Freeman and Armin Mueller-Stahl enter P. K.'s story as an African prison inmate and the boy's kindly German grandfather, thus giving the film at least some reason to exist. The grandfather, Doc, has been incarcerated by South African authorities for the duration of World War II, and P. K. follows him to prison. ""Inside, everyone was concerned with just one thing -- the outcome of the inter-prison boxing championships,"" P. K. says in voice-over, thereby explaining the presence of Mr. Avildsen (""Rocky"" I and V, ""The Karate Kid"" I, II and II) in these unfamiliar waters. When an older P. K. enrolls in high school (where the vastly overqualified John Gielgud has been cast as his headmaster), another boxing tournament lies in store. The film's facile treatment of racial issues may be enough to bring back the practice of throwing tomatoes at the screen. Huge throngs of black extras (many played by members of the Masibemunye Bulawayo Choir, a large choral group that provides much of the stirring score) are often seen responding admiringly to the overtures of a lone white boy. At one point, the adolescent P. K. (Simon Fenton) even tries to conduct their musical efforts, though he demonstrably has no talent. When the 18-year-old P. K. (Stephen Dorff) jogs through a black township, he is treated with similar reverence. The film's black characters are even said to believe P. K. has magical powers, thanks to the hints dropped by Mr. Freeman's Geel Piet, a bald, barefoot prisoner with a disconcertingly servile manner (he refers to P. K. as ""Little Boss""). Mr. Freeman's humanity and intelligence are unmistakable, as always, but not even he can rise above the wretchedness of this role. When Geel Piet is forced to eat excrement by a white prison guard, the camera zeroes in for yet another close-up image of humiliation.""The Power of One,"" with a screenplay by Robert Mark Kamen based on Bryce Courtenay's novel, must surely be less obvious on the page than it is on screen. The film is often regrettably blunt, as when the story's fascist Afrikaner villains literally drink a toast to apartheid, or when P. K.'s feeble Romeo-and-Juliet romance with the daughter (Fay Masterson) of this Afrikaner family is filmed as if it were ""Romeo and Juliet,"" balcony and all. The film's occasional jarring elements, like the presence of what looks like a nuclear power plant near a black township in the late 1940's, are a welcome diversion. The Power of OneDirected and edited by John G. Avildsen; screenplay by Robert Mark Kamen, based on a novel by Bryce Courtenay; director of photography, Dean Semler; music by Hans Zimmer; production designer, Roger Hall; produced by Arnon Milchan; released by Warner Brothers.

"Screen: 'Age of Medici,' Trilogy by Rossellini:First Family of Florence - The New York Times","should one wish it — to see the three films in a marathon (four hours and 12 minutes) screening, plus appropriate intermissions. The films are not difficult and certainly they are not ambiguous. However, their austere style, as well as Rossellini's total lack of concern for what might be called performance, take some getting used to. Yet once you've grasped the method and the rhythm of the films, they are a ravishingly beautiful experience that shouldn't be interrupted. More than ""Socrates"" and much more than ""The Rise of Louis XIV,"" the Medici films speak most eleoquently of what was on Rossellini's mind when he turned away from the commercial cinema to what he called, for lack of any suitable euphemism, teaching films. In his book, ""Un Esprit Libre,"" published in France the year he died, he devoted a chapter to what he saw as the need for ""an integral education,"" meaning a kind of continuing, all-round education by which modern man would be freed from the terrible dangers of specialization, which he saw as as another form of ignorance. ""We are neither ants, nor bees, nor spiders,"" he wrote, ""and yet we have become regimented, stereotyped. . . .""Rossellini's impatience with contemporary education was founded on his belief that most educational systems have the effect of ""fixing and maintaining"" what is already established in a society. He also found ridiculous educational methods that fill brains with facts while suffocating all interest into the why's of life and the world. In ""The Age of the Medici"" Rossellini documents the explosion in the sciences and the arts in the Renaissance under the influence of the Medicis, the quintessential bourgeois family whose banking and business interests shaped the economic, political and social life of what became the modern world. In these films we see Cosimo wheeling and dealing to bring an end to a costly and foolish war, not because of moral reasons but because war is bad for business. Cosimo is not above bribery, conspiracy and murder in what he deems the public interest, which is also his. When necessary, the church is available to sanctify skulduggery. The arts are patronized, the past is examined for what it can yield to the present, and an unbiased science is a universal discipline. Though the trilogy takes the name of the Medicis, Leon Battista Alberti is its most important figure. Alberti is the true Renaissance man, an architect, scholar, humanist, a fellow who never stopped seeking, inquiring, speculating, someone, clearly, whom Rossellini could identify with. The visual style of ""The Age of the Medici"" is modestly elegant. Shot in color and 16 millimeter, mostly in and around Florence, the films have a form dictated by their function, which is to tell us as much as possible, as efficiently as possible, about the life and thought of the times. The actors make few attempts to act. They recite as they walk about magnificent locations, sounding and looking like ferociously gifted dress-extras. The talk has been rather flatly dubbed into English so that it's not always possible to tell who is speaking. Forget these problems, though. The film is about what is being said and what you can see around and behind these figures. When you connect with ""The Age of the Medici,"" it has the effect of reducing every other film you've seen recently to the status of an ornament. First Family of FlorenceTHE AGE OF THE MEDICI (in three parts of 84 minutes each), directed by Roberto Rossellini; written by Mr. Rossellini, Luciano Scaffa and Marcella Mariani; photographed by Mario Montuori; edited by Jolanda Benvenuti; music by Manuel De Sica.

The Screen: 'Power Over Women':Tale of Love Explores Life of 'Right Guy' Rod Taylor Plays Role of Rock Singer - The New York Times,"he has only his income, his Jaguar, his principles, the occasional favors of at least three terrific girls, and the perfect mate for the mind and body in Carol White, who happens to be married to his best friend. Although it sounds pretty much like every third movie you've ever seen, ""The Man Who Had Power Over Women"" enjoys a small distinction in the wonderful ease with which it resolves each of its insurmountable problems. Thus, no sooner does the frigid wife ask Rod Taylor for a divorce (because he's so sexy, I think) than Carol White falls into bed with him. And no sooner does she fall than her husband and his buddy (James Booth — who, thank goodness, didn't love her anyway) is conveniently killed under a truckload of toilet bowls. Rod Taylor feels very sad, and he cries for his pal before running off with the widow — having meanwhile plugged the vile rock star in the jaw, to signify independence. No actor could survive this material, but Rod Taylor, whose face really looks like a fund of worldly trust, does pretty well. He is at his best in sexual comedy, with Alexandra Stewart and Magali Noel, and at his worst in sexual sentimentality with Miss White. But in this he follows the fortunes of the movie, which discovers a certain moral bankruptcy each time it pauses to take stock of itself.""The Man Who Had Power Over Women"" opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.

Screen: Love Conquers in 'Power and the Prize'; Big Business Succumbs in Drama at State Acting Is Impressive in a Rather Trite Story - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from September 27, 1956, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. WHAT should be a quite popular demonstration of true love conquering all, even the ruthless opposition of an American big-business tycoon, is literately and pleasingly presented in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's ""The Power and the Prize,"" a cupid-versus-corporation drama, which came to Loew's State yesterday. And the reasons why it should be popular are pretty well concentrated in the lovely person of Elisabeth Mueller, a German actress, in the role of the romantic prize. As a poor but honest refugee from Austria who captures the fancy and then the love of a sturdy young executive sent to London to do a big wrap-up job, Miss Mueller, whose physical appearance reminds us of Marsha Hunt, makes a whirlwind courtship by Robert Taylor not only charming but plausible. Furthermore, she makes the defiance that Mr. Taylor has to show toward his boss, who is dead set against the romance, emphatically logical. It is actually a somewhat hackneyed story that Robert Ardrey has pulled from a novel by Howard Swiggett in the contemporary ""flannel suit"" style. The uncontrolled outrage and vengeance of the big-daddy boss, Burl Ives, against the girl just because her suitor flubs the job he is sent to London to do are more a romantic convention than a credible show of power techniques. And the easy solution of the problem is a glib working toward a happy end. But Mr. Ardrey has written his screen play sleekly, with sharp and sophisticated words, and he has kept his business maneuvers within a clear and dramatic frame. The distinction between ruthless go-getting and respect for others' rights and dignity, which is what the executive learns in London, is fairly and simply made. And the current trick of using a ""Red"" label to smear somebody is frankly exposed. But what is most effective in this picture are Miss Mueller's cultivated charm, her exquisite nuances of expression and, indeed, the good acting of everyone. In addition to this handsome young lady, who shows a rare sensitivity, the entire cast creates fluid characters in an assortment of interesting roles. Mr. Ives is mammoth and morbific as the sort of business man who would believe, with absolute assurance, that what is good for Amalgamated Metals is good for its executives' wives. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is polished and prudent as an upright British business man, and Charles Coburn is briefly terrific as a veteran of the American corporate wars. Richard Erdman as a tagalong technician, Mary Astor as big-daddy's lonely wife and Nicola Michaels as an immature fiancéee are also impressively right. Even Mr. Taylor, who runs to statuary looks these days, is convincingly ardent and courageous as the temporarily diverted tycoon. Henry Koster has directed this picture crisply and composed it felicitously in Cinema-Scope black-and-white that is superfluous but appropriately reflective of the movie industry's own big ideas.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Told in a manner which is a distinct departure from the ordinary talking picture, there came to the screen of the Gaiety last night Jesse L. Lasky's latest production, ""The Power and the Glory,"" the story of the success and tragedy of two lives, a husband and a wife. It is a compelling and forceful film, thoroughly human and always believable. The new treatment, which the producer calls ""narratage,"" is eminently well suited to this particular dramatic vehicle. Although the story is told by a life-long friend of a dead man, the characters in most instances speak for themselves once an incident to which the friend refers appears on the screen. These episodes in the lives of Tom Garner and his wife, Sally, are not brought forth in a chronological order, but virtually in answer to accusations made by the wife of the narrator against Garner. The first shows Tom Garner as a boy at the old swimming hole, and the next depicts Garner urging the directors of the railroad of which he is president to put $9,000,000 into another line. A further incident is concerned with Tom and Sally when she is a school teacher. Other episodes are adroitly linked, sometimes first by showing what has happened to the couple and then what was anticipated by them. Notwithstanding the swaying from one period in the existence of the Garners to another, the interest is sustained in a masterly fashion. The opening scene depicts the funeral service for Tom Garner, and soon one beholds Henry, his friend, wandering away from the church, overcome by emotion. The unexpected happens many a time in the course of this film, for not everybody admires Tom Garner as Henry does. Henry's wife, to whom he tells the story of Garner, is one of those who condemn the dead president of the Chicago South Western Railway and Henry explains what actually happened, for, besides being brought up in the same hamlet with Garner, he worked as Garner's confidential secretary. Spencer Tracy appears as Garner and Colleen Moore portrays Sally. Ralph Morgan interprets the rôle of Henry. After having beheld Garner dominating the directors of the Chicago & South Western, one later perceives him in his early days as a track walker, who confesses to Sally that he cannot read or write. The scenes in which Tom goes for a walk up the foothill of a mountain, trying to muster up courage to propose to Sally, are set forth with a remarkable natural charm. It is not until he reaches the summit of the hill that he finally proposes and is at once accepted. This is one of the episodes which is told wholly by Henry, but the words he speaks for the characters synchronize with the lip movements of Tom and Sally. That Tom's success is due to Sally's persistence is admitted by Henry, for he tells how Sally persuades her husband to permit her to undertake the job of track-walking while he goes to learn about railroads and to night school. But as soon as Tom wins promotion he manifests a somewhat selfish interest in his own doings. When Sally is about to tell him that there is going to be an addition to the family, Tom is so elated over what has happened to him that he does not permit her to say a word. Finally, however, he is thoroughly sympathetic, especially when one perceives him as the anxious husband hoping it will be a boy. One of the conspicuously fine sequences is where Tom Garner goes to a meeting of striking railroad men and gives them a vehement but short talk, thoroughly subduing one striker who was boasting what he would do to Tom Garner if he appeared before him. Although Mr. Tracy's performance is flawless, this particular series of scenes gives him an excellent opportunity, of which he takes full advantage. Subsequently a young and good-looking woman enters into Garner's life and she is the cause of the tragic ending of the couple, first of Sally and a year or so later of Tom. Miss Moore, whose coiffure is quite different from what it was four years ago, gives a splendid performance as Sally. Mr. Morgan is rightly sympathetic and loyal as Henry. But it is Mr. Tracy who captures the histrionic honors. No little praise for the excellence of this film is due to William K. Howard for the direction and to Preston Sturges, who is responsible for the story and its development.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Equating imperious sexual cruelty with a totalitarian mind-set, Nicolas Roeg's film ""Two Deaths"" makes one of the riskiest comparisons that a serious movie could formulate between private behavior and public deportment. Yes, we know power corrupts, and we've all heard stories about pedophilic dictators and sadistic generalissimos. But how reasonable is it to assume that organized political oppression has its corollary in the imperial bedroom? This alternately talky and gory allegory about the fall of Communism and sexual power games makes a vivid if somewhat muddled argument for the existence of such a relationship. Set in a nameless city in a country that suggests Romania during the early days of perestroika, ""Two Deaths"" cuts back and forth between a violent revolution in the streets and an obscenely lavish dinner party given by a successful, politically well-connected surgeon named Daniel Pavenic (Michael Gambon). As this Mephistophelean bon vivant serves a banquet to three old school friends who have gathered for their annual reunion, the streets below his elegant house are raked with gunfire. Every so often the host excuses himself to go downstairs to attend to wounded policemen and soldiers from his security forces, then returns to the feast with an air of unruffled calm. As the evening unfolds, the fighting intensifies, and the conversation among the four becomes a high-flown, philosophical kind of locker-room confession about sexual obsession, power and betrayal. The revelations begin with a question from one of the guests. Who is the beautiful young mystery woman in a picture Daniel keeps on his mantelpiece? Daniel replies that it is a photograph taken many years ago of Ana Puscasu (Sonia Braga), the housekeeper who is serving the feast. And as this still-striking woman moves silently back and forth from the kitchen bearing one delicacy after another, Daniel regales his friends with the story of his lifelong obsession with her. His sad, appalling confession, told partly in flashbacks, is the story of a man who, upon finding himself unable to obtain her love, fiendishly contrives the means to possess her. If Allan Scott's screenplay doesn't succeed in making the details of his conquest literally believable, it is a forceful metaphor for the monstrous exercise of power to gratify an obsession. That obsession is grounded in a paradox that has political reverberations. As much as he can occupy her body, he can never win her love: she is simultaneously possessable and unattainable. Daniel's candor elicits similar confessions from two of his three guests. One (Nickolas Grace) craves physical humiliation at the hands of prostitutes. Another (Patrick Malahide) has pretended for years that the wife who betrayed him (in a meaningless one-night stand with Daniel) died in a skiing accident. Not since Roman Polanski's ""Bitter Moon"" has a film offered such a pessimistic, mean-spirited vision of sexual relations as a brutal go-for-broke power struggle in which there are only two roles: victim and tormentor. Where ""Bitter Moon"" was shot through with a dark, Freudian humor and the sense of its all being a nasty practical joke, ""Two Deaths,"" which opens today at the Quad Cinema, strains toward a heavy metaphorical resonance. In one scene, Daniel's pal Cinca, a high military official and admitted torturer, drops by long enough to share a chortling reminiscence of their innocent and virtuous youth. The cinematography pointedly compares the preparation of the banquet -- the cleaning of fish and the slicing of raw meat -- to the carnage in the streets. Portraying the central figures in this demonic dance, Mr. Gambon and Ms. Braga make arresting partners. Although the Brazilian actress doesn't have much to do other than serve food and glower ominously as her employer first verbally, then physically strips her bare, she stamps the film with a grave, pensive sensuality. In a role one can imagine George Sanders would have relished, Mr. Gambon plays Daniel with such a disarming lightness that he is charming, despite his actions. The complicated responses his performance evokes lend the film a moral complexity that prevents the central equation from seeming thuddingly glib. ""Two Deaths"" gives a new and ugly meaning to cliches exalting ""the power of love.""""Two Deaths"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity and some gory scenes of injured people.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Maurizio Nichetti, the director and star of the mildly funny and excruciatingly whimsical ""Stefano Quantestorie,"" should not be confused with Nanni Moretti, the director and star of the current ""Caro Diario,"" a far more sophisticated and droll film. Both have been compared, wrongheadedly, to Woody Allen, but a taste for one does not translate to the other. Mr. Nichetti, whose ""Stefano Quantestorie"" opens today at Film Forum, once studied as a mime. He has a tendency to cast himself in the role of a mournful clown, and to load his films with multiple, overlapping stories that sound cleverer than they are. In ""Stefano Quantestorie"" (""Stefano Many Stories""), Mr. Nichetti plays six roles. The central character is a policeman named Stefano. Visiting his parents, he encounters a woman working in a toy shop who, he believes, may be a robber the police are looking for. That is the plot from which the film leaps into five alternative stories that show how Stefano's life might have turned out differently. He might have been an airline pilot cheating on his wife with a stewardess. He might have been a math professor or even one of the robbers he is now pursuing. Each life is played out in flashback, interwoven with the story of Stefano the policeman. Mr. Nichetti's hair changes with each role, but his hapless character is essentially the same. Characters from one story reappear in others in ways that are meant to be funny but turn out to be predictable. Stefano the professor turns out to be the husband of the airline stewardess with whom Stefano the pilot is fooling around. The best surprise in the film is James Spencer Thierree, portraying Stefano as a young man who dreams of becoming a saxophone player. It would be easy to recognize Mr. Thierree as a gifted, graceful physical comedian even if he didn't bear a distinct resemblance to his grandfather Charlie Chaplin. In his silent role, he is a bumbler whose very clothes seem to be booby-trapped, and he offers a relief from the antic, ultimately tiresome stream of characters played by Mr. Nichetti.""Stefano Quantestorie"" is being shown with a deft and witty five-minute black-and-white film called ""Hung Up,"" directed by Pat Hartley. In this quintessential New York story, a young woman calling her boyfriend from a pay phone tries hard to maintain her sanity, and just as important, her sense of style, under crazy-making circumstances.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. TO CONCLUDE its minifestival of heretofore unreleased films by the great Luis Buñuel, the Renoir Cinema yesterday opened ""Death in the Garden"" (""La Mort en Ce Jardin""), a comparatively big-budget, color, Mexican-French co-production made in 1956. Like ""Fever Mounts at El Pao,"" a 1959 Mexican-French co-production that Buñuel himself would like to forget. ""Death in the Garden"" is full of marvelous, uniquely Buñuelian moments set in a melodramatic custard. It's not a film by which to be introduced to Buñuel, but if you know and appreciate his work as I do, it's one of the few movies around that should not be missed.""Death in the Garden,"" set in the backwaters and the jungles of an unidentified South American dictatorship, is a large-scale narrative that takes on state, church, the military, society and the individual in such a way that you feel the director must have intended this primeval locale to be a kind of psychological mirror-image of the Franco Spain from which he exiled himself. Though the film's intellectual substructure is fascinating, the screenplay (by Buñuel, Luis Alcoriza and Raymond Queneau) is so packed with incident that it's all that one can do to keep up with the plot, which is at war with reflection. Its principal characters are a beautiful hard-hearted whore (played by a very young Simone Signoret), a handsome, amoral young drifter (Georges Marchal), a well-meaning but ineffectual priest (Michel Piccoli, with all of his hair), an aging diamond miner (Charles Vanel) who dreams of opening a restaurant in Marseilles, and his pretty, mute daughter (Michele Girardon). Through one ruse and another, including a bloody but ineffectual rebellion, Buñuel and his collaborators put the characters into the position of having to flee for their lives upstream and into the jungles. Nobody in the small party of fugitives either lives or dies by accident. Their fates are decided by a scheme that invites interpretation more than surprise. It's not the story, the performances or even the ideas (much more wittily and succinctly put in both earlier and later Buñuel films), but the sudden moments in which a Buñuel image or gesture comes shining through a haze of melodramatic conventions. There's an extraordinary moment when the body of a headless python, killed by the fugitives for their supper, suddenly seems to come alive again as it is attacked by an army of ants. That one image could be one entire movie. In another scene, Mr. Piccoli, the priest, recalls for no easily apparent reason a story about a fellow seminarian who once had a compulsion to eat poached eggs. In moments like this, one glimpses Buñuel's appreciation for the act of disorder. At the time Buñuel made ""Death in the Garden"" he had already produced such masterpieces as ""Los Olvidados,"" ""El"" and ""The Criminal Life of Archibaldo de La Cruz,"" and he was within four years of beginning his golden age that includes ""Viridiana,"" ""Simon of the Desert,"" ""Belle de Jour,"" ""Tristana"" and ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.""""Death in the Garden"" is a kind of halfway house for the film genius, made when he had yet to receive the acclaim that would give him full control of his movies, but after he had been taken seriously enough by the money men to be entrusted with an expensive movie with big stars.""Death in the Garden"" is a perfectly honorable compromise, but you won't see in it the simplicity and the clarity of technique and spirit that are so breathtaking in his best movies. A word about the film as it's being shown at the Renoir: It's a 16-mm print in which the color is not first-rate and many of the white subtitles, especially at the beginning, are virtually invisible. Drama in AspicDEATH IN THE GARDEN (La Mort en Ce Jardin), directed by Luis Bunuel; screenplay (French with English subtitles) by Mr. Bunuel, Luis Alcoriza, Kaymond Queneau, based on a story by Jose-Andre Lacour; produced by David Mage and Oscar Dancigers; director of photography, Jorge Stahl Jr.; music, Paul Misraki; editor, Marguerite Renoir; a co-production of Producciones Teperac (Mexico) and Dismage (Paris).

"Review: In ‘Revenge,’ the Trophy Turns Hunter - The New York Times","a woman collecting payback from the men who have assaulted her — is not exactly new, and it’s a conceit that can be used as an alibi. The way a movie like this often goes is that the audience is invited to revel in the spectacle of sexual violence and also in the violent punishment that follows. Misogyny is indulged so it can be condemned, and vice versa. Coralie Fargeat, making an impressive, uncompromising feature-directing debut, sets out to avoid that trap, or at least to build a better one. “Revenge” begins at a high pitch of travel porn and commodity fetishism. A helicopter alights near a luxurious modernist villa in the desert (possibly in Mexico, though the end credits say Morocco), disgorging a guy (Kevin Janssens) with accessories that identify him as one of life’s winners: a chunky watch, a gym-carved physique and a young girlfriend (Matilda Lutz) who suggestively tongues a lollipop as she peeps through candy-colored sunglasses. Her name is Jen. Her companion, Richard, is married to someone else. He speaks French. She might be American. In any case, the camera observes her according to time-honored cinematic conventions: from behind at a low angle as she walks around in her underwear or a bathing suit. When Richard’s hunting buddies, Stan (Vincent Colombe) and Dimitri (Guillaume Bouchède), show up, they regard her in the same way. But everyone seems to be having a good time. The male gaze never hurt anyone, right? There’s a big TV, a good sound system, an infinity pool. Some guns, too, but those are for later. Things turn ugly pretty fast. The men reveal their true predatory colors. First Stan, who rapes Jen; then Dimitri, who ignores the assault; and finally Richard, who proves to be the worst bro in the bunch. There follows a long working out of the film’s title, as Jen transforms herself from victim to warrior and Ms. Fargeat turns her skills to suspense and gore. There is a lot of that, as male flesh is mangled by bullets, blades and broken glass. Some of this is played for gruesome comedy, especially in the extended climactic showdown. Realism is not much of a concern. Jen’s survival, while neither supernatural nor superhuman, nonetheless grants her a quasi-mythic status. Gravely wounded, she heals herself with some peyote, a cigarette lighter, a hunting knife and an empty beer can. The logo leaves a symbolic tattoo across her abdomen. And “Revenge” leaves a lurid, punchy afterimage, an impression somewhere between righteous delight and quivering revulsion. It’s both a challenge and a calling card, in which Ms. Fargeat at once exposes what’s wrong with her chosen genre and demonstrates her mastery of it.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/movies/revenge-review.html
"Review: In ‘Rings,’ Best Not Go to the Videotape - The New York Times","the demographic being aimed at here — will learn an important lesson: Beware of any professor who tries to recruit you for a research study. In case you’ve forgotten, the foundation of the franchise is a short videotape full of unsettling images that unsuspecting people keep stumbling upon; anyone who watches it dies seven days later. The original Japanese film, by Hideo Nakata, was an influential hit, and the 2002 American version was pretty successful, too, boosting the career of its star, Naomi Watts. (“The Ring Two,” in 2005, didn’t do as well.)There is no Ms. Watts in “Rings,” directed efficiently by F. Javier Gutiérrez, but there is a heroine in jeopardy, Julia, played by Matilda Lutz. Julia’s boyfriend, Holt (Alex Roe), has gone off to college and been sucked into a research project by Gabriel (Johnny Galecki, of “The Big Bang Theory”), a professor who accidentally acquired the lethal videotape at a flea market. Gabriel has realized that the curse can be beaten if, during the seven-day period, the afflicted person gets someone else to watch the tape, and so his research is predicated on a sort of lethal pyramid scheme. Julia is determined to rescue Holt at any cost; Vincent D’Onofrio makes an embarrassing appearance as a blind cemetery caretaker; and Samara (Bonnie Morgan) is given a full back story. The death-by-VCR conceit has been pretty thoroughly exhausted at this point, imitation being the sincerest form of flattery — see, for instance, “Beyond the Gates,” which came out in December. So this film doesn’t find any fresh ways to make you jump out of your seat. Ms. Lutz is appealing, though, and fans of the franchise will probably be pleased with the elaboration. Too many horror sequels are content merely to recycle what worked the first time.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/movies/rings-review.html

Danny DeVito can certainly be forgiven for stealing his own movie, since he does it in such jaunty high style. United in wretched fashion excess and happy connubial malice, Mr. DeVito and his wife, Rhea Perlman, play Harry and Zinnia Wormwood, the rotten parents of Roald Dahl's smart and solitary little heroine. Like any young Dahl protagonist, she must defend herself from the evils of a cruel, patently ridiculous adult world. In the manner of his earlier ''Throw Momma From the Train'' and ''The War of the Roses,'' Mr. DeVito brings out the merrily black comedy in such a battle. From Day One (Mr. DeVito is seen glaring at a baby in a hospital nursery), the solemn and precocious Matilda (Mara Wilson) is automatically loathed by parents who resent her exotic tastes. Like reading. It infuriates them when she brings home ''Pickwick Papers'' and ''Lorna Doone'' in her little red wagon after a trip to the library. They don't even want her to go to school. ''It's out of the question,'' Harry says. ''Who would be here to sign for the packages?''So Matilda is left home alone while her parents pursue their own interests, like accumulating baubles (the loud costumes and production design are cartoonishly hilarious) and swindling customers at Harry's used-car dealership. When they do come home and finish primping, they berate Matilda for not spending more time the way they do, parked in front of the television set. ''You're a Wormwood; you start acting like one!'' Harry cautions his daughter. He adds: ''There's nothing you can get from a book that you can't get from television faster.''As adapted skillfully by Nicholas Kazan and Robin Swicord, with fondness for Mr. Dahl's literary outlook and blistering invective, ''Matilda'' now revels in gaudy Americana. But its English roots show more in the film's second half, when Matilda is sent to school under the tutelage of evil Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris), a monstrous, Army-booted harridan whom one student mistakenly refers to as ''Sir.''As testament to the staggering Dahl misogyny, Miss Trunchbull sadistically torments her students (a particularly adorable band of young players) and even throws children out of windows. Mr. DeVito directs this to look as far-fetched as possible, but this otherwise ebullient film dwells at uncomfortable length on Miss Trunchbull's nastiness. The other side of the coin comes, rather wanly, from the teacher named Miss Honey, played by Embeth Davidtz as a bland embodiment of her name. As the battle for Matilda is played out by these two women during the second part of the film, the senior Wormwoods recede from the story. That robs the film of some of its fun. But Harry and Zinnia are still available to be on the receiving end of the vengeful practical jokes that signal Matilda's new freedom. Twisted enough by Mr. Dahl and given a jolt of caricature by Mr. DeVito, ''Matilda'' makes too perverse a tale for very young children. That's been true of every Dahl book (like ''The Witches'' and ''James and the Giant Peach'') to reach the screen. But this one has playful flamboyance and a dark verve that older children should appreciate. And it has a sweet, self-possessed little heroine. Even when addressed by her father as ''You lyin' little earwig,'' Ms. Wilson's poised Matilda never loses the quiet confidence that guarantees she will prevail. Also in ''Matilda,'' creating headaches for the Wormwoods as a snoopy F. B. I. agent, is Paul Reubens, a k a Pee-wee Herman. The whimsical, cheerfully lunatic ambiance of this ''Matilda'' isn't all that far from Pee-wee's world.''Matilda'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity, jokey violence and fairy-tale sadism directed against children.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""MATILDA,"" which opens today at Radio City Music Hall, is a comedy about a male kangaroo named Matilda who is the chief contender for the heavyweight boxing championship of the world. The cast is headed by Elliott Gould, as the vaudeville promoter who gives Matilda his start; Clive Revill, as a former British flyweight boxer who owns Matilda and loves him like a son, and Robert Mitchum, as a sports columnist who manipulates the news he covers and, at the end, becomes the managing editor of the New York Post. According to the film's production notes, the role of Matilda is played both by a kangaoo named Whammo and by someone named Gary Morgan in a kangaroo suit that reportedly cost $30,000 but fits as if it had been ordered by seamail from Hong Kong. Matilda looks like the neighborhood practical joker on his way to a costume party, so I assume that it's Mr. Morgan we see on the screen most of the time. Paul Gallico wrote the novel on which Albert S. Ruddy and Timothy Galfas based their screenplay, which was directed by Daniel Mann with a total lack of spontaneity and with the groveling desire to please you might associate with a door-to-door salesman. The movie is chock-a-block with un-comic jokes and facetious inspirations, including Lionel Stander as a short-tempered boxing promoter, and several scenes showing two inept Mafia ""soldiers"" trying to kidnap Matilda and then to cut off his tail. Harry Guardino, a good actor, plays the Mafia chief with no great charm. Mr. Mitchum sort of lazes his way through the movie, knowing that he's bigger than it is. Mr. Gould seems to want to disassociate himself from the picture by watching the other actors as if astonished by the fools they are making of themselves. He's right, of course, but since he's in the movie, he looks a bit foolish, too. Mr. Revill, another able actor, plays Matilda's owner in a manner that recalls David Wayne's leprechaun period, which may not be something that all of us want to recall at this very minute.""Matilda"" is a movie that's in even worse shape than the Music Hall.

‘Black Box’ Review: Memory and Loss - The New York Times,"at least at first — by Phylicia Rashad, who honed that performance mode on “The Cosby Show” many years back. With the movie’s title technology and more, she creates a mental “safe room” for Nolan in which he can uncover memories. Which he does. Except they may not be his. And they’re not pleasant. They’re also interrupted by a figure walking backward on his feet and hands coming to beat up on Nolan. This feature directing debut from Emmanuel Osei-Kuffour Jr. has some presentation features that suggest a calling card for the mainstream (whatever that is nowadays), a crystal-clear narrative through-line, a conventionally supportive music score by Brandon Roberts among them. But it also brings some devilish ingenuity to its variations on “Memento” and other “who am I?” thrillers. And it adds to that something more rare: a genuine emotional potency. Black BoxNot rated.

‘The Social Dilemma’ Review: Unplug and Run - The New York Times,"Dr. Frankenstein, the scientist who went too far — for the digital age. In briskly edited interviews, Orlowski speaks with men and (a few) women who helped build social media and now fear the effects of their creations on users’ mental health and the foundations of democracy. They deliver their cautionary testimonies with the force of a start-up pitch, employing crisp aphorisms and pithy analogies. “Never before in history have 50 designers made decisions that would have an impact on two billion people,” says Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google. Anna Lembke, an addiction expert at Stanford University, explains that these companies exploit the brain’s evolutionary need for interpersonal connection. And Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook, delivers a chilling allegation: Russia didn’t hack Facebook; it simply used the platform. Much of this is familiar, but “The Social Dilemma” goes the extra explainer-mile by interspersing the interviews with P. S. A.-style fictional scenes of a suburban family suffering the consequences of social-media addiction. There are silent dinners, a pubescent daughter (Sophia Hammons) with self-image issues and a teenage son (Skyler Gisondo) who’s radicalized by YouTube recommendations promoting a vague ideology. This fictionalized narrative exemplifies the limitations of the documentary’s sometimes hyperbolic emphasis on the medium at the expense of the message. For instance, the movie’s interlocutors pin an increase in mental illness on social media usage yet don’t acknowledge factors like a rise in economic insecurity. Polarization, riots and protests are presented as particular symptoms of the social-media era without historical context. Despite their vehement criticisms, the interviewees in “The Social Dilemma” are not all doomsayers; many suggest that with the right changes, we can salvage the good of social media without the bad. But the grab bag of personal and political solutions they present in the film confuses two distinct targets of critique: the technology that causes destructive behaviors and the culture of unchecked capitalism that produces it. Nevertheless, “The Social Dilemma” is remarkably effective in sounding the alarm about the incursion of data mining and manipulative technology into our social lives and beyond. Orlowski’s film is itself not spared by the phenomenon it scrutinizes. The movie is streaming on Netflix, where it’ll become another node in the service’s data-based algorithm. The Social DilemmaRated PG-13 for dystopian speculation and some graphic images of violence. Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes.

‘Host’ Review: A Zoom Séance Channels Spirits and Melancholy - The New York Times,"If the future of filmmaking is remote and socially distanced, a Zoom séance isn’t such a bad place to start. Rob Savage, the director and co-writer of “Host,” finds a surprising amount of ingenuity in mining the horror of yet another quarantine conference call. Streaming on Shudder, the film makes easy observations about how the pandemic has changed the most mundane activities, but perhaps contains even greater insight. As Haley (Haley Bishop) gathers a group of friends to speak with a medium (Seylan Baxter), the unleashing of an angry demon seems to speak to a collective id. Savage makes common Zoom call interruptions, like strange noises and glitchy video, play double duty as both red herrings and supernatural disturbances. But while the unhappy ghost wreaks havoc, the yearning for collective activity simmers beneath the film’s lo-fi aesthetic. Channeling the spirits of the dead, on the internet no less, becomes a useful analogy for mourning the recent past. As we sit at home with the devices that promised us limitless possibilities in our hands, “Host” identifies the uncomfortable in-between state we exist in, operating ghostlike. One can relate to the fury the poltergeist unleashes, thrashing apartment objects about. Though not as dynamic as “Unfriended,” another “desktop movie,” “Host” observes uncannily the supernatural, ephemeral, and material worlds colliding together, gesturing toward an uncertain future. This concise, entertaining spin on the ghost story proposes that maybe the modern world is a haunted house now. HostNot rated. Running time: 56 minutes.

"‘Summerland’ Review: A Writer’s Life, Past and Present - The New York Times","the film pointedly stresses — deeply dislikes children. She’s not at all happy, then, to be lumbered with Frank (Lucas Bond), a sweet-natured schoolboy evacuated from London. I think we can all see where this is going. Getting there, though, will require frustratingly timid flashbacks to an interracial, same-sex relationship (featuring a woefully underemployed Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and airy-fairy conversations on the cultural mythologies that Alice studies. These fancies, and their role in building a bridge between Alice and Frank, are far more central to the child-friendly narrative than either forbidden love or the gender stereotyping rejected by Frank’s pal, Edie (Dixie Egerickx), a spiky tomboy. “I’m a maverick,” Edie explains; but Swale is too busy wholesomely sewing up every problem to care. Warm and soft and benignly manipulative — the movie’s sole death is scandalously opportune — “Summerland” brims with genteel sentiment and British briskness. Arterton is a wonderful actor, when not constrained by picture-book settings and prickly-spinster clichés. And an ending so contrived it will blow your mind.

‘How to Build a Girl’ Review: Write On - The New York Times,"crucially — a vocabulary. She’ll need all three when she wins a contest to write for a rock magazine (despite knowing little about music beyond the “Annie” soundtrack), rechristens herself Dolly Wilde and briefly soars before falling flat on her face. Picking herself up and dusting herself off becomes something of a habit as Dolly is humiliated by her male colleagues — entitled snobs who view her as an amusing curiosity — and rejected by her first crush. In response, her prose swerves from starry-eyed to snarky (she describes one band’s music as “ear cystitis”) and her journalistic stock climbs. Like a stone skipping on water, “How to Build a Girl” leaps from raunchy to charming, vulgar to sweet, earthy to airy-fairy without allowing any one to settle. Yet it’s so wonderfully funny and deeply embedded in class-consciousness — “We must never forget it’s a miracle when anyone gets anywhere from a bad postcode,” says one character — that its tonal incontinence is easily forgiven.

‘Intrigo: Dear Agnes’ Review: Please Kill My Husband - The New York Times,"In Alfred Hitchcock’s “Strangers on a Train,” an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel of the same name, two men meet by chance and discuss an exchange of murders: They would kill each other’s targets and evade suspicion because there would be no link between killer and victim. In the second entry of Daniel Alfredson’s thematic “Intrigo” trilogy, from a book by the Swedish author Hakan Nesser, the friends refer to this Hitchcock movie while hatching their own plan, inviting not only an unfair cinematic comparison to a masterpiece, but also scrutiny over a simple but flawed plot. “Intrigo: Dear Agnes,” now out on digital and on demand, features not strangers with homicidal schemes, but long-lost friends. Henny (Gemma Chan) reunites with Agnes (Carla Juri) after the funeral of the latter’s husband. Trapped in an unhappy marriage with a rich man, Henny expresses open envy at Agnes’s freedom. Henny realizes she can eliminate her husband, Peter, if she can persuade Agnes to kill him. In exchange, she’ll pay Agnes the money she needs to keep her house. Henny’s rationale is that she suspects Peter of infidelity, and Agnes gives voice to a question sure to occur to viewers: Why not just leave him? Henny doesn’t want to give him the satisfaction, she says. Through flashbacks, the film traces the falling out that led to the women’s current iciness. Their own connections, revealed bit by bit, make their plan even more ludicrous. A plot turn helps clarify why Henny reaches out to Agnes, but their motives remain muddled.

"‘Our Mothers’ Review: Uncovering Atrocities in Guatemala, Bone by Bone - The New York Times","one who is working on a project that goes back decades rather than centuries, which is usually what we see in movies featuring anthropologists. The movie opens with Ernesto, the young anthropologist (Armando Espitia), in a dimly-lit room, one you might see in a lab or a morgue, laying out bones on a table until a human skeleton takes shape. Díaz shoots and edits this process to put across a sense of quietude and patience, emphasizing process. Ernesto is part of a team investigating massacres from the 1980s, amid Guatemala’s long civil war. The movie is set in 2018, when the perpetrators of such atrocities were being brought to account for their actions. Ernesto is not just looking for justice, he’s trying to find the father he believes was a guerrilla and a victim of a mass killing in a village. In one scene, a few of the characters watch a television documentary in which a narrator notes, “Military command regarded the whole population as the enemy.” Men were killed, women were imprisoned, subjugated and raped, and now the killing fields are mass graveyards, each one a place where Ernesto’s investigative team must acquire discrete permission to dig up. “If you cannot separate your life from your work, we cannot keep you here,” one of Ernesto’s supervisors warns after the anthropologist’s intrusive questioning of one older woman. Because it was often only the women who were left alive in these villages, Ernesto and his team must rely on their often reluctant testimony. His own tunnel vision doesn’t quite blind him to their continuing courage, but it does lead him to construct a narrative that will unravel by the movie’s end. In the meantime, Ernesto’s mother (Emma Dib), who seems of two minds about her son’s quest, is preparing to testify before a tribunal. Her friends and comrades are intellectuals who still like to sing “The Internationale” at gatherings. There’s a strong sense that such activities are akin to whistling in the dark. The ambivalent, uncertain present of the movie can’t separate itself from the legacy of death that Ernesto and his colleagues keep uncovering. Díaz’s approach is plain and solid, like a well-built wooden chair before varnishing. The revelations of the story are often ghastly, but “Our Mothers” doesn’t go for the emotional jugular. Near the end there’s a montage of the faces of many poor women; most of them are on the precipice dividing middle and old age but they all look practically eternal in the way their features express, without trying, vast reservoirs of pain and fortitude. Díaz presents them, and leaves the rest in the laps of the viewers. Their moment in world history may be, as far as some are concerned, past. But the implicit question here is still pertinent: Which side are you on?Our MothersNot rated. In Spanish, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 18 minutes.

"‘Emma’ Review: Back on the Manor, but Still Clueless - The New York Times","the pea greens and dusky pinks, the comic looks and misunderstandings — has been emphatically embellished, so much so that it initially seems that de Wilde has adapted the material using Wes Anderson software. This approach takes getting used to and your mileage may vary; much depends on your tolerance for archness, twee and lightly deployed Anderson-ish tics. Certainly the opening scenes are less than promising, what with their fussy symmetry, popping colors and absence of shadows as well as flashes of unappealing, poorly processed visuals. Yet when Emma begins swanning around some blooms while imperiously instructing a maid about which flower to cut, the scene economically summons up a world and an attitude of careless, unconscious privilege. Taylor-Joy affects an appropriate hauteur, though one that, alas, too often solidifies into masklike blankness. This is a somewhat harsh, unappealing introduction to the character, whom Austen describes as “handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition.” At 21, Emma lives with her father (Bill Nighy, reliably amusing) in a large country estate 16 miles from London. As in the novel, the movie opens just as her longtime companion, Miss Taylor (the invaluable Gemma Whelan), marries, leaving Emma alone and prey to her worst, most meddlesome habits, particularly when it comes to other people. She’s blissfully unaware of her failings, accustomed to having her way with, Austen writes, “a disposition to think a little too well of herself.” Written by the novelist Eleanor Catton (“The Luminaries”), this “Emma” follows Austen’s story in its sweep and to that end involves its heroine’s dogged, often humorously ill-conceived efforts to make a match for her poor friend, Harriet (the affecting Mia Goth). Harriet lives in a school whose red-coated denizens can be seen trudging around as meticulously arranged as the girls in the children’s book “Madeline” (or the titular servants in “The Handmaid’s Tale”). In Harriet, Emma sees a self-flattering project, someone whose life she can improve with better society and the right suitor. In this material, de Wilde clearly sees an opportunity for heightened expressionism. The story’s comedy — and its narrative boldness — comes from the often absurd, yawning chasm between what Emma thinks she knows (and she believes she knows all) and what she so profoundly doesn’t understand, including the hearts of the people in her orbit. These include a dull clergyman (Josh O’Connor) and an enigmatic interloper (Callum Turner), both of whom Emma tries to steer toward Harriet. And then there’s the dashing heartthrob, Mr. Knightley (Johnny Flynn, very good), a wealthy friend of the family who, soon after galloping into the story, has stripped down naked in his bedroom, an entrance that immediately tips the role he plays in this game. As Emma’s plans stutter forward and amusingly slip off course, the filmmakers’ mild interventions feel less forced, more organic; even a seductive dance and an importunate nosebleed end up working nicely. Austen’s story and words, it turns out, prove unsurprisingly durable and impervious to decorative tweaking. And so, after a while, the Anderson-ish tics become less noticeable, and both the emotions and overall movie more persuasive. Much of this has to do with the pleasure of watching people fall on their faces — and in love — and with the suppleness of the largely note-perfect cast. Together, they deepen the feelings that swirl around a woman who with a sharp tongue and a vast imagination invents her world amusingly, foolishly, enduringly. EmmaRated PG for discreet nudity.

‘Little Women’ Review: This Movie Is Big - The New York Times,"when so much of humanity has earned Krampus or coal — the new movie version of Louisa May Alcott’s novel comes as an absolute gift. A whole stocking full, really. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, this “Little Women” — the latest of many adaptations — embraces its source material with eager enthusiasm rather than timid reverence. It is faithful enough to satisfy the book’s passionate devotees, who will recognize the work of a kindred spirit, while standing on its own as an independent and inventive piece of contemporary popular culture. Without resorting to self-conscious anachronism or fussy antiquarianism, Gerwig has fashioned a story that feels at once entirely true to its 19th-century origins and utterly modern. Some of that freshness comes from the cast, a cornucopia of effervescent young talent ballasted by a handful of doughty old-timers. There is also an exuberance — an appetite for clothes, books, baked goods and adventure — that effortlessly links then to now. At the center of the hullabaloo, as she was in Gerwig’s “Lady Bird,” is Saoirse Ronan. She plays Jo March, the second oldest of four sisters living in Concord, Mass., during and after the Civil War. The foursome varies by temperament and talent, inviting a mix-and-match game of identification and infatuation. The oldest, Meg (Emma Watson) is theatrical and responsible; Beth (Eliza Scanlen) is musical and sweet. The youngest sister, Amy (Florence Pugh), and Jo are a painter and a writer who are frequently at odds. Before romance, tragedy and the ordinary pains of growing up complicate matters, they are an inseparable if not always harmonious troupe. Jo writes the plays that the rest of them perform for an audience that includes various toys, their mother (Laura Dern) and Hannah (Jayne Houdyshell), the housekeeper. But the sisters live mainly to delight (and sometimes to torment) one another. The spectacle of their natural, affectionate, clamorous intimacy is a joy to behold, one we occasionally glimpse through the amused eyes of potential suitors, fond neighbors and a prodigiously judgmental and very wealthy aunt played by Meryl Streep. The girls’ nonjudgmental, non-wealthy father is played by Bob Odenkirk. Rather than starting where Alcott does, during an austere wartime Christmas, Gerwig introduces us to Jo seven years later, an ink-stained scribbler paying a visit to a New York publisher (Tracy Letts). The rest of “Little Women” zigzags between two periods in the lives of Jo and her family. Whereas Alcott traces their fates in a straight line, Gerwig (aided by the deft editing of Nick Houy and the musical stitching of Alexandre Desplat’s score) proceeds by association and recollection. It’s as if the book has been carefully cut apart and reassembled, its signatures sewn back together in an order that produces sparks of surprise and occasional bouts of pleasurable dizziness. This chronological shuffling jolts the story awake and nudges the viewer to pay close attention. Like any good novelist and every great filmmaker, Gerwig isn’t afraid to let her audience work a little. She trusts our intelligence and our curiosity, and also her own command of the medium. Reshuffling the plot is a way of making “Little Women” more cinematic without resorting to tricks or gimmicks. As much as “The Irishman” or “Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood,” this is a film that tackles the mysteries of time. In Gerwig’s hands, the specific magic of the medium — its ability to reorder the sequence of events, to slow down and speed up, to project memory ahead of experience — becomes a tool of philosophical and emotional inquiry. We observe the March sisters becoming who we have always known them to be, and also figuring out, for themselves, who they are. Their simultaneous comings-of-age take place amid the constraints and opportunities of their time, place, class and gender. The publisher who buys Jo’s sensational tales instructs her that women in fiction must wind up either married or dead, and “Little Women” the movie obeys that imperative, though not in quite the same way that “Little Women” the novel does. Romance arrives in the person of young Teddy Laurence (Timothée Chalamet), the slightly dissolute grandson of a wealthy Concord widower (Chris Cooper). Laurie, as the sisters call him, seems at times more like a fifth March sister or an untrained puppy than like boyfriend material. He can’t even sit properly in a chair!Meg, by consensus the prettiest of the four, falls for Laurie’s tutor (James Norton), which means that her wedding vow is also a vow of poverty. The more practical-minded Amy, counseled by Aunt March, grasps the economic implications of marriage. Jo, who catches the eye of both Laurie and a certain Professor Bhaer (Louis Garrel), might prefer not to marry at all. The question of freedom — in particular of a woman’s independence in a society that is both liberal and governed by tradition — is threaded through nearly every scene. “I’ve been angry every day of my life,” Mrs. March says matter-of-factly, and while “Little Women” is full of silliness and sorrow, sweetness and warmth, it doesn’t minimize or apologize for that anger. Nor does it mock or marginalize the March family’s commitment to social justice, civic responsibility and artistic excellence. All of those were, for Alcott, part of the mainstream of American culture. Gerwig knows that they still are. And so is this kind of entertainment: generous, sincere, full of critical intelligence and honest sentiment, self-aware without the slightest hint of cynicism, grounded in the particulars of life and accessible to everyone. Don’t let the diminutive title fool you. “Little Women” is major. It seems fitting to finish with Alcott’s last sentence: “I can never wish you a greater happiness than this!”Little WomenRated PG.

‘My Friend the Polish Girl’ Review: The Outsider - The New York Times,"Filmmakers who swing for the fences are inherently more interesting than those who play it safe. And no one can accuse Ewa Banaskiewicz and Mateusz Dymek, the writers and directors of “My Friend the Polish Girl,” of embracing safety in their singular, if somewhat forced attempt to query society’s callous treatment of immigrants. Set in post-Brexit London and framed as the debut documentary of an American filmmaker named Katie (Emma Friedman-Cohen), this bold experiment turns its faux-factual setup into a web of competing goals and ethically suspect behaviors. Katie, needing a vulnerable subject (“Someone hurt,” she explains), chooses Alicja (a fearless, haunting performance by Aneta Piotrowska). An aspiring and troubled Polish actress, Alicja is lonely and charismatic, estranged from her family and struggling to connect with someone beyond her many Facebook friends. Yet as Katie shadows Alicja around her neighborhood and to auditions, their relationship takes on a darkly controlling hue. Shot mostly in black and white and with an improvisational feel, “My Friend the Polish Girl” is cool and clever, feigning social realism with winking calculation. Casting two leads with physical similarities, then giving them common psychological sore spots, adds disturbing layers of emotional complexity. Whether provoking Alicja’s highly sexualized behavior or facilitating her career, Katie is slowly nudging her film from a study of exploitation to an example of the same. “Do you even like me?,” Alicja asks Katie near the end, and it’s telling that we really don’t know the answer.

"‘Last Christmas’ Review: Ho, Ho, Humbug - The New York Times","and what constitutes happily ever after — no longer apply. It was apparently so much easier for filmmakers when female happiness meant men, marriage and babymaking. That helps explain “Last Christmas,” a romantic comedy directed by Paul Feig that presents itself as a classic love story — boy meets girl — while busily rearranging its crucial bits. It does this with a big twist embedded in a lot of cutesy chatter, truckloads of plot, many feelings and even more life lessons. The twist is clever enough, though much depends on whether you see it coming. Whether you do or not (I didn’t), it is a steep price to pay for a movie that advocates tolerance, community and other virtues yet views its audience members as barbarians in need of regular schooling. That’s a drag because there’s some talent here, beginning with Emma Thompson, who has a showboating supporting role and shares script credit with Bryony Kimmings. Thompson is probably responsible for some of the snappier lines (that’s a reassuring fantasy, at least) and perhaps the sermonizing, too. But it’s hard to know who to blame for the forced and discordant scenes, or the mood-killing casting of Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding as the romantic leads. The actors look good together — never more so than on the movie’s poster — but her character’s strenuous perkiness and his character’s damp sincerity cancel each other out. Clarke plays Kate, a singer and aspiring musical performer living and scarcely struggling in London. She has a silly job in a Christmas shop where, dressed as an elf, she spars with the owner, a woman who calls herself Santa and is played by an agreeably astringent Michelle Yeoh. Clarke sparks off Yeoh (and Thompson) but they, alas, are not the romantic pair. Eventually Kate meets her designated one, Tom (Golding), a bland smiler who swoops in on a bicycle instead of a white horse and, despite a regular disappearing act, more or less serves a familiar princely function. Feig is an adroit director of comedy and he gives “Last Christmas” some fizz now and again. But he’s stymied by the romance and the gimmick, and the pairing of Clarke and Golding proves an impossible hurdle, making even the seemingly simplest moments — an intimate walk, a heartfelt talk — feel badly labored. After a while, particularly when Tom floats off, you start to wonder why the filmmakers even bothered with a romance, when all the best stuff, including at a homeless shelter, happens without Tom. Surely Kate, who seems to have so little going for her, except of course that she’s lovely, loved, talented and alive, could have learned all her lessons without such a dreary prop. Last ChristmasRated PG-13 for something, though it’s unclear what. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/movies/last-christmas-review.html
"‘Paradise Hills’ Review: Caged Birds Singing, Maybe Escaping - The New York Times","straw hats, cascading gowns, blank smiles — the inmates are pointedly dressed in girlish outfits, virginal white from their neck ruffs to their high-button boots. They sleep in identical beds in identical billowy nighties and wander around in dresses with Elizabethan-style bodices that flatten their breasts, as if to retard (and deny) their maturity and independence. Waddington appears to have drawn visual and narrative inspiration from a range of sources, with a tasty pinch of Lewis Carroll, an acid splash of Stanley Kubrick, a smattering of Giorgio de Chirico. The white costumes summon up “Picnic at Hanging Rock,” while the fastidiously manicured grounds bring to mind those in “Last Year at Marienbad.” Uma at times seems like an Alice in Un-wonderland, an intruder-inmate in a curiouser and curiouser realm. She meets friends — Danielle Macdonald, Awkwafina and Eiza González play other patients (detainees) — who come with their own teary tales. Together, the women bond and endure until something at last gives. Set in a vague future that’s clearly in the grip of the past, “Paradise Hills” is very much a movie about the present. At its center is the familiar fight over women’s bodies, a battle that seems already lost when the story opens. Despite Uma’s stated unhappiness, the hovering male guards and her attempts to push back, she never seems really alarmed enough. If anything, she can seem almost resigned, which indicates that the world beyond the island is more terrifying than suggested. At times, though, Uma’s lack of urgency feels more like an oversight, as if Waddington had spent so much time polishing the gears that she overlooked the machinery. Despite her shaky handle on the movie’s ideas and the appealing if uneven performances, Waddington holds your attention with visual beauty and humor. As the mood and tone darken, the narrative grows more baroque, creepier, and this speculative fiction turns into a freakout, or at least tries to. Alas, Roberts makes an unproductively wan center for this feminist allegory, which could have used more of the oomph that Awkwafina and Macdonald bring. A late revelation about less privileged women shows a thematic road not taken even as it suggests that Waddington may have more to say about women and their seemingly never-ending escape.

‘Late Night’ Review: Emma Thompson Takes On the Old Boys of Network TV - The New York Times,"a wholly fantastical creature. Not that this smart and breezy film, directed by Nisha Ganatra and written by Mindy Kaling, is especially implausible, other than in the usual charming, comedic ways. Kaling, for example, plays Molly Patel, who joins Katherine’s writing staff after working at a Pennsylvania chemical plant, a career transition explained with a pretty good throwaway joke. The movie’s overall picture of television, though, is drawn from life, and from Kaling’s long experience as a writer, producer and performer. What’s striking is that, in order to satirize the actual sexism of the industry, Kaling and Ganatra have had to imagine the TV world as just slightly less sexist than it may actually be. To put it another way, Katherine’s existence registers as a protest against the narrowness of American show business precisely because she’s such a vivid, complicated, believable person. You can easily fill in the arc of her career — a few fake-vintage video clips are provided to help with the effort — from the early ’90s until now. Thompson invites you to appreciate both Katherine’s seamless professionalism and the effort that goes into sustaining it, much as Garry Shandling did with Larry Sanders back when Katherine would have been in her prime. But now, as the events of “Late Night” unfold, that prime is fading. Honestly, whose isn’t? Nothing is what it used to be. The best lack all conviction, the worst are full of passionate intensity, what rough beast slouches — you know how it goes. (Though the Yeats poem quoted in the movie is a different one.) After nearly 30 years on the air, Katherine’s act has grown a little stale, to her viewers and herself. (Not Thompson’s, though. This is some of her very best work, which is saying a lot.)The network’s new boss (Amy Ryan) is looking for new blood. A youngish white guy (Ike Barinholtz) with an obnoxious anti-P. C. shtick is waiting in the wings to take over when Katherine is eased offstage. She still brings a brainy guest list and a brisk, skeptical British sensibility to her time slot, but whatever edge Katherine might once have possessed has been dulled — by success, by fatigue, by the illness of her husband (John Lithgow), by too long a soak in the lukewarm waters of the mainstream. “Late Night” happily splashes around in those same waters. Rather than scourging the complacency and hypocrisy of television, it subjects the medium to a vigorous exfoliating scrub in the name of feminism and inclusiveness. The humor, though sharp, is cruelty-free. The benefit of the doubt is extended even to the men who have benefited from the old-boy networking that has kept Katherine’s writing staff entirely white and male. They’re not bad guys, just beneficiaries of a rigged system. Kaling’s view of the landscape and its inhabitants — the imperious star, the neurotic writers, the beleaguered producer (Denis O’Hare) — is critical without cynicism or even much anger. The democratic, affirmative nature of television itself is what enables problems of access and representation to be solved. What’s needed, and what Katherine has lost, is faith. “I love television,” says Molly, and Kaling and Ganatra (whose many small-screen directing credits include “Transparent,” “Better Things” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”) clearly share that affection. The sincerity is disarming. It makes Katherine uncomfortable. You’d never hear Liz Lemon — or for that matter, Tina Fey — make such a declaration. Since the earliest days, the way to seem smart about television has usually been to act smarter than television, even when you’re on television. Molly, giddily happy about her job and earnestly committed to doing it well, refuses this attitude of superiority, and so does “Late Night.” Katherine, who reads jokes written by guys whose names she hasn’t bothered to learn, is the embodiment of legacy-media arrogance. She’s proudly clueless about the internet, and disdainful of newer forms of entertainment, especially those embraced by women. When she condescends to a young social-media influencer who has been booked on the show, the guest storms off, and the moment goes viral. The Twitter mob is not on Katherine’s side, and neither is the movie, which takes her humiliation as a teachable moment. Her feeling of superiority is a self-undermining defense against her own irrelevance. She has lost touch with the sources of her appeal, and needs to reconnect with the energy and vitality of the present, as well as with her own dormant feminist instincts. There are times when the movie loves TV so much that you get the feeling it would rather just be TV. A whole sitcom-season’s worth of story is shoehorned into less than two hours, as subplots and secondary characters that might have filled up half an episode are confined to a few swift beats. This is as much a compliment as a complaint, or at least a way of acknowledging the strength of the cast and the writing. But there’s a lot to keep track of. Molly’s battle of wills with one co-worker (Reid Scott) and her ill-advised romance with another (Hugh Dancy); Katherine’s marriage, her conflict with the network, her mental-health issues, her sex scandals. It all moves along at a snappy enough pace, but sometimes feels more facile than insightful. The insights are real, though, and the overall resistance to cliché is admirable. Every time you think “Late Night” is settling into familiar tropes — about workplace politics, mean bosses, long marriages, fish out of water, bootstraps and how to pull them — it shifts a few degrees and finds a fresh perspective. It argues that entertainment benefits from the presence of different faces and voices not by preaching but by example. And while you may or may not be persuaded by the thesis that it’s possible to be funny without being mean, in Katherine’s presence that question is moot. She’s something not many movie characters are allowed to be, at least not to this extent. She’s interesting. Late NightRated R. Standards and Practices.

‘Girls of the Sun’ Review: Brave Women Enlisted in a Battle Against Subtlety - The New York Times,"“Girls of the Sun,” Eva Husson’s ripped-from-real-life drama about a battalion of Kurdish women fighting the Islamic State in northern Iraq, begins and ends in the swirling dust of the same explosion. One survivor, a French journalist named Mathilde (Emmanuelle Bercot), becomes our guide and occasional narrator as she embeds with the unit and records the women’s stories. Sporting a black eye patch (reminiscent of the British war correspondent Marie Colvin), Mathilde bonds with Bahar (the arresting Golshifteh Farahani), the unit’s commander. She, like all the women, is an escaped ISIS captive who has suffered unspeakable abuse; now their mission is to liberate Bahar’s hometown, where her son remains a hostage. Their unique advantage is the jihadists’ belief that any fighter killed by a woman will be denied entry into heaven. Inspired by a 2014 ISIS raid on Kurdish territory, “Girls of the Sun,” unlike the women who populate it, is weak and often corny. The story is inherently dramatic and the action scenes (sinuously photographed by Mattias Troelstrup) have real punch, but Husson is more interested in exalting her subjects than humanizing them. Inelegant construction and unsubtle, occasionally tub-thumping dialogue further drain the movie’s potency, as do Mathilde’s overripe musings on war and suffering. The granddaughter of a onetime captive Spanish Republican soldier, Husson says in the press notes that she wanted to explore collective trauma and “the notion of lost ideals.” Her good intentions, though, are the movie’s kryptonite; and as we watch flashbacks to Bahar’s happy prewar life, we see the seeds of another, better movie. In Farahani’s gorgeously expressive, silent-film-star face lies the ability to convey more than any amount of journalistic eloquence.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/movies/girls-of-the-sun-review.html
‘The Wind’ Review: Who’s That Knocking at My Log Cabin Door? - The New York Times,"Two couples, two pregnancies and two dead bodies right up front make “The Wind,” Emma Tammi’s first narrative feature, a frontier ghost story with very human stakes. And maybe a very human explanation: Like Tommy Lee Jones’s marvelous 2014 Western, “The Homesman,” this pioneer chiller shines a gender-specific spotlight on the ways isolation and hardship can ravage a woman’s mind. The first time we see Lizzy (an intense Caitlin Gerard), she’s exiting her log cabin bearing a bloody bundle and wearing a traumatized expression. “How did she get my gun?” she asks her husband, Isaac (Ashley Zukerman), and their new neighbor, Gideon (Dylan McTee), whose erstwhile wife, Emma (Julia Goldani Telles), is about to follow her newborn into the ground. Frequent flashbacks show Emma’s gradual descent from emotional fragility to hallucinatory breakdown as a religious tract about demons becomes an obsession. Soon Lizzy, left alone while Isaac fetches supplies, is also beset by terrifying, shape-shifting apparitions. Their provenance and intentions are unclear, but Lizzy, a staunch German immigrant, isn’t about to give in to her fears. Atmospheric if narratively thin, “The Wind” (similarities to the 1928 silent film of the same name are coincidental) kicks up a competitive dynamic between the two women that further muddies the psychological waters. Teresa Sutherland’s nonlinear screenplay emphasizes the godlessness of the setting, while terse dialogue and a moaning, percussive sound design enhance its oppressive loneliness. The movie’s most striking aspect, though, is Lyn Moncrief’s arresting cinematography, which turns the vast vacancy of the plains into both hostile observer and hellish metaphor. The story might finally slip its leash, but the baleful mood holds firm.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/movies/the-wind-review.html
‘Parkland: Inside Building 12’ Review: Recounting the Attack in Painful Detail - The New York Times,"supplemented with floor plans of the building and phone footage from that day — makes the massacre immediate in a way that sometimes gets lost in news coverage or political debates. As you watch the teacher Ernie Rospierski say he’s been avoiding thinking about could-haves and should-haves or hear descriptions of how precariously positioned the student Maddy Wilford was after being shot, it’s impossible to avoid the sense that their survival came down to chance. These could easily be other shootings or other survivors. In fact, Minn has also made documentaries (presumably with the same approach) on the Pulse nightclub and Las Vegas shootings, and at times this hasty, low-budget production gives off an unfortunate air of ambulance chasing. Music cues provide unnecessary goosing; cheap re-enactments trace the shooter’s whereabouts; and the director, who is sometimes on camera, intersperses good questions with manipulative prods to his grieving subjects. But the subjects are there, and to the extent that “Parkland: Inside Building 12” is a memorial, not a documentary, it has a raw power.",http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/movies/parkland-inside-building-12-review.html
"‘Untogether’ Review: Adrift in Los Angeles, Looking for Love - The New York Times","As far as I can see, the main purpose of “Untogether” is to fetishize Jemima Kirke. Playing Andrea, a writer and barely clean heroin addict, Kirke is a Marilyn Monroe fantasy in vintage frocks and strawberry curls. Stripping, stretching, dancing and posing, she works the camera so assiduously that her latest sexual partner, Nick (Jamie Dornan), barely gets a look in. Not that Nick, an emotionally shuttered doctor with a successful memoir under his belt, would register any more forcefully were Andrea not perpetually wiggling between him and us. And he’s not alone in his lack of definition: there’s scarcely a behavior or line reading in this exasperating relationship drama that doesn’t feel like affectation. Fraudulence might be a plot point, but only the writer and director, Emma Forrest, knows why it has to permeate the entire movie. Defined by emotional damage in lieu of personalities, Andrea and her younger sister, Tara (played by Kirke’s real-life sister, Lola Kirke), bumble through separate romantic crises. While Andrea uses sex to coax love, Tara, an oversharing aesthetician, is pulling away from her middle-aged boyfriend (an underutilized Ben Mendelsohn) and toward a twinkling rabbi (Billy Crystal, if you can believe it). His civil rights-era stories and hip sermons (“Can Siri Google your soul?”) leave her breathless. Dreamily shot in Los Angeles by Autumn Durald Arkapaw, “Untogether” toys with themes of faith and self-knowledge.

‘The Favourite’ Review: Scheming for Power in a Kinky Palace Triangle - The New York Times,"affairs of state and of the flesh, both of which figure prominently here — were most often the stuff of tragedy. Lanthimos, a Greek director who has been based in London for the past few years, makes no real distinction between pathos and mirth. His first English-language film, “The Lobster,” was by turns ghastly and hilarious, a cruel dystopian allegory of discipline and desire. The next, “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” was mostly just ghastly. “The Favourite,” with a profane, erudite script by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, is a farce with teeth, a costume drama with sharp political instincts and an aggressive sense of the absurd. Anne’s court is populated by vain creatures in sky-high curly wigs and elaborately painted faces. Their pastimes include vicious sexual gossip, indoor duck racing and throwing rotten fruit at naked people. That accounts for the men, who also hold onto most of the power. Even with Anne (Olivia Colman) as head of state, patriarchy rules the realm, and women interested in power, autonomy or survival must navigate the hostile territory of male domination.[This film made our best movies of the year list. Read about our critics’ other picks.]This does not mean that the women are passive or innocent victims. On the contrary. The busy, buzzing plot of “The Favourite” is propelled by scheming, double-crossing and manipulation among its three main female characters. Anne, plagued by gout, grief and self-pity, functions as the hypotenuse of a discreet erotic and political triangle, the other legs of which are Abigail (Emma Stone) and Sarah (Rachel Weisz). Sarah, who has known the queen since they were children, is her lover as well as her adviser in governmental matters. An ally of the parliamentary leader (James Smith) and the wife of an important military commander (Mark Gatiss), she pushes for war with France and heavy taxes on landowners. Abigail, a cousin of Sarah’s, arrives at the palace covered in mud and full of ambition, and what follows can be partially described as a kinky, baroque variation on the themes of “All About Eve.” Abigail plays the role of wide-eyed ingénue, a masquerade that conceals formidable skills in psychological and physical combat. She cultivates an allegiance with the head of the opposition (Nicholas Hoult), a bond based on common interest and mutual disgust. Abigail fights dirty because a hard upbringing has taught her no fight is ever fair. Sarah accepts her as a protégée and is a bit too slow to recognize her as a rival. Their contest for Anne’s affection is thrilling and unnerving to witness, a full-body, full-dress chess match with no referee and ambiguous rules. The period details (the work of the production designer Fiona Crombie and the costume designer Sandy Powell, among others) provide more than decoration. They transport the viewer into a world where conventional distinctions — between private feeling and public display, between honesty and guile, between life and theater — do not apply. Everyone gambles with the unstable currencies of status and influence. Because so much depends on pomp and performance, on dignity and self-control, humiliation is an omnipresent peril and a popular sport. The most abject figure in this universe is the queen herself, whose illnesses, eccentricities and neuroses make her seem helpless and pathetic, easy prey for opportunists like Abigail and Sarah, who push her wheelchair and tend to her moods. But it’s also true that the queen is the only person in England capable of — or entitled to — sincerity. She alone is able to mean what she says and to get what she wants. Weisz and Stone are both brilliantly witty and nimble, but Colman’s performance is nothing short of sublime. She commits absolutely to Anne’s ridiculousness, and also to the contradictory facets of her humanity. The queen is imprisoned by grief, by tradition, by her own uncooperative body. She is also a free spirit. Lanthimos, his camera gliding through gilded corridors and down stone staircases — in exquisitely patterned light and shadow, with weird lenses and startling angles — choreographs an elaborate pageant of decorum and violence, claustrophobia and release. The law of the kingdom is mutability, signified by the many names its sovereign and her subjects are called by. Sarah is Lady Marlborough, and also Mrs. Freeman. The Queen is Mrs. Morley. Abigail plots to marry a handsome doofus (Joe Alwyn), hoping to acquire a title of her own. No identity or value is fixed. Alliances shift like the weather. Fortunes rise and fall. Beauty transmutes into ugliness and back again. Love is a synonym for domination, or maybe for submission. The best — and also the most troubling — thing about “The Favourite” is its rigorously bleak assessment of human motivations and behavior. The palace is a petri dish aswarm with familiar pathogens of egoism, cruelty and greed. A sentimental soul might wish for a glimpse of something else, but at the same time it’s hard to say that anything is missing from this tableau, which is also a devastating, flattering and strangely faithful mirror.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/movies/the-favourite-review.html

The encounter and the decision, and the asymmetries in the consequences for Adam (Fionn Whitehead, from “Dunkirk”) and Fiona, reverberate though the rest of the action. “The Children Act” makes for a more wieldy movie than this year’s earlier “On Chesil Beach,” which Mr. McEwan also adapted from his own book, in that case relying on retaining rhythms and chronological jumps better suited to the page. Here, a beautifully internalized performance from Ms. Thompson and the various efforts to highlight the cinematic potential in Fiona’s anguish — the climax plays out during a piano recital — can’t override the tidy ironies of Mr. McEwan’s design. Fiona is a custodian of children who has no children. She is a gifted listener, yet is too professional and emotionally guarded to truly hear what Adam has to say. And as Fiona’s husband (Stanley Tucci) puts it, in a blunt statement of themes, Fiona is an authority on family problems who neglects to address her own. Yet the movie finally punts on grappling with its ambiguities. The finale feels functional rather than haunting.",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/movies/the-children-act-review-emma-thompson.html

As sitcoms go, ''House Arrest,'' opening today, is more sit than com. Here's the situation. When Janet and Ned Beindorf shock their children on their 18th anniversary by announcing that they are planning to separate, the teen-age Grover and little Stacy respond by locking them in the basement, hoping they will come to their senses. To complicate matters, the shaken Grover (Kyle Howard) poignantly shares his troubles with his best friend, Matt Finley (Mooky Arizona), in the school lavatory, where they are overheard by the local bully, T. J. Krupp (Russel Harper). Soon the Beindorfs (Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Pollak) are joined in their unfinished basement by T. J.'s father (Christopher McDonald), a domineering lawyer, and mother (Sheila McCarthy), who dropped out of law school to wait tables so he could graduate. Matt contributes his much-married father (Wallace Shawn) and stepmother (Caroline Aaron), who seems to be nearing the end of her husband's customary two-year wife span. And, oh, yes, when Grover goes to the library to read up on pop psychology, he discovers that the seemingly unattainable girl of his dreams (Jennifer Love Hewitt) has a parental problem, too. Down to the basement goes her mom (Jennifer Tilly), who talks like a baby, dresses like a teen-ager and competes with her daughter. Pretty soon, ''House Arrest,'' written by Michael Hitchcock, begins to look like ''Home Alone'' turned on its head, with the parents trying to break out and the children using nail guns, metal bars, electric prods, threats about food and water and jury-rigged video surveillance to keep them in and monitor their group therapy. Across the street, the grumpy old retired police chief (Ray Walston) has suspicions that something is awry in the Beindorfs' American Dream house but no proof. And along with all the children (and their siblings) now inhabiting the Beindorf residence come a hefty dog and a boa constrictor. So what about comedy? The dog and boa jokes are obvious. The prison gimmicks soon grow repetitive. To the well-meaning Grover's dismay, the children promptly indulge in a food fight, but just when it seems that the angst-ridden youngsters are about to turn ''House Arrest'' into ''Oedipus Wrecks,'' the director, Harry Winer, returns the focus to their effort to induce the grown-ups to behave responsibly. The adults, naturally, are bickering among themselves and plotting to escape. But beyond Mrs. Beindorf's ascent past the rodents and through the cobwebs in a laundry chute, the film's creativity runs toward watching that nasty Mr. Krupp chip cement. The ending, of course, is never in doubt. Young Mr. Howard and Mr. Harper give appealing performances, and the adults play their roles like good sports. But once the situation is posited, ''House Arrest,'' wavering between doling out family values and pandering to adolescent anarchy, simply runs out of invention and into mediocrity.''House Arrest'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). The sudden announcement of marital separation may trouble some children more than the rodents and the snake.

If you have plans to undergo cosmetic surgery in the near future, Georges Franju's elegantly creepy ""Eyes Without a Face"" is a must to avoid. This 1959 French horror film, which is being revived at the Cinema Village in a new 35-millimeter print, follows the scalpel wielded by a mad plastic surgeon as he methodically slices off the face of a beautiful woman. Just when you hope that the camera will discreetly turn away from the procedure, it locks onto the eyes of a doomed medical captive as her skin is lifted off like a mask, soon to be grafted onto the face of another. It doesn't matter that the surgery looks fake by contemporary standards of film realism. The black-and-white movie, adapted from a novel by Jean Redon, sends a chill that extends from the cheekbones through the eye sockets to the back of the skull. Like other horror film classics, ""Eyes Without a Face"" succeeds by sustaining an atmosphere of sinister obsession. That mood is established in the opening scene when a handsome woman whose fixed glittering gaze matches her shiny black raincoat drives to the banks of the Seine in the middle of the night and dumps a body into the river. The driver, Louise (Alida Valli), is the fanatically loyal assistant to Professor Genessier (Pierre Brasseur), a medical researcher and plastic surgeon who carries out his experiments in a forbidding country mansion. The body belongs to the latest woman to die under his scalpel in a medical quest driven by a mixture of scientific hubris and guilt. Having been responsible for a car accident that disfigured the face of his beautiful daughter, Christiane (Edith Scob), the professor is determined to restore her beauty at any cost. Wearing a white mask and fluttering about the mansion like a distraught Ophelia, Christiane has begun to give up hope that her father can fulfill his promise to give her a new face. So far none of the skin grafts have taken. And she is horrified at the price of being his guinea pig.""Eyes Without a Face"" taps into our deepest childhood fears that doctors and nurses are evil strangers conspiring to keep us prisoners in a fiendish house of pain. And the professor's mansion, whose cellar is a kennel of caged howling dogs that he uses for his experiments, lives up to those fantasies. There are moments when ""Eyes Without a Face"" achieves a mixture of terror and desolation that recalls H. G. Wells's ultimate fable of torture in the name of demented science, ""The Island of Dr. Moreau.""THE EYES WITHOUT A FACE (LES YEUX SANS VISAGE)Directed by Georges Franju; written (in French, with English subtitles) by Boileau-Narcejac, Jean Redon and Claude Sautet, based on the novel ""Les Yeux Sans Visage"" by Mr. Redon; director of photography, Eugen Schuftan; edited by Gilbert Natot; music by Maurice Jarre; released by Interama.

Vampires aren't the only things in ''Bordello of Blood'' that can't stand up to daylight. Neither can the plot. In this generous helping of juvenile junk food being ladled out at theaters beginning today as the latest ''Tales From the Crypt'' presentation, the gory goings-on involve an unholy alliance between an evangelical television preacher and a horrendous vampire named Lilith. Lilith (played by Angie Everhart) is brought back to life when her quartered heart is reunited with her moldering corpse by a dwarf in a cave in Tierra del Fuego. Soon she has truly become a resident alien, running a brothel concealed in a sprawling old Deep South mansion that masquerades as a mortuary. Thanks to the deadly sins, Lilith is satisfying her lust for blood, and the preacher (played by Chris Sarandon), known to his friends as J. C., is satisfying his greed for money through the clients of this human version of a Roach Motel: they can enter, but they can't come out, at least not in the same form that they came in. Some are dead, and some, as they say in these movies, are the undead. All is going well with the tricks and their treats in this Halloween happy hooker house until Caleb Verdoux (Corey Feldman), the leather-clad, body-pierced, rock-and-roll-blasting brother of Katherine Verdoux (Erika Eleniak), the preacher's squeaky-clean, blond assistant, disappears one night. She turns to a seedy but intrepid investigator, Rafe Guttman (Dennis Miller), to find out why. By the time it's all over -- after the glimpses of bare bosoms and buttocks, the ravenous eyes, the bloody fangs, the glistening pulsating viscera, the ripped-off heads and the exploding, flaming, molten decomposing flesh -- ''Bordello of Blood'' really cannot bear much logical examination. But based on a story by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis (the ''Back to the Future'' team) and directed by Gilbert Adler from his screenplay with A. L. Katz, this not-so-grand guignol has something to commend it besides the toothsome women who play the vampires. It doesn't take itself seriously. It has a witty style (as when Lilith tempts Rafe by shape-shifting into a cheerleader, Marilyn Monroe in the famous white pleated dress and Katherine, or when the vampire prostitutes are done in by holy water shot from plastic toy pistols). And its humor is irreverent and up to the minute. Rafe, evidently an ''X-Files'' watcher, prepares Katherine for his theory about the goings-on in the mansion by saying, ''I'm going to advance a weird Duchovnian riff.''''Tales From the Crypt Presents Bordello of Blood'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity, bloody violence and the sort of language that is said to be unacceptable in the higher circles of society.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. Lotto Land,"" John Rubino's ode to a Brooklyn neighborhood, is a movie whose fondness for its characters makes up for some of its failures, but not enough for this no-budget film to hold together as more than a shaky exercise in good will. Shot in only 19 days in a working-class neighborhood at the fringe of Park Slope, the movie is a shambling pop-blues suite, in which a group of songs by the Holmes Brothers, a New York blues trio, is crudely woven through the film's two interlocking love stories. As agreeable as some of the music is, a score intended to comment on the drama and to fill in gaps tends mostly to get in the way of stories that belong to the talky kitchen-sink school of urban soap opera. While Hank Stokes (Larry Gilliard Jr.), a bright, athletic young black man of uncertain prospects, woos his Hispanic neighbor Joy (Barbara Gonzalez), Hank's father, Milt (Wendell Holmes), strikes up a romance with Joy's adoptive Italian-American mother, Florence (Suzanne Costallos). As the two couples seal their attachments, the movie briefly becomes a tenement-bound French farce, with various lovers sneaking in and out of windows and over rooftops and fire escapes to avoid detection. The frayed thread of a plot linking these and other vignettes is Hank's fantasy of escaping his neighborhood by winning the lottery. When a ticket worth $27 million is purchased at the liquor store where he works for Florence stacking the shelves, lottery fever grips the neighborhood. Who purchased the winning ticket? Might it have been Papi (Jaime Tirelli), a babbling neighborhood drunk who has been jailed for dealing crack? Adding a note of pathos is the fact that Papi is Joy's biological father. He abandoned her but still lives in the neighborhood, where she gives him the cold shoulder whenever he appears. Although ""Lotto Land"" is set in the present, it has odd William Inge-like echoes. A scene in phich Florence agrees to give up ice cream if Milt will give up booze, in particular, recalls the homey backyard prattle of ""Come Back Little Sheba."" The older couple's decision to make love after years of abstinence is rendered in demure sugar-coated dialogue that rings false, even though the actors give it their best try. The film's biggest mystery isn't who won the lottery but what makes its young protagonist tick. Mr. Gilliard, the earnest actor who was the troubled center of gravity of Matty Rich's film ""Straight Out of Brooklyn,"" makes Hank a clean-cut bundle of potential. But aside from the character's obsession with the lottery, the movie forgot to give him a personality.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. For a couple of minutes in the midst of David O. Russell's sneaky, sidesplitting ""Flirting With Disaster,"" Mel Coplin (Ben Stiller) finds himself the brother of tawny blond volleyball-playing twins. This happy if impermanent accident is nothing unusual for Mr. Russell's wonderfully mad odyssey of a movie, in which a man sets out to find his biological parents and winds up meeting more weirdos than Alice found down the rabbit hole. Mel's search for his birth parents is nominally what sets this enchantingly loony comedy in motion. That sounds almost ordinary, but it quickly becomes clear that Mr. Russell could spin inspired zaniness out of a trip to the grocery store. Having made an enormously confident feature debut with ""Spanking the Monkey,"" Mr. Russell now takes a huge, successful leap into wild ensemble comedy, working with a stellar cast and a remarkable number of tricks up his sleeve. ""Flirting With Disaster"" bears less resemblance to his earlier film than it does to ""The In-Laws,"" another hilarious road movie that starts small and finds itself spiraling into the strangest places.""Flirting With Disaster,"" which is vastly more colorful than its tame title, begins reasonably enough with a meeting between Mel and Tina Kalb (Tea Leoni), whose manner is chic and professional even though it's not precisely clear what business she's in. Proclaiming it her mission to reunite Mel with his natural parents, Tina also lets it be known that she's getting divorced, used to be a dancer and sometimes thinks it might be wise to get herself impregnated by a reasonably intelligent man. Meanwhile, Mel has already impregnated Nancy (Patricia Arquette), his wife, who is just regaining her sexual wiles after the birth of a new baby when she finds Tina parked in her living room. If ""Flirting With Disaster"" were a conventional comedy, it would settle for that premise and the ""Friends""-like fact that Mel and Nancy both work at the Museum of Natural History. Here, however, the Mel-Nancy-Tina situation is nothing but square one. Next comes a visit to the parents who raised Mel, played deliciously by Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal. She nags a lot and likes showing off her body. (""I want you to consider my age and ask yourself how I maintain this,"" she declares, lifting her sweater.) He worries about carjackers in San Diego and uranium poisoning in New Mexico, both of which actually do figure later in the story. So does Mel's father's 60th birthday, which Mel forgets, thus bringing out his mother's priceless frostiness. ""It's all right, we'll try it again when he turns 65,"" she says. ""Provided he lives that long. And you're not busy.""Mel and Nancy have dragged Tina along to explain their mission to the Coplins (""This woman strikes me as being very dangerous,"" says Ms. Moore, glaring at Ms. Leoni), which becomes part of a larger pattern. Extra characters tag along everywhere as the story gets wilder and woollier in ways it would be a shame to ruin. Since this story thrives so delightfully on the unexpected, let's just say that it makes uproarious stops in San Diego, the Southwestern desert and somewhere near the home of Kellogg's Sugar Frosted Flakes. The film also does for bed and breakfasts what ""Tootsie"" did for mimes. (Remember when Dustin Hoffman finally slugged one?) And it has particular fun with the artifacts of ancient hippie culture, which one character describes succinctly as ""Jerry Garcia, blah, blah, blah.""Even explaining the roles of some characters would ruin a surprise or two. So suffice it to say that Mr. Russell has cast the film without a misstep, and that the actors showing off various new sides of themselves include Alan Alda (delivering wicked self-parody), Lily Tomlin, Richard Jenkins, Celia Weston and Josh Brolin. Throughout it all, Mr. Stiller makes a superb straight man, while Ms. Arquette fumes beautifully, and Ms. Leoni shows off a sleek resemblance to Annette Bening and fine comic style. Ms. Moore, cast against type with droll effectiveness, delivers the film's whopper of a last line.""Flirting With Disaster"" shows off fine, nimble cinematography by Eric Edwards, whose credits include all of Gus Van Sant's films. It also benefits greatly from the slow, teasing rhythms of Mr. Russell's distinctive comic style. Mr. Russell isn't afraid to let a long scene build gradually until it gets where it's headed. Audiences won't mind, either. Thanks to this film maker's fine comic acumen, the payoff is always there.""Flirting With Disaster"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, numerous sexual references and a few sexual situations. FLIRTING WITH DISASTERWritten and directed by David O.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. You might describe ""Flirt,"" Hal Hartley's smart, sexy, wafer-light new movie, as a jauntily romantic theme and variations on young love, international style. Hopscotching from New York to Berlin to Tokyo, the film flaunts the perilously cute concept of telling the same story in three different places with three sets of characters speaking three different languages. Watching the movie is like eating ice cream -- or is it ice milk? -- in three different flavors: vanilla, chocolate and green tea. They go together nicely.""Flirt,"" which the New York Film Festival is showing at Alice Tully Hall tonight at 6 and tomorrow night at 11:30, is no ""Rashomon."" But neither is it a dry exercise in cross-cultural style. In an airy, self-assured way, the three episodes suggest a common denominator of romantic attitudes (with significant differences from place to place) among the young, hip and urbane of three continents. If commitment is difficult, the movie implies, it is because love is so easy to come by, and the grass is always greener. In the artsy milieus the film visits, it is no big deal when love crosses conventional barriers of race, age and sexual orientation. The fly in the ointment, which all the liberation in the world can't seem to eliminate, is jealousy.""Flirt"" begins in New York with Bill (Bill Sage), a handsome ladies' man whose girlfriend, Emily (Parker Posey), is about to leave for a vacation in Paris. Once there, she warns, she might hook up with an old lover unless Bill commits to her within the next 90 minutes. Bill loves Emily but has an itch for the wife of his close friend Walter (Martin Donovan). Running into him in a bar, Bill finds Walter carrying a gun and threatening suicide. His wife has left him, Walter announces, and he accuses Bill of having designs on her. During an ambiguous tussle for the gun, the weapon goes off, grazing Bill's face. As he is painfully stitched up in a hospital emergency room, he is encouraged to think of something pleasant and murmurs his sexual fantasies to the attendant nurses, who are clearly aroused. Then he dashes off for the airport.""Flirt"" retells the same story twice more, but each time the personalities and details are different enough to make the new version fresh. In Berlin, the main character, Dwight (Dwight Ewell), is a saucy young black American who swivels around in black leather pants and a gold shirt while weighing his relationship with Johan, an older German art dealer. Dwight's latest crush is Werner, a middle-aged German painter who has just left his wife, Greta, in a state of suicidal despondency. The final flirt is Miho (Miho Nikaidoh), a Japanese dance student whose boyfriend, an American film maker, is about to go to Los Angeles. When rumors of Miho's flirtation with her dance teacher, Ozu, drive Ozu's wife to threaten to shoot herself, Ozu asks Miho to dispose of his wife's gun, and Miho finds herself pursued by the police and arrested for possession of a deadly weapon. Although ""Flirt' doesn't stray very far from lighthearted comic realism, it follows the film maker's earlier movies in slipping in some delightful bits of absurdism. In the funniest recurrent set piece, each flirt impulsively blurts out his romantic confusion to a bunch of strangers and is heatedly regaled with advice that is as amusing as it is wildly contradictory. At least one of the respondents offers a spontaneous disquisition that sounds like a parody of scholarly analysis. The emergency room sequences are completely different from one another. Where Bill is fawned over with discreet lust, Dwight is treated with calm detachment, and Miho with frantic desperation. Although the sexual fantasies that the characters use to distract themselves from the pain of Novocaine injections are very different, they share the image of ""spooning,"" which they explain is lying curled up side by side with their lovers. Whatever the language, Mr. Hartley's characters all speak in a way that often carries a deadpan comic edge. By the end of the film, certain phrases have acquired the quality of riddles. When one lover asks another if the two of them have a future, yes or no, the response has cryptic resonance: ""You don't have to see it if you know it's there.""""Flirt"" is exactly what its title implies, an artful tease that is more serious than it looks, but far from the last word on the uneasy comings and goings of modern love. In Ryc Montgomery's short film ""The Beast,"" which opens the program, an animal researcher who has figured out how to electronically translate monkey thoughts into human speech demonstrates his discovery in a crowded courtroom. This clever, mean-spirited film seduces the viewer into falling for an adorable chimp named Martha, then gleefully pulls the rug out.

John Duigan's ""Flirting"" is the second low-key, easy-to-take installment in the Australian film maker's projected trilogy about the coming of age of Danny Embling (Noah Taylor), the sensitive young fellow introduced in ""The Year My Voice Broke,"" released four years ago. The new film opens today at the Carnegie Hall Cinemas. In ""Flirting,"" set in 1965, Danny has been packed off to a fairly fancy boarding school where life is no easier than it was at home. As he notes on the soundtrack, there is no privacy at the school: ""You're surrounded 24 hours a day. Either you become a herd animal or you dig a cave deep inside your head"" in which to hide. Danny is still a very idealized odd-kid-out. He reads Sartre. When he has to assume a fake identity, he calls himself Camus.""Flirting"" is mostly about Danny's first, very tentative love affair, with Thandiwe (Thandie Newton), who attends the girls' boarding school just across the lake. Thandiwe is bright, funny and exceptionally pretty, though being from Uganda and black, she feels disconnected from the small world around her, much as Danny does for much fuzzier reasons. In spite of the pressures on Danny and Thandiwe, their lives and their groping affair go along with remarkably few serious problems. They are able to meet at dances, and then during rehearsals for a play that is being put on as a co-production by the two schools. The teachers at both schools are strict, but they seem never to realize that students frequently make night voyages across the lake in rowboats to visit one another. There is a kind of painless calm about ""Flirting."" The film is simultaneously attractive and just a little dull. Mr. Duigan avoids melodrama, which is all to the good. Yet his gift for the acutely observed commonplace detail is neither strong nor original enough to transform the movie into something comparable to so many similar, better films. The best things about ""Flirting"" are the performances. Ms. Newton is delightful as Thandiwe, who is far more sophisticated than Danny and wise enough never to let him know it. Mr. Taylor is also good, although the troubled Danny is not an easy character to play. He's virtually the generic artist-as-a-young-man. Nicole Kidman appears in a supporting role as one of Thandiwe's older classmates, who is less of a snob than she first appears. Mr. Duigan has announced that Mr. Taylor will again play Danny in the trilogy's final film, which is to be set in Paris but won't be made until his star grows a bit older. It seems likely that Danny will finally emerge as a writer, a painter or maybe even a film maker. It's a cinch he won't be on his way up in the world of international banking.

His past slapsticks have had their amusing moments, but this has none. It is as devoid of humor as it is of originality; and its barrenness in that latter particular can be realized by a simple statement of some of the comic novelties the film contains.

""" Flirtation Walk,"" or Life Among the Cadets, at the Strand -- ""The Captain Hates the Sea."" - The New York Times","See the article in its original context from November 29, 1934, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. George M. Cohan having demonstrated the chemical effect of waving a flag at an audience, the Warner Brothers have now taken his timid little experiment and made something big out of it in ""Flirtation Walk,"" which had a packed and ululant house howling with patriotic fervor at the Strand last night. Outside the Strand, under the white and blistering arc lamps, an American Legion band set the mood for the evening with a stirring military air. You went to your seat prepared to give until it hurt, and ""Flirtation Walk,"" for a longish hundred minutes, nursed the emotion into a mild hysteria under the persuasive and romantic cameras of Frank Borzage. A rousing recruiting poster, the new photoplay tells of the raptures, the sentimental joys, the minor difficulties and the collegiate fun of life among the institutional lads at the Military Academy. Mr. Borzage, for the benefit of those who came in late, gives the last scene everything he has. On a widened screen the Cadets march sternly and proudly to receive their commissions and take up their glorious destinies as defenders of the Constitution. In the grandstand, Ruby Keeler and Sergeant Pat O'Brien lift their tear-filled eyes as Dick Powell marches past at the head of the parade, while a stiff breeze whips the flag gallantly across the screen. The Warners dedicate ""Flirtation Walk"" to West Point in a friendly prefatory note, for it was there that many of the scenes were made with, the program reports, ""the full cooperation of the United States Army."" Once the camera permits us a tender glimpse at the bronze plaques which mark the rooms where Generals Pershing and MacArthur once studied as cadets. Stripped of its glamourous military setting, it is to be feared that ""Flirtation Walk"" would yield the unlikely and faintly surprised look of a plucked pullet. But the Academy background has been woven into the picture with a great sum of sheer skill, and the photoplay emerges as a pleasant conventional comedy, as well as a splendid laboratory specimen of the adolescent cinema. It provides further evidence, if any were needed, of the vast popularity of the lyric team of Miss Keeler and Mr. Powell, which is certainly one of the major phenomena of the current screen. To the musical comedy emotions which go with a musical comedy story, they pursue their amorous and social difficulties with the shy and wholesome demeanor which has made their names a symbol for good, clean, romantic fun on the screen. This time Mr. Powell is a private in a Hawaiian army post, where the hearty and excellent Pat O'Brien plays the tough boy. Miss Keeler, the daughter of one of the generals, toys with Mr. Powell's heart one romantic evening. Fed up, as the leathernecks say, with dames, he wins an appointment to West Point, where he pursues his studies with exemplary vigor and austerity. Four years later Miss Keeler turns up at the Point with her father, who is the new commandant. After some preliminary fencing on Flirtation Walk, under the Kissing Rock, and in the annual academy show, in which they both participate, the young people decide that nothing else matters after all. For the purposes of Mr. Powell's sunny tenor, the song-smiths have put together several agreeable tunes. ""I See Two Lovers,"" ""Mister and Misses Is the Names,"" ""When Do We Eat?"" and ""Flirtation Walk,"" of which the Mister and Missis number promises to earn a brief immortality on the lips of the nation's amateur tenors. Several attractive young men, including Ross Alexander, Glen Boles, John Arledge and John Darrow, pretend to he military comrades of Mr. Powell and assist with the undergraduate fun. Henry O'Neill as the kindly general is, as always, the most pleasant of acting men. From all the evidence, ""Flirtation Walk"" seems to be assured of a large and enthusiastic clientele, and it seems unlikely that the patriotic cinema public will let the Military Academy or the gallant producers down.

The screen offerings at the Warner Theatre are varied. They go from the ridiculous to the sublime or the sublime to the ridiculous, according to the time one enters the cinema. After having listened to the silly patter in the feature, ""The Naughty Flirt,"" and witnessing the energetic Daphne Pollard in ""The Cat's Paw,"" one is privileged to hear Douglas Stanbury sing Joyce Kilmer's beautiful poem, ""Trees.""As for the film, ""The Naughty Flirt,"" in which Alice White is the leading player, it is a production in which it is as difficult to find something to praise as it is to find a needle in a haystack. After Alan J. Ward, acted by Paul Page, has told Kay Elliott (Miss White) that she is a total loss, the blue-eyed blonde retorts by telling him vehemently to go jump in the lake, a favorite expression with her. For some reason or other this exchange of heated vernacular results in kindling further affection for Kay in Ward's capacious heart. The picture might have ended here with a cuddle and a kiss, but the producers see fit to have something happen that will cause the young lovers to be at daggers' points. None of the characters being blessed with much in the way of intelligence, it is quite simple for Jack Gregory, who is himself smitten with Kay's charms, and his sister, Linda, to compromise Ward. Kay, however, being apparently a true believer in suspense, stands up before a justice of the peace to be married to Jack, but when she is asked whether she will have Jack Gregory to be her husband that she replies in the negative. So all ends well in ""The Naughty Flirt,"" for it is only a matter of half an hour or so before Ward takes Jack's place and Kay ends a life of flirtations and marriage proposals and acceptances, by becoming Mrs. Alan J. Ward. This picture keeps to the orthodox idea of having a cocktail shaker in evidence part of the time. There are also scenes of dancing and in one of them one slipper from each girl is put in the centre of the floor and the men are asked to pick up whatever slipper they can and the owner is their partner for the evening. As it has been stated, however, there is Mr. Stanbury's rendition of the inspiring words of Joyce Kilmer's poem, which causes one to leave this theatre in a happier frame of mind if one harkens to it after having beheld the tedious antics in ""The Naughty Flirt.""Cocktails, Youth and Dancing.

Everybody joins in the chorus of laughter that rings through the Rivoli Theatre during the screening of Bebe Daniel's latest comedy, ""The Campus Flirt."" The main idea of this hilarious affair is assuredly no newer than that of most stories, but Clarence Badger has handled it with enthusiasm and imagination, and it is therefore by all odds the best mirth-making subject in which Miss Daniels has been seen. While the situations are so absurd that they remind one of the old-fashioned race track yarns, they are none the less funny. This effusion deals with a little snob, a co-educational college and a relay race in which girls are the contestants. A title like ""The Mouse and the Monocle"" would have been more suitable to this photoplay than the suggestion of ""The College Widow,"" for, surprising as it may seem, a mouse does his bit in this yarn and so does a monocle. The eyeglass denotes the snob, and is worn by Patricia Mansfield, whose European affectation has to be cured by a course in a tried and trusted co-educational institution. Patricia is accustomed to suites rather than sharing a room with another girl. She endeavors to be haughty with her monocle, but only succeeds in arousing ridicule. She is eager to belong to a sorority and is surprised that the members are selected and not admitted through application. The monocle aided and abetted in all her weird ideas of so-called blue-blooded culture. The mouse then turns up on the scene. He is a nice little white mouse, nonchalant at times and frequently tenacious. The animal is the property of a well-meaning hayseed traveling under the euphonic appellation of Knute Knudson. The mouse escapes on more than one occasion, but the time that it serves its Alma Mater best is when it seeks refuge on Patricia's ankle while she is watching the girls run a race. Patricia never intended to join them, but the sudden discovery that her ankle might be bitten by the horrid mouse, causes her to run, and she runs so fast that she leaves the other girls far behind. It is, therefore, not astonishing that Charlie Paddock, incidentally impersonated by the crack runner, should wish to have the flet-footed Patricia take part in the college relay race. There is the customary idea of suspense, worked out in quite an original fashion. And the producers have not omitted to have a nice-looking young man who falls in love with Patricia. This hero is played by James Hall, who is quite satisfactory. Miss Daniels keeps the momentum of the picture going in a violent fashion. Mr. Paddock, the champion runner, is natural as the trainer. Ralph Spence and ""Rube"" Goldberg are responsible for the clever titles.""American Beauties"" is the title of John Murray Anderson's stage offering, which posses originality, but has a little too much dancing. It deals, of course, with the Atlantic City beauty pageant, and has no little charm in its artistic effects. The Monocle and the Mouse.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.""Married Flirts,"" the photoplay version of Louis Joseph Vance's novel, ""Mrs. Paramor,"" is a bright and entertaining film, equipped with clever epigramatic subtitles. Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld's music score adds to the interest of this picture, as it not only fills the place of captions in certain stretches, but also stirs the audience to outbursts of laughter. One sees a husband scolding his wife, the accompaniment to this scene being staccato blasts from the gruffer wind instruments, while the woman's reply is told by the modulated and slender tones of the clarinet. Spectators usually find something funny in a character's discomfort. Mrs. Rex (Mae Busch) is obviously suffering from mal de mer when making an ocean crossing aboard the Mauretania. The peope in the theatre tittered at her unhappy expression, but they let forth peals of merriment when the stewardess brought to Mrs. Rex's cabin a grilled steak and vegetables, which the indisposed passenger waved away, not being able even to bear the sight of such edibles. Meanwhile the susceptible Mr. Rex (Conrad Nagel) is on deck enjoying the society of the captivating Mrs. Paramor, an authoress who writes about her knowledge of men. She says that ""dear Mr. Rex is such a generous individual that he even gives himself, away."" Mrs. Paramor, who had left her husband, impersonated by Huntly Gordon, because of his attentions to Mrs. Rex, before the latter was married, is having her innings at the flirting game. Being rather clever she leaves no stone unturned to make the younger woman jealous. She sends Rex books with tenderly written epistles, gives him forget-me-nots as a dinner favor and is always at home when he calls. When Mrs. Rex discovers the books from Mrs. Paramor, she takes out half a dozen volumes from her own library and tells her husband: ""A book a day will keep the dumbells away.""There is an interesting dinner party scene in which May McAvoy, Robert Z. Leonard and his wife. Mae Murray, are among the guests. The screen celebrities receive as dinner favors doll caricatures of themselves. Just before Mrs. Rex is leaving for Reno, which in the text is alluded to as ""The Great Divide,"" she approaches Mrs. Paramor and asks the latter whether she really loves Rex. The novelist replies that she does ""in a way.""Pauline Frederick is especially good as Mrs. Paramor, it being a rôle suited to her type and qualifications. Mae Busch is amusing and charming as the petulant young Mrs. Rex. Mr. Gordon and Mr. Nagel are capable as the two husbands, so susceptible and, in the end, so sorry. This is a light comedy, a frivolous film with a certain charm, which is an excellent attraction for all those who want to be entertained and have a gentle laugh every now and again. Tit for Tat. MARRIED FLIRTS, with Pauline Frederick, Mae Busch, Conrad Nagel, Huntly Gordon, Patterson Dial, Paul Nicholson, Alice Hollister and others, adapted from Louis Joseph Vance's novel. ""Mrs. Paramor,"" directed by Robert G. Vignola; ""The Bullfight,"" a Fox educational; Souvenir,"" a violin trio; ""Go Easy,"" a Cameo comedy; Marie Cavan, soprano. At the Rialto. Those who visit the Broadway this week will find an agreeable surprise awaiting them in the pictorial effort called ""The Midnight Express,"" which is a far better production than one is apt to gather from the title. Although it deals with trains thundering along mountain curves and the wayward son of a railroad President, the story is unfolded with skill and imagination. George W. Hill, who produced ""The Hill Billy,"" with Jack Pickford, also directed this current effort. In ""The Midnight Express,"" one sees a film which is carefully edited and well titled. Mr. Hill, who, before he directed Jack Pickford's picture, was a camera man, is credited also with the adaptation of the story. The players are quite satisfactory, Elaine Hammerstein having the rôle of Mary Travers and William Hames that of the hero, Jack Oakes, George Nichols, whose face is so familiar to those who go to motion pictures theatres, figures as the severe but affectionate father. Pat Harmon is cast as ""Silent Bill"" Brachely, a convict. In the introductory scenes Jack is depicted having a wild time with cocktails and automobiles, while his father is shown afterward, engrossed in work aboard his private car. The old man tells his son to get out of the house, but also instructs a detective to shadow the young man. Jack in the beginning is characterized by one of the wild female contingent as being as yellow as his money, and it is not until he is forced to fight that he becomes a real man. While working in the railroad yard, he meets Mary Travers, with whom he eventually falls in love. The father, hearing of his son's affection for Mary, decides to call on her. He asks her what she knows, and the girl, ignorant of his identity, tells him;: ""Nothing to tell an impertinent old man."" This amuses Mr. Oakes, who obviously takes a decided liking to his prospective daughter-in-law, but at the same time does not tell her that her sweetheart is his son. One thrilling part of this narrative is where Jack espies a felon in a telegraph office. He writes on a telegraph form: ""The man at my right is a dangerous criminal. Watch him while I get the police."" The operator takes the message and pretends, to count the words, and then nods to Jack. The crook is caught and locked in a cell, after vowing he will revenge himself on Jack. Mr. Hill solicitously permits this convict to smoke cigarettes while he is behind the bars. The escape of this man leads to a stirring fight just when the midnight express is in danger of crashing into three uncoupled freight cars tearing down the incline. The interest in this story is sustained throughout, and most of the action is realistic. Miss Hammerstein's big eyes are a help to this picture. She looks uncommonly attractive in a chintz dress, when attending to the duties in her rose-covered cottage near the railroad. Mr. Haines is acceptable as the hero, but his face is invariably a little too clean when he is working in the repair shop Mr. Nichols is splendid as the father, who in one scene is served by his butler alone in a great dining room. He makes the audience laugh when he takes off his dinner jacket and finishes his meal in his shirt sleeves. Charlie Chaplin is also to be seen in a reissue of ""The Pilgrim,"" which it is never too late to see. Sceen Notes.""The Silent Accuser,"" with Peter the Great, a police dog, is to be the film feature next week at the Capitol.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. GOLF: It's a four-letter word, and definitely not one associated with sex appeal. Yet Ron Shelton accomplishes the unimaginable with his bright, stylish, ridiculously alluring new film. Hard as it may be to believe, Mr. Shelton's ''Tin Cup'' is a flirty, funny comedy set right there on the links, with all the right raffish echoes of his earlier ''Bull Durham.'' ''Tin Cup'' has such unexpected flair that the game takes on new cachet, to the point where even golf clothes look good. So do the stars. Kevin Costner gives a terrifically likable performance, rekindling all the insouciant charm he showed in ''Bull Durham'' and dispelling any thought that ''Waterworld'' carried him off the deep end. Rene Russo, who has provided much more than window-dressing in a string of huge hits, finally gets a full-fledged comic role and a chance to shine. As the third partner in one of Mr. Shelton's trademark romantic triangles, Don Johnson makes a fine troublemaker, swaggering through the film with complacent glee. And as for Cheech Marin -- well, anyone who predicted 20 years ago that Mr. Marin would ever play a wise caddy would have been told he had tees on the brain. But here is Mr. Marin, sounding gruffly funny and looking right at home. Starting off in the land of the lazy armadillo and flaunting its laid-back appeal right from the opening credits (Mr. Shelton has assembled a rollicking good country-blues soundtrack), ''Tin Cup'' celebrates the underdog status of Roy (Tin Cup) McAvoy. Roy is straight out of Margaritaville: he's a serenely soused loser with a talent for enjoying failure in style. Stuck in dusty little Salome, Tex., Roy lives in a trailer and runs a driving range, where he golfs a little and loafs a lot, with his battered red Cadillac and wardrobe of floppy Hawaiian shirts. Mr. Marin, as Roy's devoted sidekick, manages to be pricelessly funny just by announcing that Roy is ''in Houston on business.'' That's some whopper, under the circumstances. When it comes to business, Roy has practically none until the beautiful Dr. Molly Griswold (Ms. Russo) shows up for golf lessons. Rising to the occasion, Roy delivers one of Mr. Shelton's grandly hyperbolic odes to sports, which makes for a memorably funny and teasing first encounter. At such moments, Mr. Shelton can make his characters sound florid and facetious while they speak from the heart, a mixture that becomes vastly appealing no matter how much it's overblown. Describing the golf swing in loving detail, complete with its ''nod to the gods'' and ''tuning fork in the loins,'' Roy sums up his theory with some advice: ''Waggle it and let the big dog eat.'' Even moviegoers who are golf-averse, and should not make the mistake of missing ''Tin Cup'' for that reason, are bound to acknowledge that Roy has the gift of gab and many other interesting talents, like his way of using a golf club to scratch himself. (The screenplay is by Mr. Shelton and John Norville, who is a first-time screenwriter and the film maker's golfing buddy.)Anyway, once sparks fly between Roy and Molly, he becomes unnaturally interested in her practice as a psychotherapist at the Salome Wellness Center. (Among the film's little jokes: that Salome could support such a place, and that a worldly beauty like Molly would wind up in West Texas at all. She got there, she later tells Roy, because of a cowboy from Amarillo. Cowboy? ''It's not as romantic when you're actually with one,'' Molly explains. ''Trust me.'')Roy considers attracting Molly's attention by becoming her patient. ''Perhaps I'm chock-full of inner demons,'' he muses. But this doesn't work, since Molly's assessment of Roy's demons is not kind. And anyway, Molly is attached to David Simms (Mr. Johnson), a smug star golfer who is Roy's longtime rival. What to do?''Well,'' suggests Romeo (Mr. Marin), ''you could go out and win the U. S. Open, Roy. That would impress her.''Indeed. So with that deadpan challenge, ''Tin Cup'' is quite literally off to the races. While the first part of the film has devoted itself to all forms of fooling around (including Roy's taking bets that he can win a round of golf using garden tools instead of clubs), the second part concentrates on serious sports competition, which Mr. Shelton stages well enough to communicate real drama. A number of actual golf stars flank Mr. Costner as Roy rises from oblivion to engage in what he calls, with typical understatement, ''the pursuit of a mythic destiny.''And after all its golf-related clowning (like the sequence when Roy bets he can hit a ball from inside a clubhouse and knock an outdoor pelican off its post), the film turns serious about expressing its credo. As in ''Bull Durham,'' sports philosophy is cheerfully expanded into a larger theory about life, and Mr. Shelton conveys his thinking with passion. Setting out on a ''Rocky'' trajectory toward the triumph of a little guy from nowhere, ''Tin Cup'' actually arrives at a more interesting destination. This film's overriding message is as pleasing as its flippant, skillful banter. Beyond Mr. Shelton's obvious achievements in locating romance where no one else might have found it and in matching his own ''Bull Durham'' high note ''Tin Cup'' also stands out for the jokey rapport of its leading men and Ms. Russo's breezy comic performance. And now that his heroine has evolved from baseball groupie (Susan Sarandon's gorgeous sports muse in ''Bull Durham'') to quasi-doctor (Molly has a checkered past, which makes her just right for Roy), Mr. Shelton also delivers more of a sweetly romantic women's picture than he has in the past. He does that without sacrificing the manly grit of a long golf match or the requisite episode involving strippers, which is quick and played for laughs. One dancer has a gag about trying to make a costume out of two sunflowers and a Davy Crockett hat. Everyone cringes. In stripping, as in this film's brand of golf, poor form is tragic, but perfect style is everything.''Tin Cup'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, fleeting nudity and brief, discreet sexual situations.

One day in the remote Australian village of Poona Flat, strange music drops out of the sky, and a little boy named John Anderson has an epiphany. It is 1969. A cargo plane carrying members of a jazz ensemble has been diverted to the outback for an unscheduled layover. As the villagers stare, dumbfounded, seven musicians file onto the runway and give an impromptu jazz concert. John is riveted by the sounds coming from the trumpet of the group's lead player, Billy Cross (Miles Davis). ""You seemed tuned into it,"" Billy tells the star-struck boy afterward. ""If you ever come to Paris, look me up.""So begins Rolf de Heers's film ""Dingo,"" a wildly romantic story about a jazz musician in pursuit of his muse. The 1991 film, which opens a two-week engagement today at Cinema Village, jumps forward two decades. John (Colin Friels), now married and the father of two girls, ekes out a living trapping the Australian wild dogs known as dingos. A largely self-taught trumpeter who has learned the instrument by studying Billy Cross records, he plays on weekends with a local ""bush band,"" whose skiffle-style rock-and-roll has nothing to do with jazz. Alone in the desert, he aims his instrument at the sky and produces lonely warbling doglike cries that echo the sounds of his idol's records, and earn him the nickname Dingo. John, who corresponds with Billy's agent, has secretly saved $3,000 for a trip to Paris to reunite with his boyhood idol. In the last third of the movie, when he makes the trip, the film changes from a gritty portrait of a talented musician's frustrated life in the Australian boondocks into a starry-eyed fantasy of the jazz life in Paris. Within hours of his arrival, not only does John find himself treated like Billy's long-lost soul mate, he also wows the audience at an improbable jam session in a smart Parisian club.""Dingo,"" which switches abruptly back and forth between Australia and Paris, is a film with a seriously split personality. Just when the scenes of Billy playing in the local band, trapping dingos and squabbling with his wife, Jane (Helen Buday), have begun to cohere into a pungent portrait of Australian rural life, the movie fantasizes the Parisian jazz life as a millionaire's dream world. Despite strong, volatile performances by Mr. Friels and Ms. Buday, neither half of the story ultimately gets its due. And a subplot in which Jane is tempted to run off with her husband's wealthy childhood pal Peter (Joe Petruzzi) seems extraneous. In his dramatic-film debut, Davis, who died in September 1991, suggests an eccentric variation of his famously reclusive, enigmatic self. Sartorially eccentric and glowering through sunglasses with gold-studded frames, he delivers his lines in a gravelly whisper, with no facial expression at all. Although the film's discontinuities are somewhat redeemed by its score, composed by Michel Legrand and Davis, and featuring the trumpets of Davis and Chuck Findley, the music doesn't begin to make the film's two halves fit together. DINGO Directed by Rolf de Heer; written by Marc Rosenberg; director of photography, Denis Lenoir; edited by Suresh Ayyar; music by Michel Legrand and Miles Davis; production designer, Judith Russell; produced by Mr. de Heer, Giorgio Draskovic, Marie-Pascale Osterrieth and Mr. Rosenberg; released by Greycat Films.

NEW DIRECTORS/ NEW FILMS; 'BALLAD OF NARAYAMA' BY SHOHEI IMAMURA - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from April 9, 1984, Section C, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. NATURE is so rich and the life force so rampant in Shohei Imamura's ''The Ballad of Narayama'' that, after a preview screening, I was almost relieved to walk out into the man-made pollution of Times Square. Nature, thus prettified by Mr. Imamura, is almost as artifical as a world in which a virgin forest has been removed to make way for a cement-paved parking lot. The new Japanese film, based on the same Shichiro Fukazawa stories that inspired Keisuke Kinoshita's 1958 film of the same name, means to be an ironic but life-affirming commentary on our so-called civilization by contrasting it with the manners and customs in a primitive Japanese mountain village 100 years ago. Existence is not easy in the mountain village. Famine always threatens. The population is controlled mainly by tossing out newborn male children to die in the rice paddies. Female babies are retained for potential childbearing. If, by chance, a village elder has not died by age 70, the eldest child must carry the old person to a secret place near the summit of Mount Narayama, where the ancient one is left to die of starvation and exposure. In this fashion the community makes sure that there will be enough food for the survival of the rest of the villagers. Like the Kinoshita film, Mr. Imamura's is concerned mainly with a hard-working, tough, 69-year-old woman named Orin, whose family includes two grown sons, one a widower and one a possibly simple-minded bachelor, and assorted grandchildren. Though she's in remarkably good shape, Orin feels that it's time she made the journey to Narayama. She's lived long enough and she's tired. Once she has found a new wife for her widowed son, as well as a woman who will consent to make love with the other son, she insists that Tatsuhei, the widower, carry out his obligations to her, the family and the community by making the trip up Narayama. This is the principal story of ''The Ballad of Narayama,'' which also includes subplots about the villagers' merciless punishment of a family of thieves - they are buried alive - and a somewhat more light-hearted one about a young woman whose dying father insists that she sleep with every man in the village to atone for his own incestuous indiscretion. Mr. Imamura is not a subtle film maker. He attempts to shock the audience into the realization that though this life order is harsh, it is beautiful in an efficiency that's prompted as much by love as by material needs. At one point, we watch old Orin as she systematically smashes out her teeth to be able to convince Tatsuhei that her years of usefulness are over. The director puts great store by visual repetitions that emphasize the oneness of all nature. When a young man and a young woman are making frantic love in a field, he shows us snakes, frogs, grasshoppers and birds engaged in similar pursuits. Unfortunately, an image of frogs, even in an amorous condition, evokes less wonder than amusement. In this world, it's not dog-eat-dog but snake-eat-rat and then, to balance things, rat-eat- snake, all seen in tight, nature-movie close-ups. He's also fond of sequences that announce the changing of the seasons. The winter landscape melts toward spring and climaxes in an explosion of buds and grass, accompanied by the chirping of birds and the babbling of brooks containing frisky trout. Though the performances are good, especially Sumiko Sakamoto's as Orin and Ken Ogata's as Tatsuhei, ''The Ballad of Narayama'' is too picturesque to reflect the simple austerity of the story it tells. The sophisticated photographic techniques, including the long, lovely helicopter shot of snow-covered mountains that opens the film, have little to do with the primitive lives contained in the movie itself. The ultimate effect is not to celebrate nature, or to shock us out of our civilized lethargy, but to exploit nature in a manner designed to impress jaded audiences without actually disturbing them. I'm not at all surprised that the movie won the grand prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival where, as I see it in my imagination, the audience applauded it madly and then went off to dine at three-star restaurants.''The Ballad of Narayama'' will be shown today at the 57th Street Playhouse at 6 and 8:30 P.

Screen: Taken From Japanese Legend:'Ballad of Narayama' Is Import at Carnegie Drama Is Stylized and Occasionally Graphic - The New York Times,"See the article in its original context from June 20, 1961, Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times’s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

VIEWING ""Ballad of Narayama,"" like tasting shark's fin soup for the first time, can be an exotic, if not a sobering, experience. The Japanese drama, which came to the Carnegie Hall Cinema yesterday, deals with the relationship between food, hunger, the weak and the strong, and life and death. It is stylized and occasionally graphic fare in the manner of the Kabuki Theatre, which is realistically staged, but decidedly strange to Western tastes. Drawing his material out of the limbo of ancient Nipponese legend, director Keisuke Kinoshita, who also adapted the original novel to the screen, is concerned mainly with the custom, harshly implacable to Occidental eyes, of transporting the aged and infirm rustic villagers to the barren heights of Mount Narayama, where a rough nature soon solves the problem of feeding and maintaining them. In the Japan of long ago that Mr. Kinoshita is illustrating at a sometimes painfully slow pace, the approach to the geriatric enigma was drastic but simple. Mr. Kinoshita, however, is not a simple man, apparently, nor is his method of dealing with his drama rudimentary or particularly lucid. His chief concern is Orin, a strong peasant woman nearing the age of 70, who is inured to the idea that perennial food shortages make this horrible sacrifice necessary. There is, too, her widowed son, a farmer faced with the constant small yield of his small plot that is insufficient to feed his family, including a new bride (a widow herself), his three small children and his selfish eldest son and his naïve mistress. But Orin is a hardy type who has accepted her fate and is attempting to set her house in order while her loving son, who rails against this barbaric custom, actually is an exception to the existing rules of behavior. There is a senile man, who has refused to make the ""pilgrimage"" to Narayama. His brutish son, in a variety of scenes, makes his anger plain and eventually kills him and is, in turn, killed. There is also a family that resorts to steading because of hunger, and is wiped out by the villagers. As is obvious, Mr. Kinoshita has fashioned his tale in slowly unfolding vignettes that rarely are direct or to the point. Although the film has been shot in Fujicolor and in Shochiku's Grandscope wide-screen process, both the backgrounds and the color give the impression of artificial, not naturalistic, screen settings. And, while the constant twanging of the samisen and the singers' keening of the musical score are authentic period Japanese, they tend to distract a Western observer. One, however, is likely to accept the English subtitles, such as ""life is like a passing dream,"" as being amusingly archaic but, nevertheless, in keeping with the people and the time depicted. As the matriarch Orin, Kinuyo Tanaka makes a strong and resoluie individual, whose like is easily recognizable. An indomitable mother kowtowing to the ways of her forbears, she is, nevertheless, anxious to see to it that her family lives as happily as possible before she makes her peace with her gods. Her performance is as modern as the twentieth century. The other principals, however, behave in the tradition of formalized Japanese acting. As her adoring son, Teiji Takahashi contributes a brief scene or two in the Western manner. Yuho Mochizuki, as his new wife, is plain and submissive. Danko Ichikawa, as his taunting eldest son, is abrupt and erratic, and Seiji Miyaguchi and Yunosuke Ito, as the senile villager and his coarse son, are explosive but not especially effective figures. They all make ""Ballad of Narayama"" an odd and colorful evocation of Japan's past that is only occasionally striking.

Nicole Garcia's ""Every Other Weekend"" is an elegant portrait of inarticulate decision and emotional disorder, about a woman who, having left her husband and two children to search for herself, finds no one there. That's just one way to read the new French film, opening today at the Cinema Third Avenue. ""Every Other Weekend"" may also be seen as some kind of feminist statement about a woman who seeks definition no matter what the cost to herself or to those around her. Miss Garcia, the actress (""Mon Oncle d'Amerique"") who makes her feature film directorial debut here, appears to have a real gift for dealing with her performers, including two quite extraordinary child actors. The screenplay, which she wrote in collaboration with several others, is not equally sharp. Camille (Nathalie Baye) is a once-popular television actress, whose face is still remembered though the name is not. She is going nowhere. Divorced from her husband, who has the custody of their children, she is now taking any assignment she can get. When the film opens, she's off to Vichy to be the emcee at a Rotary Club benefit. Because it's her weekend to have the children, she drags them along with her. They are Vincent (Joachim Serreau), a solemn 10-year-old with a passion for astronomy, and 5-year-old Gaelle (Felicie Pasotti), who laughs hysterically when her mother does cartwheels but feels more comfortable with the nanny she knows far better. Camille is not an ideal mother. She apparently loves her children, but she seems to make a point of not becoming subservient to them or, for that matter, of even paying attention to them. Preoccupied by her own thoughts, she doesn't notice when Gaelle is about to step onto the tracks at the Vichy station, or when Vincent wanders away on their arrival at the hotel. From the minute the children join Camille, there is an extraordinary sense of dread about everything that happens. Miss Garcia effectively places the audience in the shoes of Camille's disapproving ex-husband, Adrian (Miki Manojlovic). She dares the audience to sympathize with Camille's troubled psyche, which, unfortunately, remains fuzzily understood from start to finish.""Every Other Weekend"" works not through the coherence of character development or revelation, but through the vivid detail with which Miss Garcia dramatizes the several wild days that Camille and the children share on the road, running away from both Adrian and the police. Having left the Vichy affair in mid-performance, Camille puts the children into a rented car and takes off, seemingly determined to persuade Vincent and Gaelle to love her even if it means killing them in the process. She's not a good driver. She loses her purse and all her money. They spend one night sleeping on a beach, another in the car. Her casual ways scare Gaelle and mortify Vincent, who, like most other children his age, puts great store by conventional behavior. Yet the three seem to be on the point of a new understanding when something not completely irreversible happens. Miss Baye is excellent in a role that's both shadowy and showy. It's not by chance that her Camille is first seen in the middle of a strenuous morning workout. Her body is perfectly toned and fit, but it initially seems uninhabited. Some measure of the woman within comes during the Vichy show when Camille, to the nervousness of the audience, falls into helpless giggles after mispronouncing the name of one of the Rotarians. She's full of wounded pride and arrogance. There's a comic and moving scene in which Camille roughhouses with some children on the beach while her own children look worriedly on. Their confidence in her, when it comes, is hard won. The rapport between Miss Baye and young Mr. Serreau and Miss Posotti is remarkable, without an ounce of the sentimental nonsense that most directors, possibly to reassure themselves about their own happy childhoods, like to impose on such relationships in movies.""Every Other Weekend"" has the illusive manner of a fragment from some larger narrative, but it's good enough to leave you wanting to know more.
